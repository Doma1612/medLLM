Its surgical treatment is challenging because of its anatomically close relations to the optic nerve, carotid artery, ophthalmic artery, anterior clinoid process, and cavernous sinus, which hinder direct access. Despite recent technical advancements enabling risk reduction of this complication, postoperative deterioration of visual function remains a significant problem. Therefore, the goal of preserving and/or improving the visual outcome persists as a paramount concern. <b>Objective:</b> We propose optic foraminotomy as an alternative microsurgical technique for dorsal carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms clipping. As a secondary objective, the step by step of that technique and its benefits are compared to the current approach of anterior clinoidectomy. <b>Methods:</b> We present as an example two patients with superior carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms in which the standard pterional craniotomy, transsylvian approach, and optic foraminotomy were performed. Surgical techniques are presented and discussed in detail with the use of skull base dissections, microsurgical images, and original drawings. <b>Results:</b> Extensive opening of the optic canal and optic nerve sheath was successfully achieved in all patients allowing a working angle with the carotid artery for correct visualization of the aneurysm and further clipping. Significant visual acuity improvement occurred in both patients because of decompression of the optic nerve. <b>Conclusion:</b> Optic foraminotomy is an easy and recommended technique for exposing and treating superior carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms and allowing optic nerve decompression during the first stages of the procedure. It shows several advantages over the current anterior clinoidectomy technique regarding surgical exposure and facilitating visual improvement.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2021.681115/pdf

After a period with almost no cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, a resurgent Covid-19 outbreak began in mid-June 2021. Possible reasons for the resurgence were reduced vaccine effectiveness against the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and waning immunity. The extent of waning immunity of the vaccine against the delta variant in Israel is unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data on confirmed infection and severe disease collected from an Israeli national database for the period of July 11 to 31, 2021, for all Israeli residents who had been fully vaccinated before June 2021. We used a Poisson regression model to compare rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe Covid-19 among persons vaccinated during different time periods, with stratification according to age group and with adjustment for possible confounding factors.<h4>Results</h4>Among persons 60 years of age or older, the rate of infection in the July 11-31 period was higher among persons who became fully vaccinated in January 2021 (when they were first eligible) than among those fully vaccinated 2 months later, in March (rate ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.0). Among persons 40 to 59 years of age, the rate ratio for infection among those fully vaccinated in February (when they were first eligible), as compared with 2 months later, in April, was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.1). Among persons 16 to 39 years of age, the rate ratio for infection among those fully vaccinated in March (when they were first eligible), as compared with 2 months later, in May, was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.0). The rate ratio for severe disease among persons fully vaccinated in the month when they were first eligible, as compared with those fully vaccinated in March, was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9) among persons 60 years of age or older and 2.2 (95% CI, 0.6 to 7.7) among those 40 to 59 years of age; owing to small numbers, the rate ratio could not be calculated among persons 16 to 39 years of age.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings indicate that immunity against the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 waned in all age groups a few months after receipt of the second dose of vaccine.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8609604?pdf=render

The current report presents information on BoCV infections associated with enteric disease of postweaned beef cattle in Oklahoma. In 3 separate accessions from a single herd, 1 in 2012 and 2 in 2013, calves were observed with bloody diarrhea. One calf in 2012 died and was necropsied, and 2 calves from this herd died in 2013 and were necropsied. A third calf from another herd died and was necropsied. The gross and histologic diagnosis was acute, hemorrhagic colitis in all 4 cattle. Colonic tissues from all 4 animals were positive by fluorescent antibody testing and/or immunohistochemical staining for BoCV antigen. Bovine coronavirus was isolated in human rectal tumor cells from swabs of colon surfaces of all animals. The genomic information from a region of the S envelope region revealed BoCV clade 2. Detection of BoCV clade 2 in beef cattle in Oklahoma is consistent with recovery of BoCV clade 2 from the respiratory tract of postweaned beef calves that had respiratory disease signs or were healthy. Further investigations on the ecology of BoCV in cattle are important, as BoCV may be an emerging disease beyond the initial descriptions. Challenge studies are needed to determine pathogenicity of these strains, and to determine if current BoCV vaccines are efficacious against the BoCV clade 2 strains.",

The syndrome is characterized by a history of recent pharyngitis followed by ipsilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis and metastatic pulmonary abscesses and is a disease for which patients will seek medical care and advice. As most patients are admitted to the hospital under internal medicine, practitioners should be familiar with the usual signs and symptoms of Lemierre's syndrome along with its diagnosis and treatment. Controversy involves the choice and duration of antimicrobial therapy used for treatment and anticoagulation therapy for internal jugular vein thrombosis. As the diagnosis and management of this syndrome has generated controversy, an updated review of the literature and treatment recommendations may be helpful for providing optimal care for patients with this often unrecognized and confusing infection.",

They employ a novel means of stereotaxis based on regions of interest in the MR space and simple geometric principles, which eliminate the need for a stereotactic frame. This approach is appropriate for targets that are MR visible, and for whom the local anatomy and function are well characterized. It may also be appropriate for targets that do not have a well-described physiologic signature and for which clinical response to macrostimulation does not play a critical role. We will discuss the rationale and principles of this new technique as well as its advantages and disadvantages relative to awake, physiologically guided deep brain stimulation surgery.",

Vascular lesions destroy these nuclei in different combinations and produce sensorimotor and behavioral syndromes depending on which nuclei are involved. Tuberothalamic territory strokes produce impairments of arousal and orientation, learning and memory, personality, and executive function; superimposition of temporally unrelated information; and emotional facial paresis. Paramedian infarcts cause decreased arousal, particularly if the lesion is bilateral, and impaired learning and memory. Autobiographical memory impairment and executive failure result from lesions in either of these vascular territories. Language deficits result from left paramedian lesions and from left tuberothalamic lesions that include the ventrolateral nucleus. Right thalamic lesions in both these vascular territories produce visual-spatial deficits, including hemispatial neglect. Inferolateral territory strokes produce contralateral hemisensory loss, hemiparesis and hemiataxia, and pain syndromes that are more common after right thalamic lesions. Posterior choroidal lesions result in visual field deficits, variable sensory loss, weakness, dystonia, tremors, and occasionally amnesia and language impairment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These vascular syndromes reflect the reciprocal cerebral cortical-thalamic connections that have been interrupted and provide insights into the functional properties of the thalamus.",

The aim of the study is to confirm the effectiveness in terms of hearing rehabilitation.<h4>Setting</h4>The study involved a tertiary referral center in a hospital setting.<h4>Patients</h4>The study includes a report of two cases: a case of a Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) patient who received a MEDEL COMBI 40+ CI after a translabyrinthine surgery for removal of a large (4.0 cm) cystic VS; and a patient with a 1.2 cm VS in the only hearing ear who was submitted to the same strategy and operation, using a Nucleus 24 Contour CI.<h4>Interventions</h4>The whole strategy used in the two mentioned cases is outlined, including decision making, surgical interventions, and hearing rehabilitation programs.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Surgical and audiometric outcome of two patients who underwent VS resection through a translabyrinthine approach and simultaneous cochlear implantation are shown.<h4>Results</h4>Postoperative results demonstrate that a CI could be successful after a translabyrinthine surgery for VS, with hearing performances similar to the best postlingual implanted deaf adults of other origin.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present cases demonstrate that cochlear implantation can be successful after a translabyrinthine approach for VS, regardless of the tumor size, the kind of patient (NF2, unilateral VS), and the type of implant. The results also are suggestive that cochlear implantation is more successful if done concurrent with surgery for tumor removal and before hearing is completely lost.",

Present systemic therapies rarely provide reliable and durable responses. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin versus conventional therapy for previously treated patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.<h4>Methods</h4>In this international, open-label, randomised, phase 3, multicentre trial, we enrolled adult patients with CD30-positive mycosis fungoides or primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma who had been previously treated. Patients were enrolled across 52 centres in 13 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally by an interactive voice and web response system to receive intravenous brentuximab vedotin 1·8 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, for up to 16 3-week cycles, or physician's choice (oral methotrexate 5-50 mg once per week or oral bexarotene 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once per day) for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in the intention-to-treat population achieving an objective global response lasting at least 4 months per independent review facility. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01578499.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Aug 13, 2012, and July 31, 2015, 131 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group (66 to brentuximab vedotin and 65 to physician's choice), with 128 analysed in the intention-to-treat population (64 in each group). At a median follow-up of 22·9 months (95% CI 18·4-26·1), the proportion of patients achieving an objective global response lasting at least 4 months was 56·3% (36 of 64 patients) with brentuximab vedotin versus 12·5% (eight of 64) with physician's choice, resulting in a between-group difference of 43·8% (95% CI 29·1-58·4; p<0·0001). Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 27 (41%) of 66 patients in the brentuximab vedotin group and 29 (47%) of 62 patients in the physician's choice group. Peripheral neuropathy was seen in 44 (67%) of 66 patients in the brentuximab vedotin group (n=21 grade 2, n=6 grade 3) and four (6%) of 62 patients in the physician's choice group. One of the four on-treatment deaths was deemed by the investigator to be treatment-related in the brentuximab vedotin group; no on-treatment deaths were reported in the physician's choice group.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Significant improvement in objective response lasting at least 4 months was seen with brentuximab vedotin versus physician's choice of methotrexate or bexarotene.<h4>Funding</h4>Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc (a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd), Seattle Genetics Inc.",

Incidence data (through 2017) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long-term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one-half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8% to 4.4% in women, and from 2.4% to 5% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2%-2.3%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For example, NSCLC 2-year relative survival increased from 34% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5% to 6% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14% to 15%. Improved treatment accelerated progress against lung cancer and drove a record drop in overall cancer mortality, despite slowing momentum for other common cancers.",

Based on the clinical impression of hepatocellular carcinoma, surgical resections were performed. Microscopic findings revealed that both lesions consisted of an aggregation of lymphocytes consisting of predominantly B-cells, with multiple lymphoid follicles positive for CD10 and negative for bcl-2, consistent with the diagnosis of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Polyclonality of both lesions was further confirmed by B cell receptor gene rearrangement study. The incidence of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in the liver is exceedingly rare, and it is difficult to differentiate such lesions from hepatic malignancies based upon clinical grounds.

However, the frequencies of specific mutations are significantly different between them, which implies they might determine specific disease phenotype. For instance, there are overrepresentations of mutations in RNA splicing factors or epigenetic regulators in MDS. We provide an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the biology of MDS and related disorders. Our focus is how mutations of in splicing factors or epigenetic regulators identified in MDS patients demonstrate phenotypes in knockin/knockout mouse models. For instance, mutant Srsf2 mice could alter Srsf2's normal sequence-specific RNA binding activity. It exhibited changing in the recognition of specific exonic splicing enhancer motifs to drive recurrent missplicing of Ezh2, which reduces Ezh2 expression by promoting nonsense-mediated decay. Consistent with this, SRSF2 mutations are mutually exclusive with EZH2 loss-of-function mutations in MDS patients. We also review how gene editing technology identified unique associations between pathogenic mechanisms and targeted therapy using lenalidomide, including: (i) how haploinsufficiency of the genes located in the commonly deleted region in del(5q) MDS patients promotes MDS; (ii) how lenalidomide causes selective elimination of del(5q) MDS cells; and (iii) why del(5q) MDS patients become resistant to lenalidomide. Thus, this review describes our current understanding of the mechanistic and biological effects of mutations in spliceosome and epigenetic regulators by comparing wild-type normal to mutant function as well as a brief overview of the recent progresses in MDS biology.",

Diagnosis is sometimes difficult and the clinical course exceedingly variable, as illustrated by this report of a girl, aged 2 years 4 months, with severe iron deficiency anaemia. There was no response to iron therapy and transfusions. Sustained and striking reticulocytosis associated with low haptoglobin mimicked haemolytic anaemia. Positive faecal blood test was documented after repeated testing. There were no pulmonary symptoms. A chest radiograph showed bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed numerous siderophages. High resolution computed tomography of the thorax revealed early pulmonary fibrotic changes. Recurrent reticulocytosis appeared to be a very useful sign of recurrent bleeding episodes.",

There are limited data on the epidemiology and best treatment practices for this malignancy. This study aimed to be the largest cohort with the most up-to-date analysis of the epidemiology of LCNEC.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried to identify cases of LCNEC diagnosed from 2010 through 2015, reflecting years the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition staging system was in use. Using these data, we compared the epidemiology, demographics, clinical characteristics, and survival times of LCNEC with small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-SCLC (NSCLC). Trends in incidence and mortality were recorded from 2004 to 2015.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 195,148 cases of lung cancer, including 1681 (0.9%) cases of LCNEC, were analyzed. LCNEC was more common among male subjects, and disease usually presented at stage IV (55%). Brain metastasis occurred more frequently in LCNEC (19.2%) than SCLC (16.7%, P < .001) or NSCLC (13%, P < .001). Incidence increased by 0.011 people per 100,000 per year, primarily of stage IV disease. Annual mortality from LCNEC doubled over the time period studied. Survival in patients with stage I-III LCNEC mirrored survival trends of patients with NSCLC, whereas stage IV LCNEC behaved similarly to SCLC.<h4>Conclusion</h4>LCNEC generally presents at more advanced stages than NSCLC but earlier than SCLC. Stage I-III LCNEC behaves similarly to NSCLC, whereas stage IV is more akin to SCLC. LCNEC incidence is increasing. Despite this, it remains poorly studied and did not demonstrate an improved prognosis in our cohort.",

It is thought that M. pneumoniae usually causes milder upper respiratory disease in preschool children, with a greater chance of pneumonia in school-age children. In this population-based cross-sectional study, we present evidence that severe M. pneumoniae infection is more common in preschool children than previously thought.<h4>Methods</h4>During an M. pneumoniae epidemic in our area, widespread health service and public awareness lead to extensive testing for M. pneumoniae. Medical records of hospital-referred M. pneumoniae-positive children were assessed retrospectively for respiratory disease and chest radiographic results. Severe disease was defined as supplementary oxygen or fluid requirement, mechanical ventilatory support or neurologic disease. Age-specific population figures were used to calculate incidence during the study period. Those who were 0-5-year-olds were considered preschool, whereas 6-17-year-olds were considered school-aged.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-seven preschool and 55 school-age children were referred to the hospital and tested positive for M. pneumoniae. Twenty-two (60%) preschool and 23 (42%) school-age children had severe disease [incidence 56 vs. 29 per 100,000; relative risk: 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-3.4; P = 0.03]. Twenty (54%) preschool and 19 (35%) school-age children had severe pneumonia (incidence 51 vs. 24 per 100,000; relative risk: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-3.9; P = 0.03).<h4>Conclusions</h4>During an M. pneumoniae epidemic in Akershus and North Oslo in 2011-2012, preschool children infected with M. pneumoniae had significantly higher risk of severe disease, particularly severe pneumonia, when compared with school-age children. M. pneumoniae should be considered a potential pathogen in younger children with respiratory distress, particularly during an epidemic period.",

The primary analysis tested the hypothesis that tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression would improve disease-free survival, as compared with tamoxifen alone. In the primary analysis, 46.7% of the patients had not received chemotherapy previously, and 53.3% had received chemotherapy and remained premenopausal.<h4>Results</h4>After a median follow-up of 67 months, the estimated disease-free survival rate at 5 years was 86.6% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group and 84.7% in the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio for disease recurrence, second invasive cancer, or death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 1.04; P=0.10). Multivariable allowance for prognostic factors suggested a greater treatment effect with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression than with tamoxifen alone (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.98). Most recurrences occurred in patients who had received prior chemotherapy, among whom the rate of freedom from breast cancer at 5 years was 82.5% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group and 78.0% in the tamoxifen group (hazard ratio for recurrence, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.02). At 5 years, the rate of freedom from breast cancer was 85.7% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group (hazard ratio for recurrence vs. tamoxifen, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.87).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Adding ovarian suppression to tamoxifen did not provide a significant benefit in the overall study population. However, for women who were at sufficient risk for recurrence to warrant adjuvant chemotherapy and who remained premenopausal, the addition of ovarian suppression improved disease outcomes. Further improvement was seen with the use of exemestane plus ovarian suppression. (Funded by Pfizer and others; SOFT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00066690.).",

The diagnosis of myocarditis was adjudicated by cardiologists using the case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We abstracted the presentation, clinical course, and outcome from the patient's electronic health record. We performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis of the incidence of myocarditis up to 42 days after the first vaccine dose.<h4>Results</h4>Among more than 2.5 million vaccinated HCO members who were 16 years of age or older, 54 cases met the criteria for myocarditis. The estimated incidence per 100,000 persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine was 2.13 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56 to 2.70). The highest incidence of myocarditis (10.69 cases per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 6.93 to 14.46) was reported in male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years. A total of 76% of cases of myocarditis were described as mild and 22% as intermediate; 1 case was associated with cardiogenic shock. After a median follow-up of 83 days after the onset of myocarditis, 1 patient had been readmitted to the hospital, and 1 had died of an unknown cause after discharge. Of 14 patients who had left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography during admission, 10 still had such dysfunction at the time of hospital discharge. Of these patients, 5 underwent subsequent testing that revealed normal heart function.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Among patients in a large Israeli health care system who had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the estimated incidence of myocarditis was 2.13 cases per 100,000 persons; the highest incidence was among male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years.

Age- and sex-adjusted projections were generated using US census data.<h4>Results</h4>During 2000-2013, the number of reported solid cancer cases increased 15%, melanoma cases increased 57%, and MCC cases increased 95%. In 2013, the MCC incidence rate was 0.7 cases/100,000 person-years in the United States, corresponding to 2488 cases/year. MCC incidence increased exponentially with age, from 0.1 to 1.0 to 9.8 (per 100,000 person-years) among age groups 40-44 years, 60-64 years, and ≥85 years, respectively. Due to aging of the Baby Boomer generation, US MCC incident cases are predicted to climb to 2835 cases/year in 2020 and 3284 cases/year in 2025.<h4>Limitations</h4>We assumed that the age-adjusted incidence rate would stabilize, and thus, the number of incident cases we projected might be an underestimate.<h4>Conclusion</h4>An aging population is driving brisk increases in the number of new MCC cases in the United States. This growing impact combined with the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape warrants expanded awareness of MCC diagnosis and management.",

Testing for aneuploidy and CNVs is routine during the investigation of fetal structural anomalies, but there is little information on the clinical usefulness of genome-wide next-generation sequencing in the prenatal setting. We therefore aimed to evaluate the proportion of fetuses with structural abnormalities that had identifiable variants in genes associated with developmental disorders when assessed with whole-exome sequencing (WES).<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective cohort study, two groups in Birmingham and London recruited patients from 34 fetal medicine units in England and Scotland. We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to evaluate the presence of genetic variants in developmental disorder genes (diagnostic genetic variants) in a cohort of fetuses with structural anomalies and samples from their parents, after exclusion of aneuploidy and large CNVs. Women were eligible for inclusion if they were undergoing invasive testing for identified nuchal translucency or structural anomalies in their fetus, as detected by ultrasound after 11 weeks of gestation. The partners of these women also had to consent to participate. Sequencing results were interpreted with a targeted virtual gene panel for developmental disorders that comprised 1628 genes. Genetic results related to fetal structural anomaly phenotypes were then validated and reported postnatally. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all fetuses, was the detection of diagnostic genetic variants considered to have caused the fetal developmental anomaly.<h4>Findings</h4>The cohort was recruited between Oct 22, 2014, and June 29, 2017, and clinical data were collected until March 31, 2018. After exclusion of fetuses with aneuploidy and CNVs, 610 fetuses with structural anomalies and 1202 matched parental samples (analysed as 596 fetus-parental trios, including two sets of twins, and 14 fetus-parent dyads) were analysed by WES. After bioinformatic filtering and prioritisation according to allele frequency and effect on protein and inheritance pattern, 321 genetic variants (representing 255 potential diagnoses) were selected as potentially pathogenic genetic variants (diagnostic genetic variants), and these variants were reviewed by a multidisciplinary clinical review panel. A diagnostic genetic variant was identified in 52 (8·5%; 95% CI 6·4-11·0) of 610 fetuses assessed and an additional 24 (3·9%) fetuses had a variant of uncertain significance that had potential clinical usefulness. Detection of diagnostic genetic variants enabled us to distinguish between syndromic and non-syndromic fetal anomalies (eg, congenital heart disease only vs a syndrome with congenital heart disease and learning disability). Diagnostic genetic variants were present in 22 (15·4%) of 143 fetuses with multisystem anomalies (ie, more than one fetal structural anomaly), nine (11·1%) of 81 fetuses with cardiac anomalies, and ten (15·4%) of 65 fetuses with skeletal anomalies; these phenotypes were most commonly associated with diagnostic variants. However, diagnostic genetic variants were least common in fetuses with isolated increased nuchal translucency (≥4·0 mm) in the first trimester (in three [3·2%] of 93 fetuses).<h4>Interpretation</h4>WES facilitates genetic diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies, which enables more accurate predictions of fetal prognosis and risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. However, the overall detection of diagnostic genetic variants in a prospectively ascertained cohort with a broad range of fetal structural anomalies is lower than that suggested by previous smaller-scale studies of fewer phenotypes. WES improved the identification of genetic disorders in fetuses with structural abnormalities; however, before clinical implementation, careful consideration should be given to case selection to maximise clinical usefulness.<h4>Funding</h4>UK Department of Health and Social Care and The Wellcome Trust.",http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673618319408/pdf

Multivariate analysis showed the significant risk factors for PAMM development to be younger age (mean age, 49 years in patients and 59 years in control participants; odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-0.99; P = 0.021) and female gender (66.7% of patients and 31.3% of control participants; OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.57-12.6; P = 0.005). The PAMM was distributed on either side of the causative arterioles. In 14 of the 18 eyes (78%), PAMM was located within a 3-mm diameter of the fovea. In 10 eyes (56%), PAMM measured 1 disc diameter or more, and in 5 eyes (28%), PAMM measured one third disc diameter or less. No emboli were found in any eyes; however, multiple segmental arterial constrictions were confirmed during vitrectomy in 1 eye. The BCVA decreased more than 2 lines in 2 eyes (5%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Paracentral acute middle maculopathy can develop after pars plana vitrectomy for PDR, especially in patients who are younger and female. Impaired blood flow in arterioles, which leads to tissue hypoxia, was associated with development of PAMM.",

Although immuno-thrombosis has been implicated in acute COVID-19 pathogenesis, the biological mechanisms underpinning long COVID remain unknown. We hypothesized that pulmonary microvascular immuno-thrombosis may be important in this context.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred fifty COVID-19 patients were reviewed at St James's Hospital Dublin between May and September 2020 at a median of 80.5 (range 44-155) days after initial diagnosis. These included patients hospitalized during initial illness (n = 69) and others managed entirely as out-patients (n = 81). Clinical examination, chest x-ray, and 6-min walk tests were performed. In addition, a range of coagulation and inflammatory markers were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Increased D-dimer levels (>500 ng/ml) were observed in 25.3% patients up to 4 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. On univariate analysis, elevated convalescent D-dimers were more common in COVID-19 patients who had required hospital admission and in patients aged more than 50 years (p < .001). Interestingly, we observed that 29% (n = 11) of patients with elevated convalescent D-dimers had been managed exclusively as out-patients during their illness. In contrast, other coagulation (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, platelet count) and inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and sCD25) markers had returned to normal in >90% of convalescent patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Elucidating the biological mechanisms responsible for sustained D-dimer increases may be of relevance in long COVID pathogenesis and has implications for clinical management of these patients.",http://www.jthjournal.org/article/S1538783622007371/pdf

It affects approximately 1-2% of the population and is linked to high rates of suicide, functional impairment and poorer quality of life. Presently, treatment options for BD are limited. There is a strong evidence base for pharmacological (e.g., lithium) and psychological (e.g., psychoeducation) treatments; however, both of these pose challenges for treatment outcomes (e.g., non-response, side-effects, limited access). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, is a recommended treatment for unipolar depression, but it is unclear whether rTMS is an effective, safe and well tolerated treatment in people with BD. This article reviews the extant literature on the use of rTMS to treat BD across different mood states. We found 34 studies in total (<i>N</i> = 611 patients), with most assessing bipolar depression (<i>n</i> = 26), <i>versus</i> bipolar mania (<i>n</i> = 5), mixed state bipolar (<i>n</i> = 2) or those not in a current affective episode (<i>n</i> = 1). Across all studies, there appears to be a detectable signal of efficacy for rTMS treatment, as most studies report that rTMS treatment reduced bipolar symptoms. Importantly, within the randomised controlled trial (RCT) study designs, most reported that rTMS was not superior to sham in the treatment of bipolar depression. However, these RCTs are based on small samples (<i>N</i>BD ⩽ 52). Reported side effects of rTMS in BD include headache, dizziness and sleep problems. Ten studies (<i>N</i> = 14 patients) reported cases of affective switching; however, no clear pattern of potential risk factors for affective switching emerged. Future adequately powered, sham-controlled trials are needed to establish the ideal rTMS treatment parameters to help better determine the efficacy of rTMS for the treatment of BD.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7682206?pdf=render

Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to naïve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection.<h4>Methods</h4>A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four naïve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two naïve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies.<h4>Results</h4>The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential. The study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices.",https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12985-016-0555-x

Cytokine elimination with continuous renal replacement therapies has been demonstrated in several clinical studies, but so far without important effects on their serum concentrations. Improved knowledge of the cytokine removal mechanisms could lead to the development of more efficient treatment strategies. In the present study, 15 patients with septic shock and acute renal failure were observed during the first 24 h of treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with an AN69 membrane. After 12 h, the hemofilter was replaced and the blood flow rate (QB) was switched from 100 ml/min to 200 ml/min or vice versa. Pre- and postfilter plasma and ultrafiltrate concentrations of selected inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured at several time points allowing the calculation of a mass balance. Cytokine removal was highest 1 h after the start of CVVH and after the change of the membrane (ranging from 25 to 43% of the prefilter amount), corresponding with a significant fall in the serum concentration of all cytokines. The inhibitors of inflammation were removed to the same extent as the inflammatory cytokines. Adsorption to the AN69 membrane appeared to be the main clearance mechanism, being most pronounced immediately after installation of a new membrane and decreasing steadily thereafter, indicating rapid saturation of the membrane. A QB of 200 ml/min was associated with a 75% increase of the ultrafiltration rate and a significantly higher convective elimination and membrane adsorption than at a QB of 100 ml/min. The results indicate that optimal cytokine removal with CVVH with an AN69 membrane could be achieved with a combination of a high QB/ultrafiltration rate and frequent membrane changes.",

A total of 154 eligible participants (age range, 18-65 years) with neck pain were randomly assigned to receive abdominal (n = 77) or non-penetrating sham abdominal (sham group; n = 77) acupuncture. Each participant was administered treatment over six sessions by Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners, in accordance with a standardized protocol. The primary outcome was mean improvement in neck pain disability scores evaluated by the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). Secondary outcomes included intensity of neck pain and health-related quality-of-life measures. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2 and 6 weeks from baseline. Patients in the abdominal acupuncture group received additional follow-up evaluation at 14 weeks from baseline. Outcomes were evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis.<h4>Results</h4>All participants provided informed consent for treatment and follow-up evaluation. Patients who received abdominal acupuncture exhibited greater improvement in NPQ scores than those who received sham treatment at both 2 and 6 weeks from baseline (intergroup mean differences, -5.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.48 to -2.03; P = 0.008 and -8.65; 95% CI, -12.13 to -5.16; P < 0.001, respectively). The improvement in NPQ scores in the abdominal acupuncture group was even more significant at 14 weeks from baseline. Patients in the abdominal acupuncture group also exhibited significantly greater improvements in intensity of neck pain and a few quality-of-life measures than those in the sham abdominal acupuncture group, without any serious adverse events.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that abdominal acupuncture is an effective alternative treatment for neck pain.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-TRC-14004932.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181360&type=printable

We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS.<h4>Methods</h4>In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality.

Lesions were classified as type 1 or 2 in relation to the SD-OCT location of the lesion above (type 1) or below (type 2) the outer plexiform layer (OPL) at 6 tertiary referral centers.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 9 patients, 5 were female and 4 were male (mean age, 47.6 years; range, 21-65 years). All patients presented with an acute paracentral scotoma and demonstrated a classic dark gray paracentral lesion with near-infrared imaging. Visual acuity ranged from 20/15 to 20/30. Six eyes (5 patients) had type 1 SD-OCT lesions, also referred to as paracentral acute middle maculopathy, and 5 eyes (4 patients) had type 2 SD-OCT lesions. Although type 1 lesions lead to inner nuclear layer (INL) thinning, type 2 lesions resulted in ONL thinning. Type 2 lesions were always associated with significant outer macular defects, including disruption of the inner segment/outer segment and outer segment/retinal pigment epithelium bands, whereas type 1 lesions spared the outer macula.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Paracentral acute middle maculopathy may represent a novel variant of AMN that affects the middle layers of the macula above the OPL as diagnosed with SD-OCT imaging. Two types of AMN lesions may be seen with SD-OCT occurring above and below the OPL. Type 1 refers to hyperreflective bands in the OPL/INL region with subsequent INL thinning. Type 2 is hyperreflective bands in the OPL/ONL region with subsequent ONL thinning. Type 2 lesions may be associated with concomitant defects of the inner segment/outer segment layer. We propose that each of these lesions may be explained by occlusion of either the superficial capillary plexus (type 1) or deep capillary plexus (type 2) located in the innermost and outermost portion of the INL, respectively, immediately adjacent to each corresponding lesion type.",

In this study, we extend this work to an independent sample studied at various stages of illness and treatment (mild symptoms, on average) to determine if these deficits in past suicide attempters are evident during a less severe clinical state.<h4>Method</h4>A total of 80 individuals with a past history of major depression and suicide attempt were compared with 81 individuals with a history of major depression and no lifetime suicide attempts on a battery of neurocognitive measures assessing attention, memory, abstract/contingent learning, working memory, language fluency and impulse control.<h4>Results</h4>Past attempters performed more poorly in attention, memory and working memory domains, but also in an estimate of pre-morbid intelligence. After correction for this estimate, tests that had previously distinguished past attempters - a computerized Stroop task and the Buschke Selective Reminding Test - remained significantly worse in attempters. In a secondary analysis, similar differences were found among those with the lowest levels of depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score <10), suggesting that these deficits may be trait markers independent of current symptomatology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Deficits in interference processing and learning/memory constitute an enduring defect in information processing that may contribute to poor adaptation, other higher-order cognitive impairments and risk for suicidal behavior.",

Initially, exons 14 and 15 of the SF3B1 gene were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Secondly, they were studied by NGS covering besides SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and ZRSR2 genes. An 86% of all patients showed mutations in the SF3B1 gene. Six of them, which were not identifiable by conventional sequencing in the first diagnostic step, were revealed by NGS. In addition, 19.5% of cases showed mutations in other splicing genes: SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2. Furthermore, 8.7% of patients had two mutations in SF3B1, SF3B1 and SRSF2, and SF3B1 and U2AF1, while 5.7% showed no mutations in the four spliceosome-related genes analyzed. The combined use of conventional Sanger and NGS allows the identification of mutations in spliceosome-related genes in almost all MDS patients with RS. This two-step approach is affordable and could be useful as a complementary technique in cases with an unclear diagnosis.",

Presence of liver injury was commonly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, reports on severe liver dysfunction (SLD) in critically ill with COVID-19 are lacking. We evaluated the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcome of SLD in critically ill patients with COVID-19.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical course and laboratory was analyzed from all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICU of the university hospital. SLD was defined as: bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dl or elevation of aminotransferase levels (> 20-fold ULN).<h4>Results</h4>72 critically ill patients were identified, 22 (31%) patients developed SLD. Presenting characteristics including age, gender, comorbidities as well as clinical presentation regarding COVID-19 overlapped substantially in both groups. Patients with SLD had more severe respiratory failure (paO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2:</sub> 82 (58-114) vs. 117 (83-155); p < 0.05). Thus, required more frequently mechanical ventilation (95% vs. 64%; p < 0.01), rescue therapies (ECMO) (27% vs. 12%; p = 0.106), vasopressor (95% vs. 72%; p < 0.05) and renal replacement therapy (86% vs. 30%; p < 0.001).

ICIs have been shown to provide significant mortality benefits for cancer patients, but they are also associated with immune-mediated toxicity. Unlike most immune-related adverse events, which are a common occurrence, reversible and can be treated effectively with glucocorticoid therapy, ICI-associated cardiotoxicities are uncommon, with serious complications and a relatively high mortality even when treated with glucocorticoids. ICI-associated cardiotoxicity can manifest in various ways, including myocarditis, arrhythmias and conduction disease, pericardial disease, myocardial infarction, non-inflammatory cardiomyocyte dysfunction, and even Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy. The present review summarizes the current understanding of ICI-associated cardiotoxicities, examining the epidemiology and timing of onset, as well as their clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, pathophysiology, clinical management and outcomes. Although the literature describing ICI-associated cardiotoxicity remains limited to case reports, case series and early clinical trials, strategies for the surveillance, diagnosis and management of this potentially fatal cardiovascular complication of cancer therapy have been proposed.",

Various therapeutic approaches and results in 148 cases.,,"Goto K, Hieshima GB, Higashida RT, Halbach VV, Bentson JR, Mehringer CM, Pribram HF.",1986,Acta radiologica. Supplementum,"From 1974 to 1986, 148 patients with carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) were evaluated for intravascular therapy. Four patients died from hemorrhage before treatment could be instituted and the CCF closed spontaneously in 5. Therapeutic approaches which resulted in complete occlusion in the remaining 139 cases were transarterial in 118, transvenous in 15 and external compression of the carotid artery and jugular vein in 6. The current treatment of choice of the direct CCF is intravascular embolization using detachable balloons, particulate emboli or liquid adhesive agents to occlude the CCF while attempting to preserve the carotid artery. In 15 patients it was technically too difficult to use the transarterial approach. The patients were therefore treated from a transvenous approach including access via the femoral vein, superior ophthalmic vein, intraoperatively from the inferior petrosal sinus or direct puncture of the cavernous sinus. Embolic agents used included detachable silicone balloons, steel minicoils, particulate emboli and isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate. In 14 of these 15 patients total obliteration was achieved with marked improvement in symptoms. Complications occurred in 3 patients including perforation of the cavernous sinus resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage, delayed pontine hemorrhage from subtotal occlusion of the fistula and transient increased proptosis.",

Due to the different specialities involved in the treatment and the heterogenous presentation of the disease, therapeutic standard is still controversial. This study analyzes treatment and outcome in these patients based on a large retrospective review and proposes a therapeutic algorithm.<h4>Methods</h4>The cases of 218 adult patients treated with deep neck abscesses over a 10-year period at a tertiary university hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical, radiological, microbiological and laboratory findings were compared between patients with and without mediastinal involvement.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-five patients (20.64%) presented with abscess formation descending into the mediastinum. Those patients had significantly (all items p < 0.0001) higher rates of surgical interventions (4.27 vs. 1.11) and tracheotomies (82% vs. 3.4%), higher markers of inflammation (CRP 26.09 vs. 10.41 mg/dl), required more CT-scans (3.58 vs. 0.85), longer hospitalization (39.78 vs 9.79 days) and more frequently needed a change in antibiotic therapy (44.44% vs. 6.40%). Multi-resistant pathogens were found in 6.67% vs. 1.16%. Overall mortality rate was low with 1.83%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite of the high percentage of mediastinal involvement in the present patient collective, the proposed therapeutic algorithm resulted in a low mortality rate. Frequent CT-scans, regular planned surgical revisions with local drainage and lavage, as well as an early tracheotomy seem to be most beneficial regarding the outcome.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00405-021-06945-9.pdf

The troponin concentration can be thought of as a quantitative measure of the degree of injury sustained by the heart, however, it provides no information on the cause of injury or the mechanism of troponin release. Conventionally, the cardiac troponins have been used for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in humans and have become the gold standard biomarkers for this indication. They have become increasingly recognized as an objective measure of cardiomyocyte status in both cardiac and noncardiac disease, supplying additional information to that provided by echocardiography and ECG. Injury to cardiomyocytes can occur through a variety of mechanisms with subsequent release of troponins. Independent of the underlying disease or the mechanism of troponin release, the presence of myocardial injury is associated with an increased risk of death. As increasingly sensitive assays are introduced, the frequent occurrence of myocardial injury is becoming apparent, and our understanding of its causes and importance is constantly evolving. Presently troponins are valuable for detecting a subgroup of patients with higher risk of death. Future research is needed to clarify whether troponins can serve as monitoring tools guiding treatment, whether administering more aggressive treatment to patients with evidence of myocardial injury is beneficial, and whether normalizing of troponin concentrations in patients presenting with evidence of myocardial injury is associated with reduced risk of death.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jvim.13801

B, Infectious diseases and veterinary public health","Several data from different authors show that Bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) could be a key component in multiple-etiology diseases, indeed a lower leukocytes number and their impaired functions decrease the resistance to infections. However, most of the information on the impairment of immune function during BVDV infections arise from circumstantial evidence and from experimental infection studies, and few from field data. To assess the effects of BVDV on blood cells parameters, cellular and humoral functions under field conditions, we designed a controlled study in commercial dairy herds, comparing persistent infected (PI) and healthy heifers. A total of 45 heifers were considered, the PI animals were nine, the control animals were 34, while two controls were considered as acute infected animals. The comparison of the mean values in PI calves showed a significant decrease for leukocytes and granulocytes, while platelets showed a significant increase, when compared with control animals. The total number of lymphocytes decreased not significantly in PI animals, while the proportion significantly increased. The number and proportion of monocytes was significantly reduced in PI animals, when compared with controls. The data collected on markers of cellular immunity during our study cannot be compared with the literature because there are no reference values. The presence of a persistent infection affected the cellular enzymes: NAGase, lysozyme and respiratory burst showed a large statistically significant decrease in PI animals when compared with controls. The presence of a persistent infection with BVD virus influenced blood cells number and impaired some blood cell functions. Such impairment confirms that PI animals represent a threat to the herd not only because they could spread BVDV, but also because they are more susceptible to other infectious diseases.",

In individuals with major depression, several studies have demonstrated an alteration of affective prosody. The aim of this study is to identify prosodic markers that may be predictive of PSD.<h4>Methods</h4>Patient voices were recorded at baseline and 3 months after stroke. We extracted prosodic parameters, including fundamental frequency, percentage of voice breaks, and shimmer. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed 3 months later.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 49 patients included in the study, 22.5% developed PSD 3 months after stroke. A significant decrease was observed concerning the fundamental frequency among patients who developed PSD. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that initial voice breaks coupled with shimmer are strongly predictive of subsequent PSD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Early alterations of affective prosody are associated with a higher risk of PSD 3 months after a stroke. This new physiological approach overcomes traditional barriers associated with clinical instruments and contributes to the prediction of this disorder.",

Three patients presented with apoplexy and 6 with subclinical apoplexy. Duration of symptoms ranged from 3 days to 1 year. MRI revealed hemorrhage (9/9), rim enhancement (6/9), sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening (2/9), mass effect on the optic chiasm (8/9), and sellar remodeling (9/9). The percentage of hemorrhage preoperatively observed on MRI ranged from 50% to greater than 95%. On presentation, hyperprolactinemia was recorded in 7 patients, 6 of whom had galactorrhea and/or amenorrhea. Open transsphenoidal decompression was performed in 8/9 patients; 7 of 9 were diagnosed with prolactinoma. Biopsy specimens revealed 10%-90% hemorrhage and no infarction in any of the cases. All patients treated showed improvement of symptoms after surgery (average follow-up, 28.2 months). Postoperative complications included transient diabetes insipidus (n = 5), persistent cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (n = 3), and meningitis (n = 1). Five patients had long-term endocrine sequelae of hyperprolactinemia requiring ongoing medical treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Pituitary hemorrhage resulting in apoplexy or subclinical apoplexy in adolescents may represent a distinct entity with a more indolent symptomatology and more favorable neurologic and endocrine outcome compared with adults that is worthy of further validation in a multi-institutional cohort.",

Management of the pandemic will rely heavily on the degree of adaptive immunity persistence following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Along with the progression of the pandemic, more literature on the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response is becoming available. Here, we summarize findings on the persistence of the humoral, including neutralizing antibody, response at three to eight months post SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-pregnant adults. While the comparability of the literature is limited, findings on the detectability of immunoglobulin G class of antibodies (IgG) were most consistent and were reported in most studies to last for six to eight months. Studies investigating the response of immunoglobins M and A (IgM, IgA) were limited and reported mixed results, in particular, for IgM. The majority of studies observed neutralizing antibodies at all time points tested, which in some studies lasted up to eight months. The presence of neutralizing antibodies has been linked to protection from re-infection, suggesting long-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These neutralizing capacities may be challenged by emerging virus variants, but mucosal antibodies as well as memory B and T cells may optimize future immune responses. Thus, further longitudinal investigation of PCR-confirmed seropositive individuals using sensitive assays is warranted to elucidate the nature and duration of a more long-term humoral response.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8420449?pdf=render

Because the risk of stroke is maximum within the first few days after the onset of visual loss, prompt diagnosis and triage are mandatory. Eye care professionals must make a rapid and accurate diagnosis and recognize the need for timely expert intervention by immediately referring patients with acute retinal arterial ischemia to specialized stroke centers without attempting to perform any further testing themselves.

We aimed to evaluate overall and variant-specific effectiveness of BNT162b2 (tozinameran, Pfizer-BioNTech) against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions by time since vaccination among members of a large US health-care system.<h4>Methods</h4>In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed electronic health records of individuals (≥12 years) who were members of the health-care organisation Kaiser Permanente Southern California (CA, USA), to assess BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions for up to 6 months. Participants were required to have 1 year or more previous membership of the organisation. Outcomes comprised SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests and COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Effectiveness calculations were based on hazard ratios from adjusted Cox models. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04848584.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Dec 14, 2020, and Aug 8, 2021, of 4 920 549 individuals assessed for eligibility, we included 3 436 957 (median age 45 years [IQR 29-61]; 1 799 395 [52·4%] female and 1 637 394 [47·6%] male). For fully vaccinated individuals, effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 73% (95% CI 72-74) and against COVID-19-related hospital admissions was 90% (89-92). Effectiveness against infections declined from 88% (95% CI 86-89) during the first month after full vaccination to 47% (43-51) after 5 months. Among sequenced infections, vaccine effectiveness against infections of the delta variant was high during the first month after full vaccination (93% [95% CI 85-97]) but declined to 53% [39-65] after 4 months. Effectiveness against other (non-delta) variants the first month after full vaccination was also high at 97% (95% CI 95-99), but waned to 67% (45-80) at 4-5 months. Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall (93% [95% CI 84-96]) up to 6 months.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Our results provide support for high effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admissions up until around 6 months after being fully vaccinated, even in the face of widespread dissemination of the delta variant. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections over time is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection.<h4>Funding</h4>Pfizer.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8489881?pdf=render

Retrospective analyses have suggested that there may be an interaction between these drugs, with higher circulating vasopressin levels and improved outcomes in patients treated with both vasopressin and corticosteroids. We aimed to test for an interaction between vasopressin and corticosteroids in septic shock.<h4>Design</h4>Prospective open-label randomized controlled pilot trial.<h4>Setting</h4>Four adult ICUs in London teaching hospitals.<h4>Patients</h4>Sixty-one adult patients who had septic shock.<h4>Interventions</h4>Initial vasopressin IV infusion titrated up to 0.06 U/min and then IV hydrocortisone (50 mg 6 hourly) or placebo. Plasma vasopressin levels were measured at 6-12 and 24-36 hours after hydrocortisone/placebo administration.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Thirty-one patients were allocated to vasopressin + hydrocortisone and 30 patients to vasopressin + placebo. The hydrocortisone group required a shorter duration of vasopressin therapy (3.1 d; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1; shorter in hydrocortisone group) and required a lower total dose of vasopressin (ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32-0.71) compared with the placebo group. Plasma vasopressin levels were not higher in the hydrocortisone group compared with the placebo group (64 pmol/L difference at 6- to 12-hour time point; 95% CI, -32 to 160 pmol/L). Early vasopressin use was well tolerated with only one serious adverse event possibly related to study drug administration reported. There were no differences in mortality rates (23% 28-day mortality in both groups) or organ failure assessments between the two treatment groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Hydrocortisone spared vasopressin requirements, reduced duration, and reduced dose, when used together in the treatment of septic shock, but it did not alter plasma vasopressin levels. Further trials are needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of vasopressin as the initial vasopressor therapy with or without corticosteroids.",

However, the frequency of FNs and patient characteristics associated with FNs are poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively reviewed test results from 15 011 adults who underwent ≥1 SARS-CoV-2 NAATs; 2699 had an initial negative NAAT and repeat testing. We defined FNs as ≥1 negative NAATs followed by a positive NAAT within 14 days during the same episode of illness. We stratified subjects with FNs by duration of symptoms before the initial FN test (≤5 days versus >5 days) and examined their clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty of 2699 subjects (2.2%) had a FN result during the study period. The weekly frequency of FNs among subjects with repeat testing peaked at 4.4%, coinciding with peak NAAT positivity (38%). Most subjects with FNs had symptoms (52 of 60; 87%) and chest radiography (19 of 32; 59%) consistent with COVID-19. Of the FN NAATs, 18 of 60 (30%) were performed early (ie, ≤1 day of symptom onset), and 18 of 60 (30%) were performed late (ie, >7 days after symptom onset) in disease. Among 17 subjects with 2 consecutive FNs on NP NAATs, 9 (53%) provided lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens for testing, all of which were positive.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings support repeated NAATs among symptomatic patients, particularly during periods of higher COVID-19 incidence. The LRT testing should be prioritized to increase yield among patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19.",https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-pdf/8/1/ofaa559/38547580/ofaa559.pdf

WT1(A) and (B) bound equally well to the Egr-1/WT1-binding site, but WT1(B), which contains a 17 amino acid insertion compared to WT1(A), was a consistently stronger activator of transcription than WT1(A). Transcriptional activation by wild-type WT1 was inhibited by coexpression of WT(PM) or WT(AR), genetically defined dominant negative alleles of WT1.

However, most of them involve tumors of difference sizes, radiation dosages, and surgical approaches. Few have systematically compared issues of dysequilibrium. By studying only patients with small tumors and no hearing, we sought to minimize confounding variables.<h4>Study design</h4>A retrospective chart review and telephone questionnaire.<h4>Methods</h4>From 1998-2006, 31 patients with small (<1.5 cm) VS and nonserviceable hearing (American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery [AAO-HNS] Class C or D) were treated at our institution. Twenty-two were available for follow-up and telephone questionnaire, including the University of California Los Angeles Dizziness Questionnaire (UCLA-DQ). Twelve underwent SRS and 10 underwent MS. All MS patients underwent the translabyrinthine approach to their tumors. Outcomes measurements included tumor control, facial nerve function, tinnitus, trigeminal function, and imbalance.<h4>Results</h4>Patients undergoing SRS had comparable rates of tumor control, facial nerve function, tinnitus, and trigeminal function to MS patients. However, SRS did result in statistically significantly worse long-term imbalance when compared with MS patients. Detailed comparisons of the two modalities are made.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In our study population, patients with small tumors and no serviceable hearing, these data suggest that MS results in comparable minimal morbidity with SRS, though posttreatment dysequilibrium is significantly decreased. While the authors recommend translabyrinthine resection of small VS with no hearing in patients able to tolerate surgery, the need for further prospective investigation is clear.",

Venous and lymphatic disorders,"<h4>Objective</h4>Minimally invasive interventions by recanalization, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and stenting in post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) obstructions and iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS) have shown good results. Until recently, no dedicated venous stents were available, and stent-related issues accounted for a decrease in patency scores. The introduction of dedicated stents with more flexibility and higher radial forces could result in higher patency scores. This study focused on the outcomes of patients treated by a dedicated sinus-Venous stent (OptiMed GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). Patency rates and clinical evaluation are described for both PTS and IVCS patients.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 200 patients treated at a tertiary university referral center were analyzed. A percutaneous procedure was performed in 103 (51%) PTS patients and 48 (24%) IVCS patients. In 49 (25%) patients, a hybrid procedure was executed. Patency rates and complications were analyzed by duplex ultrasound. Clinical improvement was scored by Venous Clinical Severity Score, Villalta scale, and venous claudication rates.<h4>Results</h4>The mean age was 43.2 ± 14.5 (17-81) years, and 66% were female. Mean Villalta score decreased from 10.5 ± 4.2 (3-24) to 5.3 ± 3.8 (0-14) at the latest follow-up (P < .001). Venous Clinical Severity Score decreased by a total of 3 points (P < .001). At baseline, venous claudication was present in 132 patients, which subsided in 115 (87%). Overall patency scores revealed a primary patency of 68%, assisted primary patency of 83%, and secondary patency of 90% with a median follow-up of 12 (11-12) months. Of all included patients, 122 (61%) did not have a complication during follow-up; the most frequent complications were in-stent restenosis (n = 23) and occlusion (n = 25) of the stented tract.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Short-term clinical results using the sinus-Venous stent are comparable to previous research. Loss of stent patency due to stent-related issues like kinking or tapering is hardly ever seen in this short-term follow-up.",

A cohort from the northern European population with its known high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency therefore would be ideal to answer the latter question. We examined 675 iliac crest biopsies from male and female individuals, excluding all patients who showed any signs of secondary bone diseases at autopsy. Structural histomorphometric parameters, including osteoid indices, were quantified using the Osteomeasure System according to ASBMR standards, and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured for all patients. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. The histologic results demonstrate an unexpected high prevalence of mineralization defects, that is, a pathologic increase in osteoid. Indeed, 36.15% of the analyzed patients presented with an osteoid surface per bone surface (OS/BS) of more than 20%. Based on the most conservative threshold that defines osteomalacia at the histomorphometric level with a pathologic increase in osteoid volume per bone volume (OV/BV) greater than 2% manifest mineralization defects were present in 25.63% of the patients. The latter were found independent of bone volume per trabecular volume (BV/TV) throughout all ages and affected both sexes equally. While we could not establish a minimum 25(OH)D level that was inevitably associated with mineralization defects, we did not find pathologic accumulation of osteoid in any patient with circulating 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L. Our data demonstrate that pathologic mineralization defects of bone occur in patients with a serum 25(OH)D below 75 nmol/L and strongly argue that in conjunction with a sufficient calcium intake, the dose of vitamin D supplementation should ensure that circulating levels of 25(OH)D reach this minimum threshold (75 nmol/L or 30 ng/mL) to maintain skeletal health.",

Most findings were reported in the form of case reports or case series, whereas a comprehensive overview is still lacking. We conducted a systematic review and searched for all published cases until July 20th 2020. We included 73 patients reported in 52 publications. A broad age range was affected (mean 55, min 11-max 94 years) with male predominance (68.5%). Most patients showed respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, and developed GBS manifestations after COVID-19. However, asymptomatic cases for COVID-19 were also described. The distributions of clinical variants and electrophysiological subtypes resemble those of classic GBS, with a higher prevalence of the classic sensorimotor form and the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, although rare variants like Miller Fisher syndrome were also reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytological dissociation was present in around 71% cases, and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all tested cases. More than 70% of patients showed a good prognosis, mostly after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Patients with less favorable outcome were associated with a significantly older age in accordance with previous findings regarding both classic GBS and COVID-19. COVID-19-associated GBS seems to share most features of classic post-infectious GBS and possibly the same immune-mediated pathogenetic mechanisms.

For both disorders, linkage studies have implicated titin as a potential candidate gene.<h4>Methods</h4>The authors analyzed major candidate regions in the titin gene by sequencing and Southern blot hybridization, and performed titin immunohistochemistry on TMD patient material to identify the underlying mutation. Western blot studies were performed on the known titin ligands in muscle samples of both disorders and controls, and analysis of apoptosis was also performed.<h4>Results</h4>The authors identified almost complete loss of calpain3, a ligand of titin, in the patient with limb-girdle MD (LGMD) with a homozygous state of TMD haplotype when primary calpain3 gene defect was excluded. Apoptotic myonuclei with altered distribution of transcription factor NF-kB and its inhibitor IkBalpha were encountered in muscle samples of patients with either heterozygous or homozygous TMD haplotype. Similar findings were confirmed in the MDM mouse.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results imply that titin mutations may be responsible for TMD, and that the pathophysiologic pathway following calpain3 deficiency may overlap with LGMD2A. The loss of calpain3 could be a downstream effect of the deficient TMD gene product. The significance of the secondary calpain3 defect for the pathogenesis of TMD was emphasized by similar calpain3 deficiency in the MDM mouse, which is suggested to be a mouse model for TMD. Homozygous mutation at the 2q locus may thus be capable of producing yet another LGMD.",

However, the long-term impact of the condition is underrecognized with a high burden of morbidity for the patient, especially in adulthood. IVCA has been shown to be an independent risk factor for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with a high risk of recurrence. The acronym KILT for kidney and inferior vena cava anomaly with leg thrombosis summarizes the pathological situation.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We present the case of a 40-year-old patient with pain in the right lower limb resulting from acute thrombophlebitis. No risk factors could be identified. His history was remarkable with two episodes of deep venous thrombosis first of the left, then the right leg 22 years earlier; at that time also, no risk factor was identified. Because of the idiopathic character of that thrombosis, the patient remained on long-term anticoagulation with phenprocoumon. The present thrombophlebitis occurred while the INR was not therapeutic in the preceding weeks. A CT with contrast showed atresia of the inferior vena cava and of the right kidney, and presence of numerous collaterals. A thorough medical history revealed a renal vein thrombosis as a neonate. Anticoagulation was intensified, and stent placement became necessary after a further 2 years.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>KILT syndrome is a rare but underrecognized condition. Complications may arise in young adulthood only, and it is of prime importance to instruct parents of the pediatric patient of the possible consequences of renal vein thrombosis and to assure guidance from the treating physicians throughout adulthood. Diagnosis of IVCA is by CT with contrast or by MRI, and lifelong anticoagulation may be necessary. Since the KILT syndrome is widely underdiagnosed, we challenge the clinicians to keep it in mind when confronted with thrombophlebitis or thrombosis of the young, male and with no other identifiable risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.",https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12887-019-1567-7

PEM are characterized by an intradermal population of heavily pigmented epithelioid-shaped melanocytes along with some spindled and dendritic melanocytes with frequent melanophages. These melanocytic tumors occasionally involve regional lymph nodes but only rarely result in distant metastases. Recent studies have demonstrated a variable but limited number of specific genomic aberrations including protein kinase A regulatory subunit alpha (PRKAR1A), BRAF, GNAQ, and MAP2K1 mutations as well as protein kinase C alpha isoform (PRKCA) fusions. We performed an 8-year retrospective review of our database and identified 16 cases of PEM. Using targeted DNA sequencing and RNA-seq to assess 1714 cancer-related genes, we detected gene fusions involving PRKCA in 31% of cases (5/16) with 5' partners SCARB1(12q24) in 2 cases, CD63 (12q13) in 1 case, ATP2B4 (1q32) in 1 case, and MAP3K3 (17q23) in 1 case. Additional fusions were identified in TPR-NTRK1 (1/16), ALK (1/16), and MYO5A-NTRK3 (1/16). PRKCA fusion lesions tended to occur in younger-aged patients and histologic examination demonstrated sheets of monomorphic epithelioid-shaped melanocytes, moderate to high-grade nuclear atypia, and higher mitotic activity (P=0.037). Our gene panel also identified previously described mutations in PRKAR1A, GNAQ, MAP2K1, BRAF, NF1. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive study of PEM integrating molecular data with histologic features that can be utilized in future studies for improved subclassification and prognostication of heavily pigmented melanocytic neoplasms.",

The Y chromosome-linked gene sex-determining region Y (SRY) is believed to be the master initiator of male sex determination in almost all eutherian and metatherian mammals, functioning to upregulate expression of its direct target gene Sry-related HMG box-containing gene 9 (SOX9). Data suggest that SRY evolved from SOX3, although there is no direct functional evidence to support this hypothesis. Indeed, loss-of-function mutations in SOX3 do not affect sex determination in mice or humans. To further investigate Sox3 function in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing Sox3. Here, we report that in one of these transgenic lines, Sox3 was ectopically expressed in the bipotential gonad and that this led to frequent complete XX male sex reversal. Further analysis indicated that Sox3 induced testis differentiation in this particular line of mice by upregulating expression of Sox9 via a similar mechanism to Sry. Importantly, we also identified genomic rearrangements within the SOX3 regulatory region in three patients with XX male sex reversal. Together, these data suggest that SOX3 and SRY are functionally interchangeable in sex determination and support the notion that SRY evolved from SOX3 via a regulatory mutation that led to its de novo expression in the early gonad.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the oncological and functional outcomes which underwent cementation or bone grafting after GCT curettage around the knee.<h4>Methods</h4>We reported 136 cases with GCTs in distal femur or proximal tibia who accepted curettage from five clinical centers during the last 15 years. All patients were divided into two groups according to filling materials. Recurrence-free survival proportions were used to evaluate oncological outcomes while the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) 93 functional score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. Other parameters including surgical complication, general condition, and radiological classification had been analyzed. The valid statisitical data was analyzed using SPSS 13.0 software.<h4>Results</h4>After GCT curettage, 86 patients (63.2%) accepted bone grafting while 50 patients (36.8%) accepted cementation. There was no statistical difference in age, gender, tumor location, radiological classification, fixation, follow-up time, and MSTS 93 functional score between cementation group and bone grafting group. The recurrence-free survival proportions showed that the recurrence rate in bone grafting group was higher than it in cementation group (P = 0.034). Surgical complication was lower in cementation group than that in bone grafting group but without statistically significant difference (P = 0.141).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Parameters including patients' age, gender, tumor location, and radiological classification did not affect surgeons' treatments in cavity filling after GCT curettage. Cementation should be recommended because of easy usage, the similar postoperative knee function with bone grafting, and the better local tumor control than bone grafting.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5678251?pdf=render

Pharmacological therapy is frequently required for acutely treating migraine attacks. The American Academy of Neurology Guidelines published in 2000 summarized the available evidence relating to the efficacy of acute migraine medications. This review, conducted by the members of the Guidelines Section of the American Headache Society, is an updated assessment of evidence for the migraine acute medications. A standardized literature search was performed to identify articles related to acute migraine treatment that were published between 1998 and 2013. The American Academy of Neurology Guidelines Development procedures were followed. Two authors reviewed each abstract resulting from the search and determined whether the full manuscript qualified for review. Two reviewers studied each qualifying full manuscript for its level of evidence. Level A evidence requires at least 2 Class I studies, and Level B evidence requires 1 Class I or 2 Class II studies. The specific medications - triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan [oral, nasal spray, injectable, transcutaneous patch], zolmitriptan [oral and nasal spray]) and dihydroergotamine (nasal spray, inhaler) are effective (Level A). Ergotamine and other forms of dihydroergotamine are probably effective (Level B). Effective nonspecific medications include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen), opioids (butorphanol nasal spray), sumatriptan/naproxen, and the combination of acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine (Level A). Ketoprofen, intravenous and intramuscular ketorolac, flurbiprofen, intravenous magnesium (in migraine with aura), and the combination of isometheptene compounds, codeine/acetaminophen and tramadol/acetaminophen are probably effective (Level B). The antiemetics prochlorperazine, droperidol, chlorpromazine, and metoclopramide are probably effective (Level B). There is inadequate evidence for butalbital and butalbital combinations, phenazone, intravenous tramadol, methadone, butorphanol or meperidine injections, intranasal lidocaine, and corticosteroids, including dexamethasone (Level C). Octreotide is probably not effective (Level B). There is inadequate evidence to refute the efficacy of ketorolac nasal spray, intravenous acetaminophen, chlorpromazine injection, and intravenous granisetron (Level C). There are many acute migraine treatments for which evidence supports efficacy. Clinicians must consider medication efficacy, potential side effects, and potential medication-related adverse events when prescribing acute medications for migraine. Although opioids, such as butorphanol, codeine/acetaminophen, and tramadol/acetaminophen, are probably effective, they are not recommended for regular use.",

We evaluated the effect of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on serum ammonia level and outcomes in ALF. This was a multicenter cohort study of consecutive ALF patients from the United States ALF Study Group registry between January 1998 and December 2016. First, we studied the association of ammonia with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and 21-day transplant-free survival (TFS; n = 1,186). Second, we studied the effect of RRT on ammonia for the first 3 days post study admission (n = 340) and on 21-day TFS (n = 1,186). Higher admission (n = 1,186) median ammonia level was associated with grade 3-4 HE (116 vs. 83 μmol/L) and mortality at day 21 attributed to neurological (181 vs. 90 μmol/L) and all causes (114 vs. 83 μmol/L; P < 0.001 for all). Among 340 patients with serial ammonia levels, 61 (18%) were on continuous RRT (CRRT), 59 (17%) were on intermittent RRT (IRRT), and 220 (65%) received no RRT for the first 2 days. From days 1 to 3, median ammonia decreased by 38%, 23%, and 19% with CRRT, IRRT, and no RRT, respectively. Comparing to no RRT use, whereas ammonia reduction with CRRT was significant (P = 0.007), with IRRT it was not (P = 0.75). After adjusting for year of enrollment, age, etiology, and disease severity, whereas CRRT (odds ratio [OR], 0.47 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.26-0.82]) was associated with reduction in 21-day transplant-free all-cause mortality, IRRT (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.04-2.72]) was associated with an increase.

The body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower (13.5 vs. 17.3, p=0.011), and the duration since the onset of AN was shorter (4.2 years vs. 8.9 years, p=0.037) in patients with elevated ALT. The age was younger in patients with elevated ALT, even though not significant (24.5 vs. 29.8, p=0.139). Logistic regression analysis revealed that only BMI was a significant determinant for the development of hepatocellular injuries (OR=3.46; 95% CI 1.06-11.34, p=0.041). Imaging studies failed to demonstrate any abnormalities, including fatty liver.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study indicated that lower BMI might significantly contribute to the development of hepatocellular injuries in AN patients prior to any nutritional treatments.",

Median cardiac troponin I was 12.2 ng/mL (range: 0.2-808.0 ng/mL), and troponin exceeded 1.0 ng/mL in 26 of 29 (90%) dogs. Ventricular ectopy was the most common arrhythmia (54%), whereas decreased left ventricular systolic function was the most common echocardiographic abnormality (56%). An infectious etiology was diagnosed in 35 of 64 (55%) dogs. Confirmed infectious etiologies included bacterial sepsis (n = 9) or extension of endocarditis (3), toxoplasmosis or neosporosis (3), parvovirus (2), and one case each of bartonellosis, trypanosomiasis, leptospirosis, and dirofilariasis. Median survival time was 4 days (range: 0-828 days) for all dogs vs. 82 days for dogs who survived at least 2 weeks after diagnosis. Presence of pericardial effusion or azotemia was a significant predictor of non-survival. The most common inflammatory infiltrate on histopathology was neutrophilic (47%), and 20 of 137 (14.5%) dogs had concurrent bacterial endocarditis on postmortem.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Bacterial infection was the most common confirmed etiology of myocarditis in this study. Prognosis for canine myocarditis is guarded and similar to that reported for infective endocarditis.

Over 6 years, the authors encountered nine skin and one lymph node biopsy specimens from six patients in whom light microscopy of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed melanocytic neoplasms with prominent pigment synthesis. Clinical follow-up was obtained by telephone contact with clinicians. There were three women, two men, and one boy, aged 9 to 85 years, whose lesions were described as blue-black nodules with irregular borders from 1.0 to 4.0 cm in size, located on the scalp, lower extremities, back, and sacrum. The dermatopathology comprised confluent dermal sheets of heavily melanized cells whose nuclei, where discernible, were large with irregularly thickened membranes, coarse chromatin, prominent, often spiculated nucleoli, and irregular parachromatinic clearing. Mitoses were infrequent. Four lesions had an epidermal component. One patient suffered metastases to regional lymph nodes, liver, and lungs with lethal effect, one experienced regional lymph node metastases but is still alive, one had local cutaneous metastases but was lost to follow-up, and one has a chest wall mass that has not yet been investigated.

Predefined outcomes were (1) rates of suicidal ideation based on random-effects pooled proportion and (2) relevant sociodemographic and clinical correlates, using random-effects odds ratio (OR) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>Fifteen studies and 13 independent samples, accounting for 10 400 subjects, were included in meta-analyses. The pooled proportion of suicidal ideation among stroke survivors was 11.8% (7.4% to 16.2%), with high heterogeneity across studies (I<sup>2</sup>=97.3%). Current (OR=11.50; p<0.001) and past (OR=6.96; p<0.001) depression, recurrent stroke (OR=1.77; p<0.001), disability (SMD=0.58; p=0.01) and cognitive impairment (SMD=-0.22; p=0.03) were all associated with suicidal ideation. Moreover, suicidal ideation was less likely in stroke survivors who were married (OR=0.63; p<0.001), employed (OR=0.57; p=0.02) and had higher education levels (OR=0.55; p=0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis shows that about one out of eight stroke survivors has suicidal ideation. Thus, there is enough evidence to support the use of routine screening and early interventions to prevent and treat suicidal ideation after stroke, especially among subjects carrying specific correlates.",

The JOA hip score consists of four subcategories: pain (Pain), range of motion (ROM), ability to walk (Gait), and activities of daily life (ADL). We present the first report to verify the reliability and validity of the JOA hip score.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 123 patients with osteoarthritis of a unilateral hip and 29 patients with osteonecrosis of a unilateral hip were investigated. The JOA hip score was recorded by orthopedic surgeons in their offices. On the same day, each patient answered a Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (Japanese version 1.2) by himself or herself. The SF-36 survey measures eight subscales. The internal-consistency reliability of the JOA hip score was evaluated by Cronbach's coefficient alpha. The validity of the JOA hip score was tested by Spearman's correlation coefficients between the four subcategories of the JOA hip score and the eight SF-36 subscales.<h4>Results</h4>When patients with osteoarthritis with conservative treatment were assessed by the JOA hip score, Cronbach's coefficient alpha was 0.70, demonstrating internal-consistency reliability. However, when the JOA hip score was used for other groups, Cronbach's coefficient alpha was <0.70, demonstrating the lack of internal-consistency reliability. Significant correlations were observed between Pain and bodily pain (r = 0.63), between Gait and physical functioning (PF) (r = 0.70), and between ADL and PF (r = 0.81), but not in any other combinations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found that the JOA hip score is a reliable system only for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip with conservative treatment. The JOA hip score is a scaling system with convergent and discriminant validity for the assessment of physical function and pain.",

The primary aim is to demonstrate that cochlear implants can function in the presence of retrocochlear pathology, even after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and hence to introduce this as a management option in selected patients with retrocochlear pathology, such as Neurofibromatosis type II (NFII) patients. A secondary aim is to act as a caveat that computed tomography (CT) scanning alone may not be sufficient imaging in subjects undergoing cochlear implantation (CI).<h4>Clinical presentation</h4>In this paper we report two patients who underwent cochlear implant despite the presence of a vestibular schwannoma (VS) on the same side. The first case is a 59-year-old male, diagnosed with VS after 9 months of good hearing with a cochlear implant. The second case is 26-year-old female known case of NFII, received a cochlear implant after controlling the tumor growth with a SRS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We show the consequences of missing important pre-implant pathology prior to CI in one case. In both cases, we add to the literature showing that cochlear implants can work well in the presence of VS, even in the presence of previous SRS. This adds significantly to the management options available to NFII patients, and the results seem to be better than those expected for auditory brainstem implant (ABI), and with a much simpler and safer intervention.",

Hemoadsorption (HA) is an emerging approach to modulate sepsis-induced inflammation. We sought to define the effects of HA on inflammatory compartmentalization in Escherichia coli-induced fibrin peritonitis in rats.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>HA both reprograms and recompartmentalizes inflammation in sepsis. Sprague Dawley male rats were subjected to E. coli peritonitis and, after 24 h, were randomized to HA or sham treatment (sepsis alone). Venous blood samples collected at 0, 1, 3 and 6 h (that is, 24-30 h of total experimental sepsis), and peritoneal samples collected at 0 and 6 h, were assayed for 14 cytokines along with NO(2)(-/)NO(3)(-). Bacterial counts were assessed in the peritoneal fluid at 0 and 6 h. Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, CXCL-1, and CCL2 were significantly reduced in HA versus sham. Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that inflammation in sham was driven by IL-6 and TNF-α, whereas HA-associated inflammation was driven primarily by TNF-α, CXCL-1, IL-10 and CCL2. Whereas -peritoneal bacterial counts, plasma aspartate transaminase levels and peritoneal IL-5, IL-6, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-γ and NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) were significantly lower, both CXCL-1 and CCL2 as well as the peritoneal-to-plasma ratios of TNF-α, CXCL-1 and CCL2 were significantly higher in HA versus sham, suggesting that HA-induced inflammatory recompartmentalization leads to the different inflammatory drivers discerned in part by PCA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the utility of combined in vivo/in silico methods and suggests that HA exerts differential effects on mediator gradients between local and systemic compartments that ultimately benefit the host.",

Our previous studies have shown that a hemoadsorption device (CytoSorb) removes both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and improves survival in experimental endotoxemia. We sought to determine whether hemoadsorption can also be effective in the treatment of sepsis.<h4>Design</h4>Randomized controlled laboratory experiment.<h4>Setting</h4>University laboratory.<h4>Interventions</h4>Rats were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and 20 hrs later were randomized to receive either hemoadsorption or sham treatment using an arterial-venous circuit. Hemoadsorption was accomplished using a cartridge containing Cytosorb beads. Blood was drawn for cytokine measurements and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was continuously monitored. Cytokines were measured via multiplex bead immunoassays. Survival time was observed for 9 hours after the intervention and assessed by Kaplan-Meier statistics. The overall survival in each group was compared using Fisher's exact test. Finally, we used a Cox proportional-hazards model to examine the effects of cytokine removal on survival time.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Baseline plasma cytokine concentrations and MAP were similar between hemoadsorption and sham-treated groups. However, the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly lower after hemoadsorption compared to the sham group. Six hours after treatment ended, IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were still lower in hemoadsorption group. MAP was significantly better in hemoadsorption compared to sham-treated animals (p < .05). Finally, mean survival time was significantly longer (720 vs. 381 min, p < .05, Mann-Whitney test), and overall survival was significantly better (11/17 vs. 2/16, p < .01) with hemoadsorption compared to sham. Combined reduction in both IL-6 and IL-10 was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death (hazard ratio, .11, p = .005).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Hemoadsorption reduced circulating cytokines, improved MAP, and resulted in better short-term survival in CLP-induced septic rats.",

Only one patient had marked visual recovery. Two clinical patterns were observed. A fulminant orbital syndrome presumably from compromise of large draining veins of the orbit was observed in one patient. A retrobulbar optic neuropathy that might have resulted from either direct injury or damage to small dural vessels of the posterior optic nerve was observed in the other two patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a risk of postoperative blindness after clipping of paraclinoid aneurysms. The frequency of this complication may increase because attempts to repair these aneurysms are becoming more common.

Many controversial questions remain concerning the best methods for conducting this process. An International Consensus Conference was held in April 2005 to provide recommendations regarding the management of this process. An 11-member international jury answered five pre-defined questions. 1) What is known about the epidemiology of weaning problems? 2) What is the pathophysiology of weaning failure? 3) What is the usual process of initial weaning from the ventilator? 4) Is there a role for different ventilator modes in more difficult weaning? 5) How should patients with prolonged weaning failure be managed? The main recommendations were as follows. 1) Patients should be categorised into three groups based on the difficulty and duration of the weaning process. 2) Weaning should be considered as early as possible. 3) A spontaneous breathing trial is the major diagnostic test to determine whether patients can be successfully extubated. 4) The initial trial should last 30 min and consist of either T-tube breathing or low levels of pressure support. 5) Pressure support or assist-control ventilation modes should be favoured in patients failing an initial trial/trials. 6) Noninvasive ventilation techniques should be considered in selected patients to shorten the duration of intubation but should not be routinely used as a tool for extubation failure.,

This injury was treated by the established standard for this surgical wound: immediate debridement. The wound had the same mechanism, pathology, bacteriology, and treatment as other similar wounds. Prognosis after high-pressure injection injuries, however, also depends on the substance injected. Treatment for cement injection injuries differs because of the unique properties of cement. Immediate intervention is necessary for decompression and minimization of chemical burn. Removing the final few fragments of cement after they have hardened may decrease the number of debridements and soft tissue destruction. Serial x-rays can be used to guide debridements, but if serial x-ray films are not obtained, a final x-ray is mandatory to ensure removal of all cement.",

Clearance of urea and ammonia solutes correlated closely (r = 0.819, P = 0.007). Ammonia clearance correlated closely with ultrafiltration rate (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). At 1 h, AC was 39 (34-54) ml/min (low volume) vs 85 (62-105) ml/min (high volume) CRRT, (P < 0.001) and at 24 h 44 (34-63) vs 105 (82-109) ml/min, (P = 0.01). Overall, a 22% reduction in median arterial ammonia concentration was observed over 24 h of HF from 156 (137-176) to 122 (85-133) μmol/L, (P ≤ 0.0001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Clinically significant ammonia clearance can be achieved in adult patients with hyperammonaemia utilizing continuous VVHF. Ammonia clearance is closely correlated with ultrafiltration rate. HF was associated with a fall in arterial ammonia concentration.",

B,"Starting from late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with deadly consequences, which urgently calls for new treatments, cures, and supporting apparatuses. Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The ∼100-fold improvement in the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.",

It is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating, with no compensatory behaviors. BED is often associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and still represents a challenge in terms of treatment strategies. In the last years, neuromodulation has represented a promising approach in the treatment of BED. We report the cases of two women, affected by Bipolar Disorder Type II (BD-II) and comorbid BED, whose BED symptoms improved after a course of accelerated intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS). <b>Methods:</b> We carried out a clinical study, involving neurostimulation on six patients with a treatment-resistant depressive episode. The trial consisted of a 3-week accelerated iTBS treatment, delivered to the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex. Clinical evaluation scales (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, and Young Mania Rating Scale) were administered at baseline, after 2 weeks, and at the end of the stimulation cycle. Pharmacotherapy was maintained unchanged during iTBS treatment. Patients gave their informed consent both for the protocol and for the publication. <b>Results:</b> The treatment was well-tolerated. Depressive symptoms only slightly improved; however, patients' binge episodes remitted completely, which was a serendipitous finding. BED symptomatology complete remission lasted up to 12 weeks follow-up. <b>Discussion:</b> This is the first study regarding iTBS use in BED in comorbidity with BD-II. Further research is still needed to assess the efficacy of this technique in BED treatment.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.732066/pdf

Review of literature and case reports.,,Akinbami BO.,2009,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,"Parotid gland injuries are accompanied by a large number of sequelae. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of thorough management of these parotid glandinjuries especially at initial presentation in order to minimize the complications that accompany these injuries. A review of the aetiology and management of the existing cases of parotid gland injuries obtained from published journals and internet search as well as a report of two cases managed in our centre is presented in this paper. A total of about 70 cases in the previous literatures were reviewed of which assault was responsible for almost 90% of the cases. Sialoceles and fistulae were the main sequelae of these injuries. More than half of the cases (54%) were managed by conservative methods. Surgical drainage was done in about 44% cases; where the Stenson's ducts were accessible, primary repair was done. Excision of the gland was done in very few cases. The two cases managed in our centre were due to assault from broken bottles and road traffic accident respectively and both were managed by conservative methods. The first patient was a case of sialocele following the injury, which resolved within 3 weeks after the cyst formation with reduction in food intake, aspirations and external surgical drainage; while the second patient was a case of persistent fistula which healed after about 5 weeks following the trauma. Follow-up of both patients for about 3 months revealed no further leakage or accumulation of saliva. Management of these injuries involves a thorough understanding of the structure and function of the parotid gland and closely related tissues.",

Both tumours were removed and resulted in histological diagnosis of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Chest X-ray established contrast-enhancing lesion in the left lung. Bronchoscopy was performed and histological examination revealed large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Postoperative skull irradiation and small-cell lung cancer chemotherapy protocol were utilized. Due to atelectasis and progression, chest irradiation was initiated, which was interrupted because of novel brain metastases. Further chemotherapy followed the non-small-cell lung cancer protocol. After 3 months, thoracic progression, brain and disseminated bone metastases were diagnosed. After a 14-month-long therapy, the patient deceased.

There is resultant salt wasting in the neonatal period, with hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis. Only after results confirm isolated resistance to aldosterone can the diagnosis of type 1 PHA be confidently made. Type 1 PHA can be further classified into i) renal type 1 (autosomal dominant (AD)) and ii) multiple target organ defect/systemic type 1 (autosomal recessive (AR)). The aim of this case series was to characterise the mode of presentation, management and short-term clinical outcomes of patients with PHA type 1. Case notes of newly diagnosed infants presenting with PHA type 1 were reviewed over a 5-year time period. Seven patients were diagnosed with PHA type 1. Initial presentation ranged from 4 to 28 days of age. Six had weight loss as a presenting feature. All subjects had hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, with elevated renin and aldosterone levels. Five patients have renal PHA type 1 and two patients have systemic PHA type, of whom one has had genetic testing to confirm the AR gene mutation on the SCNN1A gene. Renal PHA type 1 responds well to salt supplementation, whereas management of patients with systemic PHA type 1 proves more difficult as they are likely to get frequent episodes of electrolyte imbalance requiring urgent correction.<h4>Learning points</h4>Patients with type 1 PHA are likely to present in the neonatal period with hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis and can be diagnosed by the significantly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels.The differential diagnosis of type 1 PHA includes adrenal disorders such as adrenal hypoplasia and congenital adrenal hyperplasia; thus, adrenal function including cortisol levels, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and a urinary steroid profile are required. Secondary (transient) causes of PHA may be due to urinary tract infections or renal anomalies; thus, urine culture and renal ultrasound scan are required respectively.A differentiation between renal and systemic PHA type 1 may be made based on sodium requirements, ease of management of electrolyte imbalance, sweat test results and genetic testing.Management of renal PHA type 1 is with sodium supplementation, and requirements often decrease with age.Systemic PHA type 1 requires aggressive and intensive fluid and electrolyte management. Securing an enteral feeding route and i.v. access are essential to facilitate ongoing therapy.In this area of the UK, the incidence of AD PHA and AR PHA was calculated to be 1:66 000 and 1:166 000 respectively.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3922296?pdf=render

Optimal management of cIAI requires early source control in combination with adequate antimicrobial treatment and aggressive fluid resuscitation. cIAIs are mainly caused by Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes. Broad-spectrum single-agent or combination drug regimens against these microorganisms are the mainstay of therapy. However, development of antimicrobial resistance has become an increasingly large concern: multidrug-resistant organisms are associated with a higher rate of inadequate antimicrobial therapy, which in turn is associated with higher mortality rate, longer hospital stay, and increased cost compared to adequate antimicrobial therapy. In this mini-review, we discuss the effectiveness of several new antimicrobial agents, recently approved or in advanced phases of clinical development, for the treatment of cIAIs, including the new beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, aztreonam/avibactam), siderophore cephalosporins (cefiderocol), aminoglycosides (plazomicin), and tetracyclines (eravacycline).",

Requirements for inclusion in the study were incision and drainage in the operating room, involvement of more than 1 deep anatomic space, impending airway compromise, and maintenance of a postoperative artificial airway. The 85 patients were divided into 2 groups based on the type of airway used for treatment. Group 1 (n = 34) included patients who received a tracheotomy, and group 2 (n = 51) included patients whose airways were maintained with endotracheal intubation until the swelling had resolved sufficiently for extubation.<h4>Results</h4>Patients in group 1 had a shorter overall hospital stay (4.8 vs 5.9 days, NS) and spent less time in the intensive care unit (1.1 vs 3.1 days, P <.05). The overall incidence of complications was 6% for group 1 and 10% for group 2. The rate of complications secondary to loss of airway was 3% for group 1 and 6% for group 2. Average costs associated with intensive care resources were 5 times greater and overall hospital stay costs were 60% greater for group 2.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although both methods of airway control are useful and have a unique set of complications, the use of tracheotomy allowed earlier movement to a noncritical care unit and was associated with fewer intensive care costs and less overall cost of hospitalization. Tracheotomy may therefore provide better utilization of critical care resources in this group of patients.",
123,30987343,Mechanism of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir.,10.3390/v11040326,"Tchesnokov EP, Feng JY, Porter DP, Götte M.",2019,Viruses,"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1'-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1'-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2'-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2'-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/4/326/pdf

Here we describe the underlying genetic basis for the disorder, and we define the neuromuscular, respiratory and radiological phenotype in a study of 31 mutation carriers followed for up to 31 years. A combination of genome-wide linkage and whole exome sequencing revealed the likely causal genetic variant in the titin (TTN) gene (g.274375T>C; p.Cys30071Arg) within a shared haplotype of 2.93 Mbp on chromosome 2. This segregated with the phenotype in 21 individuals from the original family, nine subjects in a second family with the same highly selective pattern of muscle involvement on magnetic resonance imaging and a third familial case with a similar phenotype. Comparing the mutation carriers revealed novel features not apparent in our original report. The clinical presentation included predominant distal, proximal or respiratory muscle weakness. The age of onset was highly variable, from early adulthood, and including a mild phenotype in advanced age. Muscle weakness was earlier onset and more severe in the lower extremities in nearly all patients. Seven patients also had axial muscle weakness. Respiratory function studies demonstrated a gradual deterioration over time, reflecting the progressive nature of this condition. Cardiomyopathy was not present in any of our patients despite up to 31 years of follow-up. Magnetic resonance muscle imaging was performed in 21 affected patients and revealed characteristic abnormalities with semitendinosus involvement in 20 of 21 patients studied, including 3 patients who were presymptomatic. Diagnostic muscle histopathology most frequently revealed eosinophilic inclusions (inclusion bodies) and rimmed vacuoles, but was non-specific in a minority of patients. These findings have important clinical implications. This disease should be considered in patients with adult-onset proximal or distal myopathy and early respiratory failure, even in the presence of non-specific muscle pathology. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging findings are characteristic and should be considered as an initial investigation, and if positive should prompt screening for mutations in TTN. With 363 exons, screening TTN presented a major challenge until recently. However, whole exome sequencing provides a reliable cost-effective approach, providing the gene of interest is adequately captured.",

Sixteen patients were studied. The diagnosis of ACLF and AKI was made in accordance with current EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines, including the recommendations of the International Club of Ascites. All patients received SPAD/CVVHD treatments as the blood purification therapy to support liver, kidneys, and other organs. Five patients were transplanted and 11 were not listed for transplantation because of active alcoholism. Data at the initiation of SPAD/CVVHD were compared with early morning data after the termination of the extracorporeal treatment phase. All patients had ACLF and renal insufficiency with 13/16 additionally fulfilling the AKI criteria. A total of 37 SPAD/CVVHD treatments were performed [2.3 ± 1.4]. The baseline MELD-Na score was 37.6 ± 6.6 and decreased to 33.4 ± 8.7 after SPAD/CVVHD (P < 0.001). In parallel, the CLIF-C ACLF grade and OF score, estimated at 28- and 90-day mortality, AKI stage, hepatic encephalopathy grade, and liver function tests were lowered (P = 0.001-0.032). The 28- and 90-day survivals were 56.2% overall and 53.8% in AKI. Survival in patients not transplanted (n = 11) was 45.4%. In patients with severe ACLF and AKI, the renal replacement therapy coupled with high-performance albumin dialysis improved estimated 28- and 90-day survival and several key clinical and laboratory parameters.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis was formerly referred to as histiocytosis X, until it was renamed in 1987. Langerhans cell histiocytosis β was named for its morphological similarity to skin Langerhans cells. Studies have shown that LCH cells originate from myeloid dendritic cells rather than skin Langerhans cells. There has been significant debate regarding whether LCH should be defined as an immune disorder or a neoplasm. A breakthrough in understanding the pathogenesis of LCH occurred in 2010 when a gain-of-function mutation in BRAF (V600E) was identified in more than half of LCH patient samples. Studies have since reported that 100% of LCH cases show ERK phosphorylation, indicating that LCH is likely to be a clonally expanding myeloid neoplasm. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is now defined as an inflammatory myeloid neoplasm in the revised 2016 Histiocyte Society classification. Randomized trials and novel approaches have led to improved outcomes for pediatric patients, but no well-defined treatments for adult patients have been developed to date. Although LCH is not fatal in all cases, delayed diagnosis or treatment can result in serious impairment of organ function and decreased quality of life.

All section groups gathered face-to-face at annual Society of Critical Care Medicine congresses; virtual connections included those unable to attend. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed a priori and enforced throughout the process. Teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and whole panel were part of the guidelines' development. A general content review was completed face-to-face by all panel members in January 2017.<h4>Methods</h4>Content experts, methodologists, and ICU survivors were represented in each of the five sections of the guidelines: Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption). Each section created Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome, and nonactionable, descriptive questions based on perceived clinical relevance. The guideline group then voted their ranking, and patients prioritized their importance. For each Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome question, sections searched the best available evidence, determined its quality, and formulated recommendations as ""strong,"" ""conditional,"" or ""good"" practice statements based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation principles. In addition, evidence gaps and clinical caveats were explicitly identified.<h4>Results</h4>The Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) panel issued 37 recommendations (three strong and 34 conditional), two good practice statements, and 32 ungraded, nonactionable statements. Three questions from the patient-centered prioritized question list remained without recommendation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found substantial agreement among a large, interdisciplinary cohort of international experts regarding evidence supporting recommendations, and the remaining literature gaps in the assessment, prevention, and treatment of Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) in critically ill adults.

Two compared uterine arterial embolization (UAE) or uterine arterial chemoembolization (UACE) plus methotrexate (MTX) versus systemic MTX and subsequent dilation and suction curettage; one compared UACE plus MTX versus ultrasonography-guided local MTX injection; and two compared suction curettage under hysteroscopy versus suction curettage under ultrasonography after UAE/UACE. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main limitations were imprecision (small sample sizes and very wide confidence intervals (CI) for most analyses), multiple comparisons with a small number of trials, and insufficient data available to assess heterogeneity. UAE/UACE versus systemic MTX prior to suction curettage Two studies reported this comparison. One compared UAE with systemic MTX and one compared UACE plus MTX versus systemic MTX, in both cases followed by a suction curettage. We are uncertain whether UAE/UACE improved success rates after initial treatment (UAE: risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 72 women; low-quality evidence; UACE: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.38; 1 RCT, 28 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether UAE/UACE reduced rates of complications (UAE: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.75; 1 RCT, 72 women; low-quality evidence; UACE: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.48; 1 RCT, 28 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether UAE/UACE reduced adverse effects (UAE: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.11; 1 RCT, 72 women; low-quality evidence; UACE: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.24; 1 RCT, 28 women; low-quality evidence), and it was not obvious that the types of events had similar values to participants (e.g. fever versus vomiting). Blood loss was lower in UAE/UACE groups than systemic MTX groups (UAE: mean difference (MD) -378.70 mL, 95% CI -401.43 to -355.97; 1 RCT, 72 women; moderate-quality evidence; UACE: MD -879.00 mL, 95% CI -1135.23 to -622.77; 1 RCT, 28 women; moderate-quality evidence). Data were not available on time to normalize β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). UACE plus MTX versus ultrasonography-guided local MTX injection We are uncertain whether UACE improved success rates after initial treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.60; 1 RCT, 45 women; very low-quality evidence). Adverse effects: the study reported the same number of failed treatments in each arm (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.92; 1 RCT, 45 women). We are uncertain whether UACE shortened the time to normalize β-hCG (MD 1.50 days, 95% CI -3.16 to 6.16; 1 RCT, 45 women; very low-quality evidence). Data were not available for complications. Suction curettage under hysteroscopy versus under ultrasonography after UAE/UACE. Two studies reported this comparison. One compared suction curettage under hysteroscopy versus under ultrasonography after UAE, and one compared these interventions after UACE. We are uncertain whether suction curettage under hysteroscopy improved success rates after initial treatment (UAE: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.03; 1 RCT, 66 women; very low-quality evidence; UACE: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; 1 RCT, 92 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether suction curettage under hysteroscopy reduced rates of complications (UAE: RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.47 to 33.91; 1 RCT, 66 women; very low-quality evidence; UACE: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.72; 1 RCT, 92 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether suction curettage under hysteroscopy reduced adverse effects (UAE: RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.12 to 78.70; 1 RCT, 66 women; very low-quality evidence; UACE: not estimable; 1 RCT, 92 women; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether suction curettage under hysteroscopy shortened the time to normalize β-hCG (UAE: MD 4.03 days, 95% CI -1.79 to 9.85; 1 RCT, 66 women; very low-quality evidence; UACE: MD 0.84 days, 95% CI -1.90 to 3.58; 1 RCT, 92 women; low-quality evidence). Non-tubal ectopic pregnancy other than CSP No studies reported on non-tubal ectopic pregnancies in locations other than on a caesarean scar.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>For Caesarean scar pregnancies (CSP) it is uncertain whether there is a difference in success rates, complications, or adverse events between UAE/UACE and administration of systemic MTX before suction curettage (low-quality evidence). Blood loss was lower if suction curettage is conducted after UAE/UACE than after administration of systemic MTX (moderate-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in treatment success rates, complications, adverse effects or time to normalize β-hCG between suction curettage under hysteroscopy and under ultrasonography (very low-quality evidence). There are no studies of non-tubal ectopic pregnancy other than CSP and RCTs for these types of pregnancy are unlikely.",

The initial dose is dependent on the volume of distribution. Maintenance doses are dependent on clearance. Both should be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetic target associated with optimal bacterial killing, when known. The volume of distribution of some antibacterials is altered by critical illness or acute renal failure or both. Clearance by CRRT is dependent on the dose and mode of CRRT and the sieving or saturation coefficient of the drug. Both sieving and saturation coefficient are related to the plasma protein binding and thus may be altered in renal failure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Appropriate dose calculation requires knowledge of the pharmacokinetic target and the usual minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected organism in the patient's locality (or if unavailable, the break point for the organism), published pharmacokinetic data (volume of distribution, non-CRRT clearance) on critically ill patients receiving CRRT (which may differ substantially from noncritically ill patients or those without renal failure), the sieving or saturation coefficient of the relevant drug in critically ill patients, the dose and mode of CRRT being used, and the actual dose of CRRT that is delivered. This large number of variables results in considerable inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity in dose requirements. This article provides basic principles and relevant data to guide the clinician in prescribing individualized dosing regimes.",

It is usually diagnosed after surgery and at advanced stages as it does not possess specific clinical and radiological properties. The pathological examination of a 38-year-old female patient who had undergone nephrectomy due to a nonfunctioning right kidney caused by long-standing staghorn calculus revealed moderately differentiated renal pelvis SCC invading the renal parenchyma. The patient who experienced severe lumbar pain in the second postoperative month presented lymphadenopathy, which could not be detected with ultrasonography but was diagnosed with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (<sup>18</sup>FDG PET/CT). The patient received systemic treatment following the early diagnosis and survived past the average survival time.

Azacitidine added to venetoclax had promising efficacy in a previous phase 1b study.<h4>Methods</h4>We randomly assigned previously untreated patients with confirmed AML who were ineligible for standard induction therapy because of coexisting conditions, because they were 75 years of age or older, or both to azacitidine plus either venetoclax or placebo. All patients received a standard dose of azacitidine (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1 through 7 every 28-day cycle); venetoclax (target dose, 400 mg) or matching placebo was administered orally, once daily, in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was overall survival.<h4>Results</h4>The intention-to-treat population included 431 patients (286 in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 145 in the azacitidine-placebo [control] group). The median age was 76 years in both groups (range, 49 to 91). At a median follow-up of 20.5 months, the median overall survival was 14.7 months in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 9.6 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.85; P<0.001). The incidence of complete remission was higher with azacitidine-venetoclax than with the control regimen (36.7% vs. 17.9%; P<0.001), as was the composite complete remission (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) (66.4% vs. 28.3%; P<0.001). Key adverse events included nausea of any grade (in 44% of the patients in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 35% of those in the control group) and grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia (in 45% and 38%, respectively), neutropenia (in 42% and 28%), and febrile neutropenia (in 42% and 19%). Infections of any grade occurred in 85% of the patients in the azacitidine-venetoclax group and 67% of those in the control group, and serious adverse events occurred in 83% and 73%, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In previously untreated patients who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, overall survival was longer and the incidence of remission was higher among patients who received azacitidine plus venetoclax than among those who received azacitidine alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the venetoclax-azacitidine group than in the control group. (Funded by AbbVie and Genentech; VIALE-A ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02993523.).",

However, x-ray exposure is afflicted by the risk of developing malignancies as well as other deterministic effects of radiation. For this reason, radiation doses in the interventional laboratory should be reduced ""As Low As Reasonably Achievable"", with respect to the safety of the patients and the medical staff. This is of utmost importance in atrial fibrillation (AF) ablations, which are usually lengthy procedures. With the improvement of technology, the development of additional imaging tools and the widespread of 3D electroanatomic mapping systems (EAM), near-zero fluoroscopy AF ablation procedure is becoming a reality, limiting fluoroscopy use mainly to guide transseptal puncture.

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program data, we analyzed age-adjusted CL incidence rates (IRs) and survival rates by sex and race/ethnicity. There were 3884 CLs diagnosed during 2001-2005. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) accounted for 71% (age-adjusted incidence rate [IR] = 7.7/1 000 000 person-years), whereas cutaneous B-cell lymphomas(CBCLs) accounted for 29% (IR = 3.1/1 000 000 person-years). Males had a statistically significant higher IR of CL than females (14.0 vs 8.2/1 000 000 person-years, respectively; male-female IR ratio [M/F IRR] = 1.72; P < .001). CL IRs were highest among blacks and non-Hispanic whites (both 11.5/1 000 000 person-years), followed by Hispanic whites (7.9) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (7.1). The CTCL IR was highest among blacks (10.0/1 000 000 person-years), whereas the CBCL IR was highest among non-Hispanic whites (3.5). Over the past 25 years, the CL IR increased from 5.0/1 000 000 person-years during 1980-1982 to 14.3 during 2001-2003. During 2004-2005, the CL IR was 12.7. This recent apparent change could be incomplete case ascertainment or potential leveling off of IRs.

It often evolves through successive flares, and its severity varies from benign forms that don't require treatment to life threatening disease. Some patients have important functional impairment with psychological and social consequences and prolonged disability. LCH may affect only one organ, with uni- or multifocal involvement or be multisystem disease involving multiple organs. The organs most frequently involved are bones, lung, skin and the endocrinal system. Pulmonary LCH is strongly related to smoking. Some patients have mixed histocytosis combining LCH and other histiocytic disorders. The diagnosis relies on the histological study of tissues samples, and shows tissue infiltration with large cell with pale cytoplasm and reniform nucleus, staining for CD1a and Langerin (CD207) on immunohistochemistry. The BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation is observed in tissue samples in approximately half of patients and the activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway has been shown to be constantly activated in LCH lesions, regardless the BRAF status. These findings represent an important forward step in the understanding of the physiopathology of the disease. Treatment must be adapted to the severity of the disease and goes from conservative observation to systemic chemotherapy. Therapies targeting the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway are promising treatments for progressive disease.",

They are usually asymptomatic, and such the major clinical significance of their recognition is to prevent misdiagnosis, in addition to some having technical implications on invasive procedures.Typically, the venous blood from the upper half of the body is carried by the right-sided, superior vena cava (SVC), and some common congenital abnormalities found are persistent left SVC, SVC duplication, anomalous drainage of the brachiocephalic veins, or interruption of the SVC. The venous blood from the lower body is carried by the right-sided, inferior vena cava (IVC), and some common congenital abnormalities found are left-sided IVC, IVC duplication, the absence of IVC (total or just the infrarenal segment), and azygos continuation of the IVC. The azygos system of veins, running up the side of the thoracic vertebral column, connects both systems and can provide an alternative path to the right atrium when either of the venae cavae is absent. Other associated azygos-hemiazygos system anomalies are the azygos lobe and variable configuration of the azygos and hemiazygos veins.Such anomalies are reviewed with particular respect to their embryology and imagiological presentation, as knowledge of the normal anatomy and the most common congenital anomalies of the systemic venous return by a radiologist is important, being incidentally found.",https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13244-019-0802-y

In it's early stage pre operative staging with cystoscopy is a standard procedure for the detection of urinary bladder involvement.<h4>Aim</h4>The present study was conducted with the aim to compare the efficacy of Transvaginal Sonography (TVS) and cystoscopy in diagnosing bladder involvement in early stage cervical cancer patients by confirming it intraoperatively and further by histopathologic examination.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A prospective partially blinded study was conducted between March 2006 and September 2008 on 30 patients with early stage cervical cancer (Stage I and IIa) who were planned to undergo radical hysterectomy. Pre operatively, these patients underwent both TVS and cystoscopy to diagnose bladder involvement. Presence or absence of bladder involvement was then confirmed intra operatively and by histopathologic examination.<h4>Results</h4>In all the 30 patients studied, no bladder involvement was seen on cystoscopy where as TVS showed bladder involvement in three patients. Involvement of the bladder in these three patients was confirmed intra operatively and by histopathologic examination. Thus, in our study, TVS was 100% sensitive in detecting bladder involvement.<h4>Conclusion</h4>TVS is highly sensitive in diagnosing bladder involvement in early stage cervical cancer and could potentially detect cases missed with a cystoscopy.",

Genomic DNA from various regions of the tumor was extracted and digested with Hpa II, and a 511 bp region of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene was amplified with the polymerase chain reaction to assess clonality.<h4>Results</h4>The pathologic findings revealed areas of both adenocarcinoma and leiomyosarcoma, but these disparate areas were not randomly distributed but rather were polar in nature. The adenocarcinomatous areas localized to the tumor within the head of the pancreas, an area of normal ontogenetic glandular development, whereas the leiomyosarcomatous areas localized to regions of the tumor infiltrating the duodenal wall, an area of normal ontogenetic smooth muscle development. Both the adenocarcinomatous and the leiomyosarcomatous areas showed evidence of monoclonality and clonal identity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This interesting polar distribution of histologic patterns illustrated by this malignant mixed tumor (carcinosarcoma) supports the hypothesis of organ-induced differentiation of malignancy.",

In a separate set of experiments, we studied 12 animals using the same protocol except that we killed all animals at 4 hrs and removed standardized sections of liver for analysis of nuclear factor-kappaB DNA binding.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Mean survival time among hemoadsorption-treated animals was 629+/-114 vs. 518+/-120 mins for sham-treated animals (p <.01). Overall survival (defined at 12 hrs) was also significantly better in the hemoadsorption group, seven of 20 vs. one of 20 (p <.05). Plasma interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 concentrations and liver nuclear factor-kappaB DNA binding were significantly reduced by hemoadsorption. Ex vivo experiments showed no endotoxin adsorption but strengthened our in vivo observations by showing rapid adsorption of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Hemoadsorption was associated with reduced inflammation and improved survival in this murine model of septic shock.",

When these occur, urgent management is necessary to prevent deleterious sequelae such as meningitis, intracranial abscess, and pneumocephalus. Encephaloceles are rare occurrences characterized by herniation of intracranial contents through a skull base defect that can predispose patients to CSF rhinorrhea. In this report, we present a case of CSF rhinorrhea occurring 2 weeks after septoplasty likely from manipulation of an occult anterior skull base encephalocele. To our knowledge, no previous similar case has been reported in the literature. Otolaryngologists should be aware of the possibility of occult encephaloceles while performing septoplasties because minimal manipulation of these entities may potentially result in postoperative CSF leakage.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2500/ar.2013.4.0043

The differentiation of a benign from a malignant adrenal mass can be crucial especially in oncology patients since it would greatly affect treatment and prognosis. In this setting, imaging plays a key role in the detection and characterization of adrenal lesions, with several imaging tools which can be employed by radiologists. A thorough knowledge of the imaging features of adrenal masses is essential to better characterize these lesions, avoiding a misinterpretation of imaging findings, which frequently overlap between benign and malignant conditions, thus helping clinicians and surgeons in the management of patients. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the main imaging features of adrenal masses and tumor-like conditions recalling the strengths and weaknesses of imaging modalities commonly used in adrenal imaging.",https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13244-019-0688-8

We studied the safety and efficacy of total skin electron beam with allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Nineteen patients with advanced CTCL (median age, 50 years; four prior therapies) underwent total skin electron beam radiation followed by allogeneic HSCT between July 2001 and July 2008. Sixteen patients were conditioned with fludarabine (125 mg/m(2)) and melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) plus thymoglobulin (for mismatched donors). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was with tacrolimus/mini methotrexate.<h4>Results</h4>Eighteen patients experienced engraftment, and one died as a result of sepsis on day 16. Median time to recovery of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 12 days. Fifteen achieved full donor chimerism, 12 had acute GVHD, and 12 were treated for chronic GVHD. The overall intent-to-treat response was 68%, and the complete response rate was 58%. Four of six patients died in complete remission as a result of bacterial sepsis (n = 2), chronic GVHD and fungal infection (n = 1), or lung cancer (n = 1); only two died as a result of progressive disease. Eight experienced relapse in skin; five regained complete response with reduced immunosuppression or donor lymphocyte infusions. Eleven of 13 are currently in complete remissions, with median follow-up of 19 months (range, 1.3 to 8.3 years). Median overall survival has not been reached.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Total skin electron beam followed by allogeneic stem-cell transplantation merits additional evaluation for a selected group of patients with refractory, advanced, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with evidence for graft-versus-tumor effect.",

Blood sampling time points were 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months. Serum estrogens were measured with a highly sensitive and specific assay. This preplanned 12-month analysis evaluated E2, E1, E1S, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels in all patients and the proportion of patients with E2 levels greater than 2.72 pg/mL at any time point during treatment with exemestane plus triptorelin.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred sixteen patients (exemestane, n = 86; tamoxifen, n = 30; median age, 44 years; median E2, 51 pg/mL; 55% prior chemotherapy) started triptorelin and had one or more samples drawn. With exemestane plus triptorelin, median reductions from baseline E2, E1, and E1S levels were consistently ≥ 95%, resulting in significantly lower levels than with tamoxifen plus triptorelin at all time points.

Soft-tissue lipoma accounts for almost 50% of all soft-tissue tumors. Radiologic evaluation is diagnostic in up to 71% of cases. These lesions are identical to subcutaneous fat on computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images and may contain thin septa. Lipomatosis represents a diffuse overgrowth of mature fat affecting either subcutaneous tissue, muscle or nerve, and imaging is needed to evaluate lesion extent. Lipoblastoma is a tumor of immature fat occurring in young children, and imaging features may reveal a mixture of fat and nonadipose tissue. Angiolipoma, myolipoma, and chondroid lipoma are rare lipomatous lesions that are infrequently imaged. Spindle cell and pleomorphic lipoma appear as a subcutaneous lipomatous mass in the posterior neck or shoulder, with frequent nonadipose components. Hibernoma appears as a lipomatous mass with serpentine vascular elements. Benign lipomatous lesions affecting bone, joint, or tendon sheath include intraosseous lipoma, parosteal lipoma, liposclerosing myxofibrous tumor, discrete lipoma of joint or tendon sheath, and lipoma arborescens. Intraosseous and parosteal lipoma have a pathognomonic CT or MR appearance, with fat in the marrow space or on the bone surface, respectively. Liposclerosing myxofibrous tumor is a rare intermixed histologic lesion commonly located in the medullary canal of the intertrochanteric femur. Benign lipomatous lesions may occur focally in a joint or tendon sheath or with diffuse villonodular proliferation in the synovium (lipoma arborescens) and are diagnosed based on location and identification of fat. Understanding the spectrum of appearances of the various benign musculoskeletal lipomatous lesions improves radiologic assessment and is vital for optimal patient management.",

The average follow-up was 81.2 ± 45 months. The anterior circulation was involved in 76.8% of GIAs. If the GIA showed a clear neck, minimal atherosclerosis, or intrasaccular thrombosis, and ≤2 branches arising from the neck, it was reconstructed. This procedure was possible in 78% of cases. The technique also involved temporary clipping, remodeling, and thrombectomy, as well as fragmentation techniques. Angioarchitectural features other than these techniques underwent bypass and aneurysm trapping. Most bypasses were extracranial to intracranial and high flow. Flow capacity, collateral circulation, and availability of the donor vessel mainly affected the choice of the type of bypass. Overall, successful exclusion of the GIA was 91.4%. The need for retreatment and complication rate were 3.6% and 19.5%, respectively. A good overall outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-3) was achieved in 84.2% of patients, and mortality was 10%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Microneurosurgical techniques still maintain a significant role for most GIAs, with a high durability and acceptable rate of morbidity and mortality. Clip reconstruction is the first-line surgical treatment option, whereas bypass is indicated in cases of planned or unplanned sacrifice of the parent artery to prevent long-term ischemic complications.",

There is a lack of study implementing the Budapest criteria for PS-CRPS diagnosis. Thus, the present study investigated the validity of the Budapest criteria for PS-CRPS diagnosis and assessed the PS-CRPS-related factors in stroke patients with an affected upper extremity.<h4>Methods</h4>The study included 72 patients with first-ever stroke resulting in hemiplegia. The prevalence of PS-CRPS and diagnostic validity were compared among the Budapest clinical criteria, Budapest research criteria, modified Budapest criteria (removal of the motor factor from the motor/trophic category), and International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria in patients diagnosed with PS-CRPS according to the Budapest clinical criteria.<h4>Results</h4>PS-CRPS was diagnosed in 6 (8.3%), 1 (1.4%), 6 (8.3%), and 11 patients (15.3%) according to the Budapest clinical criteria, Budapest research criteria, modified Budapest criteria, and IASP criteria, respectively. The Budapest criteria and IASP criteria had sensitivities of 0.99 and 1.00, respectively, and specificities of 0.68 and 0.41, respectively, for PS-CRPS diagnosis. There were no differences in risk factors between PS-CRPS patients and non-PS-CRPS patients when the diagnosis was based on the Budapest clinical criteria. However, there were differences in muscle strength and Brunnstrom stage between PS-CRPS patients and non-PS-CRPS patients when the diagnosis was based on the IASP criteria.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our findings indicate that the diagnostic validity of the current Budapest clinical criteria for PS-CRPS is low. Thus, the current Budapest criteria might not be appropriate for PS-CRPS diagnosis.",

We previously identified PRKAR1A (regulatory subunit 1alpha of protein kinase A) mutations in CNC. Mutational analyses of the PRKAR1A gene in 51 unrelated CNC probands now detect mutations in 65%. All mutations, except for one unique missense mutation, lead to PRKAR1A haploinsufficiency. Therefore, we studied the consequences of prkar1a haploinsufficiency in mice. Although we did not observe cardiac myxomas or altered pigmentation in prkar1a(+/-) mice, we did observe some phenotypes similar to CNC, including altered heart rate variability. Moreover, prkar1a(+/-) mice exhibited a marked propensity for extracardiac tumorigenesis. They developed sarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. Sarcomas were frequently associated with myxomatous differentiation. Tumors from prkar1a(+/-) mice did not exhibit prkar1a loss of heterozygosity.

Our objective is to evaluate hearing outcomes following ipsilateral cochlear implantation in patients with NF2 and irradiated vestibular schwannomas (VS), and sporadic VS that have been irradiated or observed.<h4>Methods</h4>Multi-center retrospective analysis of ipsilateral cochlear implantation in the presence of observed and irradiated VS. MESH search in NCBI PubMed database between 1992 and 2019 for reported cases of cochlear implantation with unresected vestibular schwannoma.<h4>Results</h4>Seven patients underwent ipsilateral cochlear implantation in the presence of observed or irradiated vestibular schwannomas. Four patients had sporadic tumors with severe-profound contralateral hearing loss caused by presbycusis/hereditary sensorineural hearing loss, and three patients with NF2 lost contralateral hearing after prior surgical resection. Prior to implantation, one VS was observed without growth for a period of 7 years and the others were treated with radiotherapy. Mean post-operative sentence score was 63.9% (range 48-91) at an average of 28 (range 2-84) months follow up. All patients in this cohort obtained open set speech perception. While analysis of the literature is limited by heterogenous data reporting, 85% of implants with observed schwannomas achieved some open set perception, and 67% of patients previously radiated schwannomas. Furthermore, blending literature outcomes for post implantation sentence testing in quiet without lip-reading show 59.0 ± 35% for patients with CI and observed tumors and 55.7 ± 35% for patients with radiated tumors, with both groups ranging 0 to 100%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This retrospective series and literature review highlight that hearing outcomes with CI for VS patients are superior to those achieved with ABI. However, important considerations including imaging, delayed hearing loss, and observation time cannot be ignored in this population.",

The disease is often therapy resistant, the natural course not always favorable. The diagnosis of CRPS is based on signs and symptoms derived from medical history and physical examination. Pharmacological pain management and physical rehabilitation of limb function are the main pillars of therapy and should be started as early as possible. If, however, there is no improvement of limb function and persistent severe pain, interventional pain management techniques may be considered. Intravenous regional blocks with guanethidine did not prove superior to placebo but frequent side effects occurred.Therefore this technique receives a negative recommendation (2 A-). Sympathetic block is the interventional treatment of first choice and has a 2 B+ rating. Ganglion stellatum (stellate ganglion) block with repeated local anesthetic injections or by radiofrequency denervation after positive diagnostic block is documented in prospective and retrospective trials in patients suffering from upper limb CRPS. Lumbar sympathetic blocks can be performed with repeated local anesthetic injections. For a more prolonged lumbar sympathetic block radiofrequency treatment is preferred over phenol neurolysis because effects are comparable whereas the risk for side effects is lower (2 B+). For patients suffering from CRPS refractory to conventional treatment and sympathetic blocks, plexus brachialis block or continuous epidural infusion analgesia coupled with exercise therapy may be tried (2 C+). Spinal cord stimulation is recommended if other treatments fail to improve pain and dysfunction (2 B+). Alternatively peripheral nerve stimulation can be considered, preferentially in study conditions (2 C+).",

Evidence about perspectives of Italian physicians on the relevance of musculoskeletal (MSK) pain care to improve patients' functioning and Quality of Life is scant. The study aimed to investigate the physicians' perception of the value of functional recovery in severe MSK pain patients, their attitude towards its assessment and achievement in Italy.<h4>Methods</h4>A survey was conducted in Italy between October 2020 and January 2021. Specialist centers members of the SIAARTI (n = 395) were sent an online questionnaire encompassing the Italian pain therapy network. Participants rated their agreement to questionnaire items according to a 5-point Likert-type scale.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 305 centers (77%) completed the survey. Most physicians rated the recovery of functioning as very relevant in MSK pain treatment and, when they assessed it, devoted great attention to the ability to perform daily activities, pain, ability to ambulate and sleep quality. Multidimensional questionnaires were less employed in favor of physical examination and pain intensity scales. Pharmacological therapy, rehabilitation and lifestyle changes and/or physical exercise were all rated optimal strategies to pursue the recovery of patients' functioning. When considering pharmacological therapy, weak and strong opioids, either alone or combined with paracetamol, were the most frequently employed analgesics.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Clinicians seem to recognize the recovery of functioning as equally important as pain intensity reduction, but there is a need of streamlining available tools to effectively assess both across different MSK pain patients.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=75397

We aimed to develop a protocol for systematic examination of the fetal venous system during midtrimester targeted organ scanning.<h4>Methods</h4>We included low-risk women with a singleton fetus presenting between January 2011 and June 2013 to our center for routine midtrimester (20-24 weeks) targeted organ scanning. Imaging of the venous system was added to the booked scan and comprised two-dimensional color Doppler scanning of the fetal abdomen in three discrete planes, two transverse and one longitudinal. The more caudal plane was obtained in a ventral or lateral transverse abdominal plane to image the umbilical vein, left portal vein, portal sinus, anterior right portal vein, posterior right portal vein, main portal vein and splenic vein and artery. Moving cephalad, a ventral or lateral transverse plane was obtained to image the right, middle and left hepatic veins and inferior vena cava (IVC). Finally, a longitudinal anteroposterior plane showed the umbilical vein, ductus venosus, IVC and left hepatic vein. In some cases the pulsed Doppler waveform of a given target vessel was also examined. Three-dimensional/4D ultrasound was applied as necessary, when anomalous cases were encountered.<h4>Results</h4>We examined 1810 women. Their body mass index ranged from 19 to 40 (mean, 24.7). In 38 (2.1%) women, the target anatomy was not visualized satisfactorily owing to maternal body habitus. A T-shaped configuration of the portal system vessels was observed in 63% of cases, an X-shaped configuration in 25% and an H-shaped configuration in 12%. During the study period, 24 congenital anomalies of the precordial venous system were diagnosed: nine cases of persistent right umbilical vein, seven of agenesis of the ductus venosus, five of anomalous portal venous drainage and three of interrupted IVC with azygos continuation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Examination of the fetal venous system is feasible with the application of three abdominal planes. While a venous system scan is not practicable as part of a screening-level examination, mastery of the normal anatomy is an essential part of the professional knowledge base, in order to provide ready and complete scanning of the system in cases of suspected anomalies or disordered cardiac function.",

The first 40 isolates were fully characterized by the most common phenotypic tests mentioned in the literature, while the last 317 where identified solely by the established minimum requirements for rapid and reliable routine identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum. All but one isolate were identical in all phenotypic tests. The outlying strain differed in morphology and the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes. On the basis of our findings it should be possible within 3-4 days to identify and differentiate F. necrophorum from other species including other Fusobacterium spp. by the unique but subspecies specific colony morphology, susceptibility to kanamycin and metronidazole, the smell of butyric acid, chartreuse colour fluorescence, and beta-haemolysis on horse blood agar. Three-hundred fifty-six isolates were identified as F. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme while one strain was F. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum. The species and subspecies level was confirmed for the first 40 isolates by real-time PCR. MIC in mg/l was determined for the 40 isolates. MIC(90) was 0.047 for penicillin, 0.047 for clindamycin, 0.25 for metronidazole, 0.38 for cefuroxime, >32 for imipenem, 0.012 for meropenem, and 2 for erythromycin. All 357 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and metronidazole indicating that these antibiotics are still the drugs of choice in antibiotic therapy of F. necrophorum infections, but therapy with clindamycin may be an alternative. Erythromycin should be avoided.",

Tumors with these characteristics rarely occur as congenital lesions. We performed genomic analysis of a congenital pigment synthesizing melanocytic neoplasm with indeterminate biological potential.<h4>Observations</h4>The patient was a 5-month-old girl presenting with a 6-cm protuberant scalp mass, which had doubled in size since birth. Histologic examination showed heavily pigmented intradermal proliferation of large, epithelioid melanocytes with mild cytologic atypia, low mitotic activity, focal necrosis, and ulceration. RNA sequencing identified a novel ATPase, Ca2+ transporting, plasma membrane 4(ATP2B4)-protein kinase C-alpha (PRKCA) fusion transcript. The fusion resulted in an in-frame linkage of the PRKCA catalytic domain with the N-terminal of ATP2B4 and high expression of the PRKCA kinase domain. Break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization showed PRKCA rearrangement, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of the fusion transcript. The patient was alive and well, with no evidence of recurrence, at the 1-year follow-up.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>To our knowledge, this is the first report of PRKCA fusions in melanocytic neoplasms. Future studies need to determine the frequency of PRKCA fusions in pigment-synthesizing melanocytic neoplasms.",

It is unclear, however, whether such disturbances are linked to specific alterations in the processing of body configurations with respect to the local processing of body part details. Here, we compared a consecutive sample of 12 AN patients with a group of 12 age-, gender- and education-matched controls using an inversion effect paradigm requiring the visual discrimination of upright and inverted pictures of whole bodies, faces and objects. The AN patients presented selective deficits in the discrimination of upright body stimuli, which requires configural processing. Conversely, patients and controls showed comparable abilities in the discrimination of inverted bodies, which involves only detail-based processing, and in the discrimination of both upright and inverted faces and objects. Importantly, the body inversion effect negatively correlated with the persistence scores at the Temperament and Character Inventory, which evaluates increased tendency to convert a signal of punishment into a signal of reinforcement. These results suggest that the deficits of configural processing in AN patients may be associated with their obsessive worries about body appearance and to the excessive attention to details that characterizes their general perceptual style.",

AOP infarcts are often missed on initial computed tomography (CT) scan, and additional imaging is usually not done due to low suspicion for stroke in most cases. There have been an increasing number of reports of AOP infarction, illustrating the diversity of clinical presentations and the challenge this presents to clinicians in the acute setting. Lacking the classic signs of stroke, many of these patients experience a delay in recognition and treatment, with the majority of diagnoses occurring outside the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) window.

This strategy utilizes whole-genome amplification, followed by triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) detection of expanded <i>DMPK</i> alleles, in parallel with single-tube haplotype analysis of 12 closely linked and highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. Bidirectional TP-PCR and dodecaplex marker PCR assays were optimized and validated on whole-genome amplified single lymphoblasts isolated from DM1 reference cell lines, and tested on a simulated PGT-M case comprising a parent-offspring trio and three simulated embryos. Bidirectional <i>DMPK</i> TP-PCR reliably detects repeat expansions even in the presence of non-CTG interruptions at either end of the expanded allele.

Venetoclax has already received 'breakthrough' designation for acute myeloid leukemia, and is being studied in many other tumor types. However, resistance to BCL-2 inhibitor monotherapy may rapidly ensue. Several studies have shown that the other two major anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1, are the main determinants of resistance to venetoclax. This opens up possibilities for rationally combining venetoclax with other targeted agents to circumvent resistance. Here, we summarize the most promising combinations, and highlight those already in clinical trials. There is also increasing recognition that different tumors display different degrees of addiction to individual BCL-2 family proteins, and of the need to refine current 'BH3 profiling' techniques. Finally, the successful clinical development of potent and selective antagonists of BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1 is eagerly awaited.",

Heart disease is not considered part of the typical CM spectrum. No congenital heart defect has been reported, and childhood-onset cardiomyopathy has been documented in only two CM families with homozygous mutations of the TTN gene. TTN encodes titin, a giant protein of striated muscles. Recently, heterozygous TTN truncating mutations have also been reported as a major cause of dominant dilated cardiomyopathy. However, relatively few TTN mutations and phenotypes are known, and titin pathophysiological role in cardiac and skeletal muscle conditions is incompletely understood. We analyzed a series of 23 families with congenital CM and primary heart disease using TTN M-line-targeted sequencing followed in selected patients by whole-exome sequencing and functional studies. We identified seven novel homozygous or compound heterozygous TTN mutations (five in the M-line, five truncating) in 17% patients. Heterozygous parents were healthy. Phenotype analysis identified four novel titinopathies, including cardiac septal defects, left ventricular non-compaction, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy or arthrogryposis. Additionally, in vitro studies documented the first-reported absence of a functional titin kinase domain in humans, leading to a severe antenatal phenotype. We establish that CM are associated with a large range of heart conditions of which TTN mutations are a major cause, thereby expanding the TTN mutational and phenotypic spectrum. Additionally, our results suggest titin kinase implication in cardiac morphogenesis and demonstrate that heterozygous TTN truncating mutations may not manifest unless associated with a second mutation, reassessing the paradigm of their dominant expression.",

The authors sought to describe the onset and outcomes of anorexia nervosa in the general population.<h4>Method</h4>Lifetime prevalences, incidence rates, and 5-year recovery rates of anorexia nervosa were calculated on the basis of data from 2,881 women from the 1975-1979 birth cohorts of Finnish twins. Women who screened positive for eating disorder symptoms (N=292), their screen-negative female co-twins (N=134), and 210 randomly selected screen-negative women were assessed for lifetime eating disorders by telephone by experienced clinicians. To assess outcomes after clinical recovery and to detect residua of illness, women who had recovered were compared with their unaffected co-twins and healthy unrelated women on multiple outcome measures.<h4>Results</h4>The lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV anorexia nervosa was 2.2%, and half of the cases had not been detected in the health care system. The incidence of anorexia nervosa in women between 15 and 19 years of age was 270 per 100,000 person-years. The 5-year clinical recovery rate was 66.8%. Outcomes did not differ between detected and undetected cases. After clinical recovery, the residua of illness steadily receded. By 5 years after clinical recovery, most probands had reached complete or nearly complete psychological recovery and closely resembled their unaffected co-twins and healthy women in weight and most psychological and social measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The authors found a substantially higher lifetime prevalence and incidence of anorexia nervosa than reported in previous studies, most of which were based on treated cases. Most women recovered clinically within 5 years, and thereafter usually progressed toward full recovery.",

Although many directly affect protein expression, an increasing proportion of mutations is now believed to influence mRNA splicing. They mostly affect existing splice sites, but synonymous, non-synonymous or nonsense mutations can also create or disrupt splice sites or auxiliary cis-splicing sequences. To facilitate the analysis of the different mutations, we designed Human Splicing Finder (HSF), a tool to predict the effects of mutations on splicing signals or to identify splicing motifs in any human sequence. It contains all available matrices for auxiliary sequence prediction as well as new ones for binding sites of the 9G8 and Tra2-beta Serine-Arginine proteins and the hnRNP A1 ribonucleoprotein. We also developed new Position Weight Matrices to assess the strength of 5' and 3' splice sites and branch points. We evaluated HSF efficiency using a set of 83 intronic and 35 exonic mutations known to result in splicing defects. We showed that the mutation effect was correctly predicted in almost all cases.

The decrease in nitric oxide (NO) in tissue that occurs early after BVO accounts for the secondary arteriolar constriction. The present study shows that the administration of an NO donor can reverse the secondary arteriolar vasoconstriction observed after BVO.<h4>Methods</h4>Simultaneous preretinal NO profiles and arteriolar diameter measurements were performed in miniature pigs after experimental BVO. The effect of preretinal microinjections of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on the arteriolar diameter was studied.<h4>Results</h4>Significant arteriolar vasoconstriction (mean arteriolar diameter, 92.1% +/- 3.3% of control; n = 7; P = 7.4 x 10(-5)) and a simultaneous decrease in the preretinal NO concentration ([NO]) (preretinal [NO], 20% +/- 15.6% of control; n = 5; P = 0.0003) were observed 4 hours after BVO. Microinjection of the NO donor SNP (1 mM applied by puffer) near the constricted retinal arteriole caused a segmental, reversible arteriolar dilation that reached its maximum 20 minutes after the injection (mean arteriolar diameter; 110.8% +/- 7.5% of control; n = 6; P = 0.02) and was completely reversed 60 minutes later (n = 6).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Local administration of NO donors may contribute to the restoration of the retinal arteriolar blood flow after BVO and thus may improve the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the injured tissue.",

Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) has become the second major cause of AP. Although the association between HTG and AP is well established, HTG as a risk factor of AP in the general population is not well identified. In this review, we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of HTG-AP and clinical management of this disease. The mechanism responsible for HTG-AP is related to high-level free fatty acid (FFA), microcirculatory disorder, oxidative stress, Ca2+ overload, and genetic polymorphism. Heparin and insulin therapy in diabetic patients with HTG can dramatically reduce triglyceride levels. Use of plasmapheresis is still experimental and better-designed studies are needed to evaluate the promise in the management of HTG-AP. Dietary intervention, lifestyle changes, and control of secondary causes are critical to the management and treatment of HTG-AP.",

Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, which detect genomic copy number alterations (CNAs), can be helpful in distinguishing between nevi and melanoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used as a more rapid, less expensive alternative to SNP array, using a panel of probes that are often gained or lost in melanoma. We used SNP array data from 63 borderline cutaneous melanocytic lesions and 44 definitive melanomas to predict the performance of FISH testing. Lesions were considered positive by ""virtual FISH"" if 1 or more of the 5 FISH-probed loci demonstrated appropriate CNAs by SNP array. Cases were classified as positive by SNP array if ≥3 CNAs were present, based on internal validation studies, or if FISH criteria were met. Conventional FISH was performed in 33 cases (17 borderline lesions, 16 melanomas). Of the 63 borderline cases, 44 (70%) were positive by SNP array and 30 (48%) were positive by virtual FISH. A higher proportion of melanomas were positive by SNP array (41/44, 93% sensitivity) and virtual FISH (36/44, 82% sensitivity). Virtual FISH had 61% sensitivity in the borderline group using SNP array as the gold standard, whereas specificity was 84%. There was good correlation between conventional and virtual FISH, with agreement in 30 of 33 (91%) cases. Although FISH is highly effective in distinguishing between nevi and melanoma in cases where the histological diagnosis is straightforward, it is not nearly as sensitive or specific as SNP array when applied to borderline lesions.",

The aim of this study was to confirm whether Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for VSs continues to be safe and effective > 10 years after treatment. Methods A total of 440 patients with VS (including neurofibromatosis Type 2) treated with GKS between May 1991 and December 2000 were evaluable. Of these, 347 patients (79%) underwent GKS as an initial treatment and 93 (21%) had undergone prior resection. Three hundred fifty-eight patients (81%) had a solid tumor and 82 (19%) had a cystic tumor. The median tumor volume was 2.8 cm(3) and the median marginal dose was 12.8 Gy. Results The median follow-up period was 12.5 years. The actuarial 5- and ≥ 10-year progression-free survival was 93% and 92%, respectively. No patient developed treatment failure > 10 years after treatment. According to multivariate analysis, significant factors related to worse progression-free survival included brainstem compression with a deviation of the fourth ventricle (p < 0.0001), marginal dose ≤ 13 Gy (p = 0.01), prior treatment (p = 0.02), and female sex (p = 0.02). Of 287 patients treated at a recent optimum dose of ≤ 13 Gy, 3 (1%) developed facial palsy, including 2 with transient palsy and 1 with persistent palsy after a second GKS, and 3 (1%) developed facial numbness, including 2 with transient and 1 with persistent facial numbness. The actuarial 10-year facial nerve preservation rate was 97% in the high marginal dose group (> 13 Gy) and 100% in the low marginal dose group (≤ 13 Gy). Ten patients (2.3%) developed delayed cyst formation. One patient alone developed malignant transformation, indicating an incidence of 0.3%. Conclusions In this study GKS was a safe and effective treatment for the majority of patients followed > 10 years after treatment. Special attention should be paid to cyst formation and malignant transformation as late adverse radiation effects, although they appeared to be rare. However, it is necessary to collect further long-term follow-up data before making conclusions about the long-term safety and efficacy of GKS, especially for young patients with VSs.",

As a relatively newly described entity, SSC-CIP is still underdiagnosed, and the diagnosis is often delayed. The present study aims to improve the early detection of SSC-CIP and the identification of its complications.A total of 2633 records of patients who underwent or were listed for orthotopic liver transplantation at the University Hospital Charité, Berlin, were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical presentation and outcome (mean follow-up 62.7 months) of the 16 identified SSC-CIP cases were reviewed.Cholestasis was the first sign of SSC-CIP. GGT was the predominant enzyme of cholestasis. Hypercholesterolemia occurred in at least 75% of the patients. SSC-CIP provoked a profound weight loss (mean 18 kg) in 94% of our patients. SSC-CIP was diagnosed by ERC in all patients. The 3 different cholangiographic features detected correspond roughly to the following stages: (I) evidence of biliary casts, (II) progressive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, and (III) picture of pruned tree. Biliary cast formation is a hallmark of SSC-CIP and was seen in 87% of our cases. In 75% of the patients, the clinical course was complicated by cholangiosepsis, cholangitic liver abscesses, acalculous cholecystitis, or gallbladder perforation. SSC-CIP was associated with worse prognosis; transplant-free survival was ∼40 months (mean).Because of its high rate of serious complications and unfavorable prognosis, it is imperative to diagnose SSC-CIP early and to differentiate SSC-CIP from other types of sclerosing cholangitis. Specific characteristics enable identification of SSC-CIP. Early cooperation with a transplant center and special attention to biliary complications are required after diagnosis of SSC-CIP.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5008492?pdf=render

Here, we investigate the value of whole exome sequencing in fetuses with sonographic abnormalities but normal microarray analysis.<h4>Method</h4>Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from chorionic villi or amniocytes in 24 fetuses with unexplained ultrasound findings. In the first 14 cases sequencing was initially performed on fetal DNA only. For the remaining 10, the trio of fetus, mother and father was sequenced simultaneously.<h4>Results</h4>In 21% (5/24) cases, exome sequencing provided definitive diagnoses (Milroy disease, hypophosphatasia, achondrogenesis type 2, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Baraitser-Winter Syndrome). In a further case, a plausible diagnosis of orofaciodigital syndrome type 6 was made. In two others, a single mutation in an autosomal recessive gene was identified, but incomplete sequencing coverage precluded exclusion of the presence of a second mutation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Whole exome sequencing improves prenatal diagnosis in euploid fetuses with abnormal ultrasound scans. In order to expedite interpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be compromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes.",

The clinicopathologic characteristics of the largest series of lung carcinomas initially presenting with GI involvement were described, focusing on differential diagnosis and therapeutic options.<h4>Methods</h4>Eighteen consecutive cases of lung cancer (11 surgical specimens and 7 biopsies) initially diagnosed on GI histologic samples were identified during routine pathologist practice. All cases were immunostained with thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2), and cytokeratins 7 (CK7) and 20 (CK20). Clinical and radiological data were obtained in all cases.<h4>Results</h4>There were 10 women and 8 men with a mean age of 68.5 years. The small bowel was the most common GI involved site (12 cases), followed by the stomach (four) and large intestine (two). Only half of cases were correctly diagnosed on GI biopsies. Fourteen patients died shortly from disease (mean follow-up, 3 months); two are still alive with multiple metastases, and two patients with the GI tract as the unique site of metastasis underwent pulmonary lobectomy and chemotherapy and are alive without evidence of disease. At morphology, there were 10 large cell undifferentiated carcinomas and eight adenocarcinomas. All cases were immunostained for CK7 and 89% for TTF-1, whereas CK20 and CDX2 were completely negative.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Lung cancer presenting as GI-tract metastasis is probably more frequent than expected, and pathologists should always keep in mind this possibility when dealing with undifferentiated GI carcinoma. Immunostaining with TTF-1, CDX2, CK7, and CK20 is helpful in highlighting lung primary. Although GI metastasis from lung cancer is associated with dismal outcomes, pulmonary resection coupled with chemotherapy might represent a therapeutic option in selected patients with a solitary GI-tract metastasis.",

Our objective was to determine how often patients being treated with ICI develop hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis compared with other cancer therapeutics and whether the survival of patients who underwent pericardiocentesis differs according to ICI use versus standard cancer therapeutics. Our institutional review board approved catheterization laboratory data collection for all pericardiocenteses performed and all patients receiving ICI from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. Retrospective review of the electronic medical record was performed to identify cancer therapeutics given preceding pericardiocentesis. Log-rank analysis was performed to compare survival in patients requiring pericardiocentesis between those on ICI and those not on ICI. Overall, 3,966 patients received ICI of which only 15 pericardiocenteses were required, including 1 repeat pericardiocentesis in a patient on nivolumab. The prevalence of pericardiocentesis among patients on ICI was 0.38% (15/3,966). Eleven pericardiocenteses were performed after nivolumab infusion, 3 after pembrolizumab, and 1 after atezolizumab, with pericardiocentesis prevalences for each agent of 0.61% (11/1,798), 0.19% (3/1,560), and 0.32% (1/309), respectively. One hundred and twenty pericardiocentesis were performed on patients receiving other cancer therapeutics although no therapeutic agent was associated with more pericardiocenteses than nivolumab.

Recommendations for diagnostic testing of antithrombin function and concentration, derived from the medical literature and consensus opinions of recognized experts in the field, are included. These recommendations specify whom, how, and when to test.<h4>Data sources</h4>Review of the published medical literature.<h4>Data extraction and synthesis</h4>A summary of the medical literature and proposed testing recommendations were prepared and presented at the College of American Pathologists Conference XXXVI: Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia. After discussion at the conference, consensus recommendations presented in this article were accepted after a two-thirds majority vote by the participants.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Antithrombin deficiency is an infrequent genetic abnormality that may be a significant contributing cause of thrombophilia. Antithrombin deficiency also may be observed in conjunction with other genetic or acquired risk factors. Assay of antithrombin plasma levels is appropriate in the laboratory evaluation of individuals with thrombophilia, preferably using a functional, amidolytic antithrombin assay. The diagnosis of antithrombin deficiency should be established only after other acquired causes of antithrombin deficiency, such as liver disease, consumptive coagulopathy, or heparin therapy, are excluded. A low antithrombin level should be confirmed with a subsequent assay on a fresh specimen, and family studies may be helpful to establish the diagnosis. Antigenic antithrombin assays may be of benefit in subclassification of the type of antithrombin deficiency and to confirm the decreased antithrombin level in patients with type I deficiency.",

Historically, these tumors have been categorized under various names, including epithelioid blue nevus, pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM) and animal-type melanoma. Although a subset of PEM harbor BRAF activating mutations and biallelic inactivation of PRKAR1A, there are only a few reports of melanomas, or of tumors with genomic alterations beyond those of PEMs. Herein, we describe the clinicopathologic and genetic features of 8 melanomas and tumors that lack PRKAR1α expression by immunohistochemistry but do not fit with conventional PRKAR1A-inactivated melanocytomas. These tumors tended to affect younger patients than conventional melanomas (median age=38 y) and presented as dark brown/black papules and nodules. Histopathologically, they demonstrated nodularity, sometimes in a background of conventional melanoma, and large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. With the exception of 1 case, the mitotic index was not significantly elevated. Immunohistochemically, all cases showed loss of PRKAR1α and of p16 expression. Seven tumors underwent massively parallel short read (next-generation) sequencing of a panel of 480 cancer-associated genes. Five tumors demonstrated truncating mutations of PRKAR1A and the 2 in which such mutations were not identified demonstrated loss of heterozygosity of the PRKAR1A locus. Four of the tumors harbored BRAF V600E mutations, and 1 harbored a FAM39B-BRAF gene fusion. Another harbored a GNA11 activating mutation. A MAP kinase activating mutation was not identified in the remaining case. Four tumors displayed TERT promoter mutations and chromosomal copy number changes supporting the diagnosis of melanoma. Two cases without these alterations and were classified as ""high-grade PRKAR1A-inactivated melanocytomas"". The 1 case with widespread metastases demonstrated mutations in TP53 and RB1. Overall, we provide the first genetic characterization of PRKAR1A-inactivated melanomas, discuss the differential diagnosis of heavily pigmented epithelioid melanocytic neoplasms, and propose a new nomenclature for such tumors.",

They also represent a paradigmatic arena to study the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying suicidality because they are emblematic of the heterogeneity and complexity of mutual interrelationships characterizing this issue. On the one hand, neurological diseases imply strictly biological impairments that are postulated to be the basis of vulnerability to suicide or result in the need for treatments for which a suicidal risk has been hypothesized. On the other hand, they question some subjective experiences of neurological patients, up to near existential positions. Often, in fact, they are accompanied by severe hopelessness. The latter may originate in, particularly for the most severe neurological diseases, the absence of curative treatments, unpredictable disease progression that leads to acute relapses or chronicity, a decrease in autonomy or selfidentity, progressive social isolation, a sense of becoming useless, and perception of feeling stigmatized. This may ultimately cause a slip into experiencing an absurd condition. At the confluence of neurobiology and hopelessness, frequent psychiatric comorbidities may play a primary role.

This review will discuss the standard application, novel imaging modalities and their additive role in patients with bladder cancer. Staging can be performed with CT, but distinguishing between T1 and T2 BCa (bladder cancer) cannot be assessed. MRI can distinguish muscle-invasive from non-muscle-invasive tumors with accurate local staging.

We examined innate and adaptive immune responses in SAPHO syndrome, as compared with PsA and RA. We also studied the effect of etanercept on immunological parameters.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied 29 patients with SAPHO syndrome, as well as 22 patients with RA, 21 patients with PsA and 15 healthy controls. Adaptive immune responses were investigated by assaying total serum immunoglobulins and several autoantibodies. Innate immunity was studied by quantifying blood PMN functions and plasma cytokine levels. PMN responses to Propionibacterium acnes were tested ex vivo. Eight patients who received etanercept for refractory rheumatic disorders were tested before and after 28 days of treatment.<h4>Results</h4>SAPHO syndrome was associated with elevated IL-8 and IL-18 plasma levels. IL-8 and TNF-alpha production by purified PMN was higher in the three patient groups than in the healthy controls, but the oxidative burst and IL-18 production were normal. No autoantibodies were detected in SAPHO patients. Induction of PMN IL-8 and TNF-alpha production by P. acnes was impaired in the SAPHO group as compared with the RA and PsA groups. After 28 days of etanercept therapy, PMN IL-8 and TNF-alpha production was down-regulated and TNF-alpha plasma levels were increased.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results support the view that the SAPHO syndrome may be triggered by an infectious state involving P. acnes, contributing to the strong humoral and cellular pro-inflammatory responses. Etanercept modulation of PMN activation status emphasizes these new immunological findings.",

A naturally occurring alternative splice event between zinc fingers three and four, removing or retaining three amino acids (±KTS), is believed to change the DNA binding affinity of WT1, although there are conflicting data regarding the binding affinity and motifs of the different isoforms. Increased expression of the WT1 -KTS isoform at the expense of the WT1 +KTS isoform is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. We determined the genome-wide binding pattern of WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS in leukemic K562 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. We discovered that the WT1 -KTS isoform predominantly binds close to transcription start sites and to enhancers, in a similar fashion to other transcription factors, whereas WT1 +KTS binding is enriched within gene bodies. We observed a significant overlap between WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes, despite the binding sites being distinct. Motif discovery revealed distinct binding motifs for the isoforms, some of which have been previously reported as WT1 binding sites. Additional analyses showed that both WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes are more likely to be transcribed than non-targets, and are involved in cell proliferation, cell death, and development. Our study provides evidence that WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS share target genes yet still bind distinct locations, indicating isoform-specific regulation in transcription of genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation, consistent with the involvement of WT1 in acute myeloid leukemia.",

The virus exists in two biotypes, cytopathic and non-cytopathic, depending on the effect of the viruses on cultured cells. BVDV may cause transient and persistent infections which differ fundamentally in the host's antiviral immune response. Transient infection may be due to both cytopathic and non-cytopathic biotypes of BVDV and leads to a specific immune response. In contrast, only non-cytopathic BVD viruses can establish persistent infection as a result of infection of the embryo early in its development. Persistent infection is characterized by immunotolerance specific for the infecting viral strain. In this paper we discuss the role of innate immune responses in the two types of infection. In general, both transient and persistent infections are associated with an increased frequency of secondary infections. Associated with the increased risk of such infections are, among others, impaired bacteria killing and decreased chemotaxis. Interestingly, non-cytopathic BVDV fails to induce interferon type I in cultured bovine macrophages whereas cytopathic biotypes readily trigger this response. Cells infected with non-cytopathic BVDV are also resistant to induction of interferon by double stranded RNA, a potent interferon inducer signalling the presence of viral replication in the cell. Thus, non-cytopathic BVDV may dispose of a mechanism suppressing a key element of the antiviral defence of the innate immune system. Since interferon is also important in the activation of the adaptive immune response, suppression of this signal may be essential for the establishment of persistent infection and immunotolerance.",

Continuous renal replacement therapy for the treatment of metformin-associated lactic acidosis has been documented in some case reports; however, there is currently no specific treatment for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 70-year-old Japanese woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to an emergency room with metformin-associated lactic acidosis. She was found to be hypotensive and laboratory examinations revealed severe lactic acidosis: pH 6.618, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood 17.3 mmHg, bicarbonate 1.7 mmol/L, and lactate 18 mmol/L. Severe acidemia persisted despite supportive care including intravenously administered fluids, sodium bicarbonate, antibiotics, and vasopressors. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated in our intensive care unit. After dialysis for 3 days, her lactate level and pH value completely normalized. The concentration of metformin detected was 77.5 mg/L, which is one of the highest in metformin-associated lactic acidosis successfully treated without overdose.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present case had one of the highest metformin concentrations in metformin-associated lactic acidosis successfully treated with continuous renal replacement therapy, and serum metformin concentrations may be useful for the diagnosis of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare but important etiology of lactic acidosis. Continuous renal replacement therapy is advantageous for the treatment of hemodynamically unstable patients with metformin-associated lactic acidosis.",https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13256-019-2311-5

We monitored total serum testosterone and prostate specific antigen every 28 days beginning 90 days after the last depot LH-RH agonist injection. Data were analyzed with castrate testosterone defined as less than 50 and 20 ng./dl. or less.<h4>Results</h4>Using the 50 and 20 ng./dl. definitions of castrate testosterone 2 (5%) and 5 (13%) of the 38 men, respectively, failed to achieve castrate testosterone. A patient with a nadir testosterone of 70 ng./dl. subsequently underwent orchiectomy and testosterone decreased to 10 ng./dl. thereafter.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A small but potentially important subgroup of men on depot LH-RH agonist therapy fail to achieve a castrate level of testosterone. Our findings support monitoring testicular response when LH-RH agonist therapy is initiated.",

To examine this association and to establish a suitable cut-off value for AUC24/MIC, a multicentre prospective observational study was conducted in patients with MRSA bacteraemia. Data were collected on all patients aged ≥18 years with MRSA bacteraemia treated with vancomycin for ≥72 h without dialysis. The MIC was determined by broth microdilution (BMD) and Etest. Treatment failure was defined as (i) 30-day mortality, (ii) persistent bacteraemia (≥7 days) and (iii) recurrence (≤30 days after completion of therapy). AUC24 was estimated by a Bayesian approach based on individual vancomycin concentrations. The AUC24/MIC cut-off value for differentiating treatment success and failure was calculated by Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. In total, 117 patients were enrolled, among which vancomycin treatment failure occurred in 38 (32.5%). In univariate analysis, high vancomycin MIC and low trough levels were unrelated to treatment outcomes. In the CART analysis, low vancomycin AUC24/MIC [<392.7 (BMD) and <397.2 (Etest)] was associated with treatment failure. In multivariate analysis, low AUC24/MIC was a risk factor for treatment failure [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-8.82 by BMD; aOR=5.61, 95% CI 2.07-15.24 by Etest]. AUC24/MIC is associated with vancomycin treatment outcomes in MRSA bacteraemia, and seeking individualised AUC24/MIC ratios above target (>400) may improve treatment outcomes.",

Gestational age ranged between 19 and 39 weeks. Fetuses with isolated CHD without non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) (Group A, n = 89) were separated from seven fetuses showing isolated CHD with NIHF (Group B) and 50 cases complicated by chromosomal or other extracardiac malformations, intrauterine growth restriction or non-cardiogenic NIHF (Group C). The control group comprised 109 healthy fetuses of uncomplicated pregnancies. Individual peak velocity index for veins (PVIV) measurements were converted into their Z-scores (delta values) for statistical analysis.<h4>Results</h4>There was no statistical difference between fetuses with isolated CHD (Group A) and controls, for the delta PVIV of neither the ductus venosus nor the inferior vena cava. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between non-isolated CHD fetuses (Group C) and controls for both vessels. However, in a separate analysis of isolated right heart malformations compared with the remaining isolated heart malformations (Groups A and B), a significant difference was observed for the ductus venosus, but not the inferior vena cava. There was an overall survival of 62%. In Group A, 58% of fetuses survived despite increased PVIV and 22% of fetuses with normal venous Doppler had an adverse outcome. All fetuses with cardiogenic NIHF (Group B) died.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Doppler studies of the ductus venosus and inferior vena cava in fetuses with isolated CHD do not present sufficient alterations to be a reliable marker for screening purposes for CHD in mid-second- and third-trimester fetuses. Furthermore, venous Doppler did not predict fetal outcome in cases of isolated CHD. Abnormal venous Doppler results were mainly attributable to myocardial dysfunction and also to severe right heart obstruction even in the absence of congestive heart failure. Therefore, venous Doppler studies are clinically helpful in indirectly monitoring cardiac function in fetuses with cardiac malformations.",

A total of 225 patients were enrolled: 33 in dose escalation and 192 in tumor-specific cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue. The maximum tolerated dose was 200 mg every 12 hours. The most common possibly related treatment-emergent adverse events involved fatigue and the gastrointestinal, renal, or hematopoietic systems. Plasma concentrations increased with dose, and pharmacodynamic effects were observed in proliferating keratinocytes and tumors. Radiographic responses were achieved in previously treated patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. For hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, the overall response rate was 31%; moreover, 61% of patients achieved either response or stable disease lasting ≥6 months.<h4>Significance</h4>Abemaciclib represents the first selective inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 with a safety profile allowing continuous dosing to achieve sustained target inhibition.

232,23482340,Fertility after ectopic pregnancy: the DEMETER randomized trial.,10.1093/humrep/det037,"Fernandez H, Capmas P, Lucot JP, Resch B, Panel P, Bouyer J, GROG.",2013,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","<h4>Study question</h4>Does treatment for the resolution of ectopic pregnancy (EP) affect subsequent spontaneous fertility [occurrence of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)]?<h4>Summary answer</h4>There is no significant difference in 2 years subsequent fertility neither between methotrexate and conservative surgery for less active EP nor between conservative and radical surgery for the most active EP.<h4>What is known already</h4>No randomized trial has compared radical and conservative surgery treatments. A recent review of the Cochrane database did not conclude about fertility due to insufficient data. Prospective studies from EP registries in two regions of France (Auvergne and Greater Lille) have suggested that fertility is similar after medical treatment and conservative surgery and lower after radical surgery.<h4>Study design, size, duration</h4>This randomized controlled trial included all women with an ultrasound-confirmed EP. Women were divided into two arms according to the activity of the EP (defined by Fernandez's score). In arm 1 (less active ectopic pregnancies, i.e. Fernandez's score <13 and no haemodynamic failure), medical treatment was considered practicable, and women were randomly allocated to conservative surgery with a systematic post-operative i.m. methotrexate injection within 24 h or to an i.m. methotrexate injection alone. In arm 2 (active ectopic pregnancies), medical treatment was considered impracticable, and, thus, all women had to undergo surgery; they were randomly allocated to either a radical or conservative procedure, the latter including a post-operative methotrexate injection. Sample sizes (n = 210 in arm 1 and n = 230 in arm 2) were computed to provide a statistical power of 80% to detect a 20% difference in subsequent cumulative fertility rates between treatments in each arm. The total duration of the trial was 5 years.<h4>Participants/materials, settings, methods</h4>The trial took place in 17 centres in France from 2005 to 2009. Two hundred and seven women were included in arm 1 and 199 in arm 2. Cumulative fertility curves were drawn with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed with the Cox model. Analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.<h4>Main results</h4>Arm 1: cumulative fertility curves were not significantly different between medical treatment and conservative surgery. HR was 0.85 (0.59-1.22) P = 0.37. The 2-year rates of IUP were 67% after medical treatment and 71% after conservative surgery. Arm 2: cumulative fertility curves were not significantly different between conservative and radical surgery. HR was 1.06 (0.69-1.63) P = 0.78. The 2-year rates of IUP were 70% after conservative surgery and 64% after radical surgery.<h4>Limitations, reasons for caution</h4>Inclusion in this trial was more difficult than expected, especially in arm 2 in which women were reluctant to radical surgery. In consequence, the sample size was slightly lower than planned. However, due to a lower proportion of lost to follow-up than expected (10% instead of 15%), the statistical power remained very close to 80%.<h4>Wider implications of the findings</h4>As it is a multicentre randomized trial, the results may be generalized with satisfactory confidence. The results of this trial invite gynaecologists to reconsider the management of EP and to modify balance between considerations of initial recovery and preservation of fertility.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>NCT00137982 on the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.",

Published series mainly focus on wide excision, which can be difficult at some sites (e.g., face) and in patients with comorbidities. In British Columbia, an approach of conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy is common.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This is a retrospective review of 179 patients treated for MCC with curative intent in British Columbia.<h4>Results</h4>Totals of 68, 63, and 37 patients underwent narrow excision of primary, attempted wide excision, and biopsy only, respectively. Adjuvant radiotherapy reduced local recurrence after narrow excision (<10 mm margin) from 25 to 4.9 % (p = .03) and was effective in the presence of microscopic positive margins. Local recurrence rate was 7.1 % if the margin was >10 mm irrespective of radiation use. Local RFS was improved by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) (p = 0.04), and there was a trend to reduced nodal relapse after elective nodal RT (p = .07). Irradiation of macroscopic tumor at 37 primary and 33 nodal sites provided 5-year local and nodal RFS of 90 and 75 %, respectively. The 5-year cancer specific survival was 77 % and was not improved by the use of adjuvant radiotherapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Local excision plus adjuvant RT is an effective treatment for MCC. Adjuvant radiation should be considered when the excision margin is <1 cm.",

Clinical manifestations are gynecomastia and/or other hypogonadism features in adults. They are rarer in pediatric population and their main manifestation is peripheral sexual precocity. In women genital bleeding, uterus hypertrophy, high blood pressure and/or abdomen mass may be the only manifestations. On the biological point, estrogen overproduction with or without increase in other adrenal hormones are the main abnormalities. Radiological examination usually shows the tumor, describes its limits and its eventual metastases. Adrenal and endocrine origins are confirmed by biochemical assessments and histology, but that one is unable to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, except if metastases are already present. Immunostaining using anti-aromatase antibodies is the only tool that distinguishes FAT from other adrenocortical tumors. Abdominal surgery is the best and the first line treatment. For large tumors (≥10 cm), an open access is preferred to coeliosurgery, but for the small ones, or when the surgeon is experienced, endoscopic surgery seems to give excellent results. Surgery can be preceded by adrenolytic agents such as ortho paraprime dichloro diphenyl dichloroethane (Mitotane), ketoconazole or by aromatase inhibitors, but till now there is not any controlled study to compare the benefit of different drugs. New anti-estrogens can be used too, but their results need to be confirmed in malignant tumors resistant to classical chemotherapy and to conventional radiotherapy. Targeted therapy can be used too, as in other adrenocortical tumors, but the results need to be confirmed.",

The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) comprises a unique medical consortium that covers a complete population of all ages in a well-defined geographic region over the past half-century. The objective of this study was to characterize the incidence of sporadic VS over this extended period. Study Design Population-based study. Setting Olmsted County, Minnesota. Subjects and Methods Review of all VSs diagnosed between January 1, 1966, and December 31, 2016, was conducted with the REP medical records linkage system. Results A total of 153 incident cases of VS were identified. The incidence of VS significantly increased over the past half-century from 1.5 per 100,000 person-years during the first decade to 4.2 in the last decade ( P < .001). Incidence increased with age ( P < .001): those aged ≥70 years exhibited the highest incidence rate at 18.3 per 100,000 person-years in the last decade. Age at diagnosis significantly increased from a median of 52 years in the first decade to 62 years in the last ( P < .001). Despite presenting with fewer symptoms and smaller tumors, the time delay between symptom onset and diagnosis significantly decreased over the past 5 decades (all P < .05). Almost 1 in 4 patients was diagnosed incidentally in the last decade. Conclusion The incidence of VS increased significantly over the past half-century to a rate greater than previously reported.

The study objective is to investigate its survival outcomes, incidence of brain metastases, and patterns of recurrence.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a single center study of patients with pathologic diagnosis of pulmonary LCNEC. Patient data were collected retrospectively and analyzed, including survival, incidence of brain metastases, and patterns of recurrence.<h4>Results</h4>Of 87 patients (stages I: 24, II: 14, III: 23, IV: 26), 52 were managed curatively and 35 palliatively. The median follow-up time was 17.3 months (range 0.6-89.5) for those treated with curative intent and 7.0 months (range 0.1-28.6) for those treated palliatively. The 2- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates are 48.4% and 25.5% for the curative group, with a median OS of 13.5 months. In the palliative group, the OS are 30.8% at 1 year and 6.8% at 2 years, with a median OS of 7.0 months. Thirty-eight of 52 (73%) patients treated with curative intent had disease relapse, with the common sites being regional lymph nodes (20), brain (18), bones (11), and liver (9). The incidence of brain recurrence among those managed curatively are 21.4% and 41.3%, respectively at 1 and 2 years.

The mechanisms for this complication are unclear. The aim of this study was to describe patient characteristics and clarify the mechanisms involved.<h4>Methods</h4>Liver specimens from 12 patients (median age, 24 years; median body mass index, 11.3 kg/m(2)), with a prothrombin index <50% and/or an International Normalized Ratio >1.7 and anorexia nervosa as the only cause for acute liver injury were analyzed. A detailed pathologic examination was performed, including under electron microscopy.<h4>Results</h4>Liver cell glycogen depletion was a constant finding. There was a contrast between the increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (56 times normal on average; 1,904 IU/L) and the absence of significant hepatocyte necrosis on histology. Centrilobular changes (trabecular atrophy and/or sinusoidal fibrosis) were observed in 6 patients. There were rare or no (<5%) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive hepatocytes, suggesting that apoptosis was not the primary mechanism. Hepatocytes from 4 patients showed numerous autophagosomes, a morphologic hallmark of autophagy, on electron microscopy. In contrast, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei were normal in most cells. These features were absent in 11 control patients. The outcome was favorable in all patients, with a rapid return to normal liver function.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Anorexia nervosa with extremely poor nutritional status should be added to the list of conditions causing acute liver insufficiency. Our findings show that starvation-induced autophagy in the human liver may be involved in liver cell death during anorexia nervosa, even though other mechanisms of liver cell damage could also play a role.",

All patients showed tumor control in a median follow-up period of 75 months after the second radiosurgical procedure. Volumetric tumor response after the second procedure did not correspond to response after the first procedure. After retreatment, persisting House-Brackmann Grade II facial nerve dysfunction was observed in 3 patients (7.9%), facial spasms in 5 patients (13%), and trigeminal nerve hypesthesia in 3 patients (7.9%). Hearing preservation was not evaluated because of the small number of patients with serviceable hearing at the second procedure. CONCLUSIONS Repeat GKRS after a failed first treatment appears to be an effective strategy in terms of tumor control. The volumetric response after a repeat procedure could not be predicted by the volumetric response observed after first treatment. This justifies considering repeat GKRS even for tumors that do not show any volumetric response and show continuous growth after first treatment. An increased risk of mild facial and trigeminal nerve dysfunction was observed after the second treatment compared with the first treatment.",

Fifty-eight cases (14%) were found and were analyzed for histologic nature of tumor, anatomic location, symptomatology and complications. The most common histologic type of lung tumor causing gastrointestinal tract metastasis was squamous cell (19 cases, 33%), followed by large cell (17 cases, 29%), and oat cell (11 cases, 19%). The esophagus was the most common site of involvement (33 cases). Fourteen of the 33 cases were involved by direct extension of the tumor. The middle third of the esophagus had metastases more commonly (16/33, 49%) than the other two sites. Most patients with gastrointestinal metastases had no symptoms. In those patients with symptoms, dysphagia was most common when the tumor involved the proximal gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach), whereas, pain was most commonly seen with involvement of the distal gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, large bowel). Six of 20 patients (30%) with small bowel involvement experienced perforation and peritonitis as complications of metastatic involvement and two patients with large bowel metastasis had obstruction; a third had dehiscence of a previous anastomotic site. Gastrointestinal tract metastases from primary carcinoma of the lung are more common than previously thought and may be associated with serious clinical complications.",

Some of the original patients had features resembling myofibrillar myopathy (MFM), arguing that TTN mutations could be a much more common cause of inherited muscle disease, especially in presence of early respiratory involvement.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied 127 undiagnosed patients with clinical presentation compatible with MFM. Sanger sequencing for the two previously described TTN mutations in HMERF (p.C30071R in the 119th fibronectin-3 (FN3) domain, and p.R32450W in the kinase domain) was performed in all patients. Patients with mutations had detailed review of their clinical records, muscle MRI findings and muscle pathology.<h4>Results</h4>We identified five new families with the p.C30071R mutation who were clinically similar to previously reported cases, and muscle pathology demonstrated diagnostic features of MFM. Two further families had novel variants in the 119th FN3 domain (p.P30091L and p.N30145K). No patients were identified with mutations at position p.32450.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Mutations in TTN are a cause of MFM, and titinopathy is more common than previously thought. The finding of the p.C30071R mutation in 3.9% of our study population is likely due to a British founder effect. The occurrence of novel FN3 domain variants, although still of uncertain pathogenicity, suggests that other mutations in this domain may cause MFM, and that the disease is likely to be globally distributed. We suggest that HMERF due to mutations in the TTN gene be nosologically classified as MFM-titinopathy.",

An international phase Ib/II study evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of venetoclax, a selective B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 inhibitor, together with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in older adults with AML.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Adults 60 years or older with previously untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy were enrolled. Prior treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, including hypomethylating agents (HMA), was permitted. Eighty-two patients were treated at the recommended phase II dose: venetoclax 600 mg per day orally in 28-day cycles, with LDAC (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day) administered subcutaneously on days 1 to 10. Key end points were tolerability, safety, response rates, duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS).<h4>Results</h4>Median age was 74 years (range, 63 to 90 years), 49% had secondary AML, 29% had prior HMA treatment, and 32% had poor-risk cytogenetic features. Common grade 3 or greater adverse events were febrile neutropenia (42%), thrombocytopenia (38%), and WBC count decreased (34%). Early (30-day) mortality was 6%. Fifty-four percent achieved complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (median time to first response, 1.4 months). The median OS was 10.1 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 14.2), and median DOR was 8.1 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 14.9 months). Among patients without prior HMA exposure, CR/CR with incomplete blood count recovery was achieved in 62%, median DOR was 14.8 months (95% CI, 5.5 months to not reached), and median OS was 13.5 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 18.4 months).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Venetoclax plus LDAC has a manageable safety profile, producing rapid and durable remissions in older adults with AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. High remission rate and low early mortality combined with rapid and durable remission make venetoclax and LDAC an attractive and novel treatment for older adults not suitable for intensive chemotherapy.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6524989?pdf=render

This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis. The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), which has shown clinical efficacy in some BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers. However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X(L) inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent.

Systematic literature reviews were conducted for each PICO question. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. Recommendations were developed by the Voting Panel, comprising adult and pediatric rheumatologists and patients. Each recommendation required ≥70% consensus among the Voting Panel.<h4>Results</h4>We present 22 recommendations and 2 ungraded position statements for GCA, and 20 recommendations and 1 ungraded position statement for TAK. These recommendations and statements address clinical questions relating to the use of diagnostic testing, including imaging, treatments, and surgical interventions in GCA and TAK. Recommendations for GCA include support for the use of glucocorticoid-sparing immunosuppressive agents and the use of imaging to identify large vessel involvement. Recommendations for TAK include the use of nonglucocorticoid immunosuppressive agents with glucocorticoids as initial therapy. There were only 2 strong recommendations; the remaining recommendations were conditional due to the low quality of evidence available for most PICO questions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These recommendations provide guidance regarding the evaluation and management of patients with GCA and TAK, including diagnostic strategies, use of pharmacologic agents, and surgical interventions.",

For all the breeds except the boxer, there was a trend for dogs with cardiac disease (but not respiratory disease) to have higher mean values on the scale than normal dogs of the same breed; however, at the optimal value of the scale for distinguishing between dogs of each breed with and without cardiac disease, the sensitivity and specificity were relatively low, in the range 58 to 83 per cent. The scale was most accurate for the diagnosis of cardiac disease in the Yorkshire terrier and the cavalier King Charles spaniel, breeds affected by predominantly dilative forms of cardiac disease.

Nephrology,"Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred treatment for acute kidney injury (AKI) in intensive care units (ICUs) throughout much of the developed world. Despite its widespread use, however, no formal proof exists that patient outcomes are improved when CRRT is used in preference to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). In addition, controversy and center-specific practice variation in the clinical application of CRRT continues, owing to a lack of randomized multicenter studies of both CRRT and IHD providing level 1 data to inform clinical practice. Now, however, the publication of results from the Veterans Affairs/National Institutes of Health Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) study and the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level Renal Replacement Therapy (RENAL) trial have provided an unparalleled quantity of information to guide clinicians. These pivotal trials investigated different intensities of CRRT in the ICU and provided level 1 evidence that effluent flow rates >25 ml/kg per hour do not improve outcomes in patients in the ICU. In this Review, we discuss the background and results of the ATN and RENAL trials and the emerging consensus that CRRT is the most appropriate treatment for AKI in vasopressor-dependent patients in the ICU. Finally, we describe the remaining controversies regarding the use of CRRT and the questions that remain to be answered.",

However, with the complex nature of most procedures, patients and staff bare an increased radiation exposure. Near-zero or zero-fluoroscopy CA is an alternative method which could substantially reduce or even eliminate the radiation dose. Our aim was to analyse procedural outcomes with fluoroscopy minimising approach for treatment of VAs in patients with structurally normal hearts (SNH) and structural heart disease (SHD).<h4>Methods</h4>Fifty-two (age 53.4 ± 17.8 years, 38 male, 14 female) consecutive patients who underwent CA of VAs in our institution between May 2018 and December 2019 were included. Procedures were performed primarily with the aid of the three-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping system and intra-cardiac echocardiography. Fluoroscopy was considered only in left ventricular (LV) summit mapping for coronary angiography and when epicardial approach was planned. Acute and long-term procedural outcomes were analysed.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty CA procedures were performed. Twenty-five patients had SHD-related VAs (Group 1) and 27 patients had SNH (Group 2). While Group 1 had significantly higher total procedural time (256.9 ± 71.7 vs 123.6 ± 42.2 min; p < 0.001) compared to Group 2, overall procedural success rate [77.4% (24/31) vs 89.7% (26/29); p = 0.20)] and recurrence rate after the first procedure [8/25, (32%) vs 8/27, (29.6%); p = 0.85] were similar in both groups. Fluoroscopy was used in 3 procedures in Group 1 where epicardial approach was needed and in 4 procedures in Group 2 where LV summit VAs were ablated. Overall procedure-related major complication rate was 5%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Fluoroscopy minimising approach for CA of VAs is feasible and safe in patients with SHD and SNH. Fluoroscopy could not be completely abolished in VAs with epicardial and LV summit substrate location.",https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12872-021-02120-4

After a successful and uneventful septorhinoplasty, she required numerous hospital admissions due to multiple episodes of blunt nasal trauma, culminating in clear nasal discharge and neurological symptoms, including dizziness, right-sided paresthesia and difficulty walking. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was ruled out by CT brain; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord showed demyelinating areas in the brain and cervical region of the spinal cord. CSF examination revealed the presence of oligoclonal bands. A neurologist confirmed the diagnosis of MS and initiated treatment, which was well tolerated. The patient is in remission with mild paresthesia in the right hand. Despite the repeated nasal trauma, the septorhinoplasty procedure had an excellent outcome. In conclusion, repeated nasal trauma, especially in the early postoperative period, in addition to procedure failure, may also point to the presence of an uncommon underlying neurological disorder, hitherto undiagnosed. It is therefore important to have an open mind when it comes to the differential diagnosis in such unusual scenarios.

Although primary dysfunction of the auditory nerve is intuitively logical, available histopathologic and clinical data suggest that although neural degeneration is common, it alone does not adequately account for hearing loss in many cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 11 cases of unoperated unilateral acoustic neuromas. Temporal bones were identified by means of a search mechanism provided by the National Temporal Bone, Hearing, and Balance Pathology Resource Registry and were prepared for light microscopy by standard techniques. Quantification of spiral ganglion cells, hair cells, stria vascularis, and spiral ligament was accomplished for each specimen. In addition, the maximum diameter and volume of each tumor were calculated from histopathologic sections. Increasing tumor size did predict a reduced spiral ganglion count. However, although there was a tendency for decreasing spiral ganglion cell count and for increasing tumor size to predict a higher pure tone average and lower speech discrimination score, these correlations did not reach statistical significance. In tumor ears in which the speech discrimination score was 50% or less, there was always significant degeneration of other structures of the inner ear in addition to neurons, including hair cells, the stria vascularis, and the spiral ligament. Endolymphatic hydrops and eosinophilic precipitate in the perilymphatic spaces were found in 2 of 3 such cases. It is concluded that acoustic neuromas appear to cause hearing loss, not only by causing degeneration of the auditory nerve, but also by inducing degenerative changes in the inner ear. It is hypothesized that the proteinaceous material seen histologically may represent the products of up-regulated genes in acoustic neuroma, some of which may interfere with normal cochlear function.",

A subgroup analysis screening all surgical series published within the last 20 years (January 2000 to March 2020) was performed. Weighted summary rates for tumor resection, oncological control, and facial nerve preservation were determined using meta-analysis models. This data along with contemporary practice patterns were discussed within the task force to generate consensual recommendations regarding preoperative evaluations, optimal surgical strategy, and follow-up management.<h4>Results</h4>Tumor classification grades should be systematically used in the perioperative management of patients, with large vestibular schwannomas (VS) defined as > 30 mm in the largest extrameatal diameter. Grading scales for pre- and postoperative hearing (AAO-HNS or GR) and facial nerve function (HB) are to be used for reporting functional outcome. There is a lack of consensus to support the superiority of any surgical strategy with respect to extent of resection and use of adjuvant radiosurgery. Intraoperative neuromonitoring needs to be routinely used to preserve neural function. Recommendations for postoperative clinico-radiological evaluations have been elucidated based on the surgical strategy employed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The main goal of management of large vestibular schwannomas should focus on maintaining/improving quality of life (QoL), making every attempt at facial/cochlear nerve functional preservation while ensuring optimal oncological control, thereby allowing to meet patient expectations. Despite the fact that this analysis yielded only a few Class B evidences and mostly expert opinions, it will guide practitioners to manage these patients and form the basis for future clinical trials.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00701-020-04491-7.pdf

Medical history was notable for stage 1a endometrial carcinoma status post treatment with radiotherapy alone. The patient was not considered a candidate for surgical intervention at the time due to multiple underlying comorbidities. Colonoscopy revealed a 4 cm, nonobstructive, friable, and ulcerated mass in the sigmoid colon. Initially this was concerning for a primary colorectal carcinoma, although immunohistochemistry revealed a uterine endometrial origin of the lesion. A total hysterectomy was eventually performed along with surgical resection of the affected segment of the colon, which was followed by radiation therapy. This case illustrates an unusual site of metastasis for endometrial carcinoma. The colonic metastasis of endometrial adenocarcinoma is reported to be rare and unusual, especially in the absence of endometriosis. Immunohistochemistry staining is an important adjunct in distinguishing the diagnosis of endometrial adenocarcinoma from primary colorectal carcinomas. Primary colon cancers are cytokeratin-7 negative and cytokeratin-20 positive, whereas endometrial cancers are cytokeratin-7 positive and cytokeratin-20 negative. This case is important given the scarcity and peculiarity of metastatic colon cancer originating from uterine adenocarcinomas.

To examine this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between plasma bilirubin concentrations and bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) promoter gene variations (associated with increased bilirubin concentrations) with total/CVD and cancer mortality.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A nested case-control study was conducted within the Polish arm of the HAPIEE cohort. At baseline in 2002-2005, participants were examined in detail. Mortality follow-up (median (IQR) between blood draw and death was 3.7 (2.1-5.1) years) was performed by linkage with regional and national death registers. Plasma biomarkers were analysed in all subjects who died from any cause (cases, n=447) and in a random subsample of survivors (controls, n=1423).<h4>Results</h4>There was a strong negative association between plasma bilirubin levels and total and cancer mortality, expressed more profoundly in men. The adjusted OR of deaths from all causes and cancer, comparing the highest vs. lowest plasma bilirubin categories were 0.61 (95% CI: 0.42-0.87) and 0.39 (0.24-0.65), respectively. There was no association of bilirubin with CVD mortality. The UGT1A1*28 allele, a genetic marker of raised bilirubin, was also negatively associated with total/cancer mortality, although the associations were not statistically significant.<h4>Discussion</h4>Both the observational and genetic associations support the negative relationship between bilirubin and total mortality; this association appears to be driven by cancer mortality, while that with CVD mortality is not evident.",

Primary patency after 24 months was 67% and secondary patency 83%. Fifteen of 19 patients had open stents at final follow-up. Re-interventions were performed in four patients and included catheter directed thrombolysis in all and adjunctive stenting in three. Thirteen of 19 patients (68%) reported a sustained and significant clinical improvement. Mean VCSS improved from 8.5 (range 3-25) at baseline to 7 (range 2-23) at final follow-up (p = .007). There were no peri-procedural or long-term complications.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The endovascular approach with stent placement for chronic IVC obstruction is a safe treatment option that should be offered to patients who otherwise have little opportunity for sustained clinical improvement.",

This disorder most often involves a pituitary adenoma. Occasionally it may be the first manifestation of an underlying adenoma. There is conflicting data regarding which type of pituitary adenoma is prone for apoplexy. Some studies showed predominance of non-functional adenomas while some other studies showed a higher prevalence in functioning adenomas amongst which prolactinoma have the highest risk. Although pituitary apoplexy can occur without any precipitating factor in most cases, there are some well recognizable risk factors such as hypertension, medications, major surgeries, coagulopathies either primary or following medications or infection, head injury, radiation or dynamic testing of the pituitary. Patients usually present with headache, vomiting, altered sensorium, visual defect and/or endocrine dysfunction. Hemodynamic instability may be result from adrenocorticotrophic hormone deficiency. Imaging with either CT scan or MRI should be performed in suspected cases. Intravenous fluid and hydrocortisone should be administered after collection of sample for baseline hormonal evaluation. Earlier studies used to advocate urgent decompression of the lesion but more recent studies favor conservative approach for most cases with surgery reserved for those with deteriorating level of consciousness or increasing visual defect. The visual and endocrine outcomes are almost similar with either surgery or conservative management. Once the acute phase is over, patient should be re-evaluated for hormonal deficiencies.",

Although a number of studies have characterized the DNA binding properties of the WT1 protein, recent evidence has suggested that WT1 may also have a role in RNA metabolism. We have used an RNA selection method to identify WT1 binding ligands from a random RNA pool. Three groups of RNA ligands specifically recognized by WT1 were identified. Mutational analysis pinpointed ribonucleotide sequences critical for binding. Analysis of truncated WT1 proteins demonstrated that three of four zinc fingers were necessary for RNA-protein interaction. The naturally occurring WT1 isoforms with insertion of lysine, threonine and serine between zinc fingers three and four were unable to bind the selected RNAs. The selected RNA ligands competed with the cognate WT1 DNA binding site for complex formation with WT1. Our findings suggest potential cellular RNA target sequences for WT1 and provide tools for studying the structural and functional properties of this tumour suppressor protein.",
319,32733360,A Practical Approach to Managing Patients With Myasthenia Gravis-Opinions and a Review of the Literature.,10.3389/fneur.2020.00604,"Farrugia ME, Goodfellow JA.",2020,Frontiers in neurology,"When the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG) has been secured, the aim of management should be prompt symptom control and the induction of remission or minimal manifestations. Symptom control, with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, is commonly employed. This may be sufficient in mild disease. There is no single universally accepted treatment regimen. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of immunosuppressive treatment in patients with more than mild MG to induce remission. Immunosuppressive therapies, such as azathioprine are prescribed in addition to but sometimes instead of corticosteroids when background comorbidities preclude or restrict the use of steroids. Rituximab has a role in refractory MG, while plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin therapy are commonly prescribed to treat MG crisis and in some cases of refractory MG. Data from the MGTX trial showed clear evidence that thymectomy is beneficial in patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive generalized MG, up to the age of 65 years. Minimally invasive thymectomy surgery including robotic-assisted thymectomy surgery has further revolutionized thymectomy and the management of MG. Ocular MG is not life-threatening but can be significantly disabling when diplopia is persistent. There is evidence to support early treatment with corticosteroids when ocular motility is abnormal and fails to respond to symptomatic treatment. Treatment needs to be individualized in the older age-group depending on specific comorbidities. In the younger age-groups, particularly in women, consideration must be given to the potential teratogenicity of certain therapies. Novel therapies are being developed and trialed, including ones that inhibit complement-induced immunological pathways or interfere with antibody-recycling pathways. Fatigue is common in MG and should be duly identified from fatigable weakness and managed with a combination of physical therapy with or without psychological support. MG patients may also develop dysfunctional breathing and the necessary respiratory physiotherapy techniques need to be implemented to alleviate the patient's symptoms of dyspnoea. In this review, we discuss various facets of myasthenia management in adults with ocular and generalized disease, including some practical approaches and our personal opinions based on our experience.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.00604/pdf

To assess the effectiveness of surgical treatment for this kind of patients we reviewed our experience.<h4>Methods</h4>From January 1989 to October 1999, 30 patients (26 males and four females; mean age: 58.7 years) with NSCLC and single brain metastasis underwent surgical treatment of both primary lung cancer and secondary cerebral lesion. Patients (pts) were divided into two major groups. In group 1 (G1) 20 pts (18 males and two females) presented a synchronous brain metastasis. In group 2 (G2) 10 pts (eight males and two females) presented a metachronous brain metastasis during the follow-up period (range 3-24 months since the primary tumor). Patients selected in G1 had T1-2, N0-1 clinical staging, good 'performance status' (ECOG:0--1; Karnofsky index > 70%), age < 75 years. Craniotomy has always been the first approach. In G2 also patients with locally advanced tumors (T3 and/or N2) were included. Whole brain radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy was the post-operative choice treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Histologic findings have shown: adenocarcinoma in 17 cases (12 in G1; five in G2), squamous cell carcinoma in 10 cases (six in G1; four in G2), large cell carcinoma in 2 (one in G1; one in G2) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in one (G1). Survival analysis (Kaplan--Meier method) has shown an overall value of 80% at 1 year (95% in G1; 50% in G2), 41% at 2 years (47% in G1; 30% in G2) and 17% at 3 years (14% in G1; 20% in G2). Overall median survival is 23 months (23 in G1; 11 in G2); mean survival 27.8 months (30.3 months in G1; 22.8 months in G2). According to univariate analysis prognosis is definitively better in N0 tumors compared to N1-2 tumors and in adenocarcinoma cases compared to other histotypes (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>We can conclude that combined surgical therapy is, nowadays, the choice treatment for this kind of patients, even though restricted to selected cases. The knowledge of prognostic factors may optimize indications for surgery.",

Supplement,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The number of microsurgical clippings of cerebral aneurysms is continuously decreasing. This will lead to fewer possibilities for practical training in aneurysm surgery, especially for the younger generation. Accordingly, realistic models for microsurgical training are mandatory.<h4>Methods</h4>We present a microsurgical setup for training on a PVC rat and on a lifelike vascular training model with specific plastic vessels (PVA), and an anatomical head as well as an experimental animal model (rabbit carotid artery bifurcation model). End-to-end and end-to-side anastomoses were performed with three different levels of difficulty and three different levels of expertise on the PVC rat model. The results of the animal bifurcation aneurysm model are also described.<h4>Results</h4>With increasing surgical complexity, the duration of surgery and rate of incorrect sutures of the vessel wall rise significantly. The overall patency rate of anastomosis is clearly reduced in the setup with increasing complexity grades.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The PVC rat model as well as the PVA vascular kit with realistic skull and craniotomy sites is a perfect tool for advanced microvascular anastomosis training. The experimental animal model represents a higher level of vascular surgery expertise and additionally is a perfect model for practicing appropriate clip application and clip occlusion of aneurysms.",

The aim of this study was to comprehensively elaborate the clinicopathological and molecular features of this rare malignancy.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients who were diagnosed with carcinosarcoma of the pancreas were retrospectively identified from pathology database of a single institution between 2012 and 2018.<h4>Results</h4>A total of nine patients were identified. Pathological examination of tumor tissues from included patients showed coexisting carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. These two components were distinguished by mutually exclusive expression of cytokeratin and vimentin. The sarcomatous tissue exhibited more extensive proliferation, as revealed by Ki67 staining, and necrosis compared with the carcinomatous counterpart. Genomic analysis of tumor tissues for two patients demonstrated hotspot mutation at KRAS and TP53. Carcinomatous and sarcomatous components were separately obtained via laser captured microdissection in one patient, and mutations of driving genes were highly concordant between them. Besides, immunostaining of frequently-altered tumor suppressor genes for these two components suggested consistent expression patterns. The median overall survival for six patients with adequate follow-up was 14 months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Carcinosarcoma of the pancreas represent a rare malignancy with distinct histological characteristics. Genomic and molecular analysis suggested monoclonal origin of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components.",

The YGTSS and CGI-I were rated by clinicians blind to treatment assignment. We examined the percent reduction in the YGTSS-Total Tic Score (TTS) against Much Improved or Very Much Improved on the CGI-I, computed a signal detection analysis (SDA) and built a mixture model to classify dimensional response based on the change in the YGTSS-TTS.<h4>Results</h4>A 25% decrease on the YGTSS-TTS predicted positive response on the CGI-I during the trial. The SDA showed that a 25% reduction in the YGTSS-TTS provided optimal sensitivity (87%) and specificity (84%) for predicting positive response. Using a mixture model without consideration of the CGI-I, the dimensional response was defined by 23% (or greater) reduction on the YGTSS-TTS. The odds ratio (OR) of positive response (OR=5.68, 95% CI=[2.99, 10.78]) on the CGI-I for behavioral intervention was greater than the dimensional response (OR=2.86, 95% CI=[1.65, 4.99]).<h4>Conclusion</h4>A 25% reduction on the YGTSS-TTS is highly predictive of positive response by all three analytic methods. For trained raters, however, tic severity alone does not drive the classification of positive response. Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: NCT00218777; NCT00231985.",

There were 16 recreational athletes and seven elite athletes. Most injuries (N = 15) occurred during running. The diagnosis was confirmed within 3 to 104 weeks (mean, 14 weeks) after the initial onset of symptoms. Sixteen of the patients were treated with internal fixation, the remaining seven were treated conservatively. Seven patients (30%) developed complications requiring major surgery. Five of these patients had Type 3 fractures (displaced) and four had been treated with internal fixation initially. The remaining two patients had Type 1 fractures (endosteal or periosteal callus without an overt fracture line); one was treated operatively and the other conservatively. Three patients developed avascular necrosis and two were treated by hip replacement. The third patient was treated with arthrodesis. Three refractures and one pseudarthrosis were treated by osteotomy. At followup, all elite athletes stated that they had to end their career as a result of the injury. Results were rated by the ability of the athlete to return to sports. There were 9 bad or fair results, 13 good, and 1 excellent result. No difference in activity level or subjective rating was observed between the surgically and conservatively treated group either preinjury or postinjury. The most important factor influencing the complication rate seems to be the type of fracture. The high incidence of displaced fractures (Type 3) could speculatively be caused by undiagnosed tension side stress fractures. If so, the delay in correct diagnosis may be disastrous. However, we could only objectively observe this in one of our cases.",

Clinical observations suggest a worse prognosis for secondary than for primary MDS, but differences in survival have not been studied in a general population sample.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to describe survival in MDS patients according to previous cancer diagnosis. Our study included 3,938 MDS cases diagnosed in 2001-2004 and reported by registries which have participated in SEER since the 1970s.<h4>Results</h4>A previous cancer diagnosis (26% of MDS cases) was associated with 13% increased risk of death from any cause among MDS cases (hazard ratio [HR]=1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.25). Radiation treatment for a previous cancer was associated with 52% increased risk of death (95% CI: 1.15-2.02). Shortened survival was most pronounced if the latency between the previous cancer and MDS was less than five years, including lung cancer diagnosed in the year preceding MDS (HR = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.93-6.10) and lymphohematopoietic cancer 1-5 years before MDS (HR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.33-3.36).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results confirm a more severe prognosis for secondary MDS than for primary MDS, associated with certain types and treatments of previous cancer.",

The purpose of this review is to address the role of early source control in the management of patients with severe sepsis.<h4>Results</h4>Establishing a clinical diagnosis as soon as possible is a prerequisite in patients with severe sepsis; in some cases, a surgical procedure can also serve as a diagnostic tool. Although source control is considered an essential element in the management of these patients, the definition and usefulness of early source control is not clear. Often, it is suggested that in non-severely ill patients, source control can be postponed up to 24 h, but this is related more to the lack of studies that demonstrate an advantage of early source control than to a sound pathophysiological rationale. Obstacles to early source control are numerous, but in most patients, there is little reason to delay source control for more than a few hours to allow preoperative optimization and correction of metabolic derangements. Finally, a three-level classification of urgency for source control measures is proposed. For every patient, the most appropriate method suited at that particular moment has to be chosen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Source control is considered an essential element in the management of sepsis and should be considered and performed early after the diagnosis is established in most if not all patients.",

Antibiotic dosing was as per the treating clinician either by intermittent bolus or continuous infusion. Target trough concentration was defined as ≥15 mg/L and target pharmacodynamic index was defined as an area under the concentration-time curve over a 24-hour period divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected bacteria (AUC0-24/MIC ratio) >400 (assuming MIC ≤1 mg/L).<h4>Results</h4>Data of 42 patients from 26 ICUs were eligible for analysis. A total of 24 patients received vancomycin by continuous infusion (57%). Daily dosage of vancomycin was 27 mg/kg (interquartile range (IQR) 18 to 32), and not different between patients receiving intermittent or continuous infusion. Trough concentrations were highly variable (median 27, IQR 8 to 23 mg/L). Target trough concentrations were achieved in 57% of patients, but more frequently in patients receiving continuous infusion (71% versus 39%; P = 0.038). Also the target AUC0-24/MIC ratio was reached more frequently in patients receiving continuous infusion (88% versus 50%; P = 0.008). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment by the propensity score could not confirm continuous infusion as an independent predictor of an AUC0-24/MIC >400 (odds ratio (OR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2 to 12.0) or a Cmin ≥15 mg/L (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 8.5).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrated large interindividual variability in vancomycin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target attainment in ICU patients. These data suggests that a re-evaluation of current vancomycin dosing recommendations in critically ill patients is needed to more rapidly and consistently achieve sufficient vancomycin exposure.",https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/cc13874

Relapsed or refractory disease is generally considered incurable by conventional therapeutic approaches, although durable responses can be achieved with novel monoclonal antibodies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) may have potential value by inducing graft vs-lymphoma (GvL) effects, but there is currently no consensus regarding the timing of alloHSCT or type of conditioning regimen. Here we present the case of a male patient who achieved a complete remission (CR) of primary refractory SS after non-myeloablative alloHSCT. Patient: Two years prior to HSCT, the patient had been refractory to CHOEP-based chemotherapy, interferon, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), and bexarotene. Directly prior to alloHSCT brentuximab-vedotin (BV) was applied resulting in a partial remission of the skin compartment and overall in a stable disease. Prior to HSCT, flow cytometry of the bone marrow and peripheral blood showed an infiltration with T-cells positive for CD5, CD4, low CD3, low CD2 and negative for CD7, CD38, HLA-DR and CD8. The trephine biopsy showed a 7% infiltration of SS cells. The CD4:CD8 ratio in peripheral blood (pb) was massively increased at 76.67, with 63.5% of white blood cells expressing a SS immune phenotype. The conditioning regimen included 30 mg/m2 fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from day-1 and mycophenolate mofetil from day 0. The patient received 6.55x106 CD34+ cells and 1.11x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight. Bone marrow evaluation on day 28 still showed persistent SS cells by flow cytometry. After tapering immunosuppression until day 169, the CD4:CD8 ratio in pb normalized. CR was documented on day 169 after alloHSCT and is now ongoing for almost 3 years after alloHSCT. Conclusions: We confirm that an alloHSCT can be a curative option for refractory patients with SS. The achievement of a CR after tapering the immunosuppressive therapy indicates a significant role of the GvL effect. In present treatment algorithms for patients with SS, the timing of an alloHSCT and the intensity of conditioning should be further explored.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.749691/pdf

Common ICI toxicities have become familiar to clinicians; however, rare delayed toxicities remain challenging given the paucity of data with such presentations. We present the unique case of a 61-year-old with metastatic melanoma with two rare, delayed ICI-induced toxicities. After resection of a large symptomatic parietal metastases, this patient received two doses of combination ipilimumab and nivolumab. Five weeks following his second dose, he developed ICI-induced pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion and early signs of tamponade. Corticosteroids were not administered due to a concurrent cerebral abscess. Administration of colchicine, ibuprofen, judicious monitoring, and cessation of immunotherapy led to the complete resolution of the effusion over several weeks. Seven months following his last dose of immunotherapy, the patient developed ICI-associated grade four autoimmune encephalitis, presenting as status epilepticus. High-dose steroid initiation led to rapid clinical improvement. The patient remains in near-complete response on imaging with no recurrence of pericardial effusion and partial resolution of neurological symptoms. ICI-induced pericardial disease and encephalitis carry substantial mortality rates and prompt diagnosis and management is critical.

However, they fail to completely eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSCs) due to their higher DNA repair capacity of cancer stem cells than that of bulk cancer cells, which becomes the root of drug resistance and leukemia recurrence. A new strategy to eliminate LSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is therefore urgently needed.<h4>Results</h4>We report that a low-dose chidamide, a novel orally active benzamide-type histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which selectively targets HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 10, could enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents (daunorubicin, idarubicin, and cytarabine) in CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup> KG1α cells, CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup> Kasumi cells, and primary refractory or relapsed AML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, reflected by the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and increase of cell cycle arrest in vitro. Mechanistically, these events were associated with DNA damage accumulation and repair defects. Co-treatment with chidamide and the DNA-damaging agent IDA gave rise to the production of γH2A.X and inhibited posttranslationally but not transcriptionally the repair gene of ATM, BRCA1, and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and 2 (CHK2) phosphorylation. Finally, the combination of chidamide and IDA initiated caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, but not caspase-8 and caspase-9, and ultimately induced CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup> KG1α cell apoptosis. Further analysis of AML patients' clinical characteristics revealed that the ex vivo efficacy of chidamide in combination with IDA in primary CD34<sup>+</sup> samples was significantly correlated to peripheral blood WBC counts at diagnosis, while LDH levels and karyotype status had no effect, indicating that the combination regimen of chidamide and IDA could rapidly diminish tumor burden in patients with R/R AML.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings provide preclinical evidence for low-dose chidamide in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in treating recurrent/resistant AML as an alternative salvage regimen, especially those possessing stem and progenitor cells.",https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13148-017-0377-8

The visualization rate of the transverse view of the upper fetal chest at the level of drainage of the LBCV into the superior vena cava (SVC) by two-dimensional (2D) and 2D plus color Doppler ultrasound was evaluated. Reference ranges of LBCV diameter during non-complicated pregnancies were established. Interobserver and intraobserver measurement variability was analyzed. In addition, a retrospective review of the hospital medical records of 91 pregnancies with fetuses diagnosed with LBCV abnormalities was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Sonographic assessment of the fetal LBCV was consistently achieved in the second and third trimesters and in some fetuses in the first trimester of pregnancy. In normal fetuses LBCV diameter increased significantly throughout pregnancy, with a mean value of 0.7 mm at 11 weeks and 4.9 mm at term. Dilation of the fetal LBCV was noted in five cases of intracranial arteriovenous malformation and six cases of supracardiac type total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Abnormal course of the LBCV was noted in 12 fetuses. In 63 fetuses with a persistent left SVC and a right SVC the LBCV was absent.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This is the first study describing an effective sonographic approach for the assessment of fetal LBCV dimensions during pregnancy. The normative data may provide an additional means of detecting rare anomalies of systemic and pulmonary veins during pregnancy.",

Coronaviruses are known to infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species causing remarkably diverse disease syndromes. Variable tissue tropism and the ability to easily cross interspecies barriers are the well-known characteristics of certain CoVs. The 21st century epidemics of severe acute respiratory CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory CoV and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic further highlight these characteristics and emphasize the relevance of CoVs to the global public health. Bovine CoVs (BCoVs) are betacoronaviruses associated with neonatal calf diarrhea, and with winter dysentery and shipping fever in older cattle. Of interest, no distinct genetic or antigenic markers have been identified in BCoVs associated with these distinct clinical syndromes. In contrast, like other CoVs, BCoVs exist as quasispecies. Besides cattle, BCoVs and bovine-like CoVs were identified in various domestic and wild ruminant species (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama, alpaca, deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes, and wild goats), dogs and humans. Surprisingly, bovine-like CoVs also cannot be reliably distinguished from BCoVs using comparative genomics. Additionally, there are historical examples of zoonotic transmission of BCoVs.

An impact on morbidity should be anticipated to be earlier and more easily detected than the impact on mortality.<h4>Methods</h4>Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock for <72 h who underwent a short high-dose ACTH test in 52 centers in 9 European countries. Patients received 11-day treatment with hydrocortisone or placebo. Organ dysfunction/failure was quantified by the use of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score.<h4>Results</h4>From March 2002 to November 2005, 499 patients were enrolled (hydrocortisone 251, placebo 248). Both groups presented a similar SOFA score at baseline (hydrocortisone 10.8 ± 3.2 vs. placebo 10.7 ± 3.1 points). There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the two treatment groups (hydrocortisone 34.3% vs. placebo 31.5%). There was a decrease in the SOFA score of hydrocortisone-treated patients from day 0 to day 7 compared to the placebo-treated patients (p = 0.0027), driven by an improvement in cardiovascular organ dysfunction/failure (p = 0.0005) and in liver failure (p < 0.0001) in the hydrocortisone-treated patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patients randomized to treatment with hydrocortisone demonstrated a faster decrease in total organ dysfunction/failure determined by the SOFA score, primarily driven by a faster improvement in cardiovascular organ dysfunction/failure. This organ dysfunction/failure improvement was not accompanied by a decreased mortality.",

Commonest presenting features were acute headache (87%), diplopia (47·2%) and visual field (VF) defects (36%). The most frequent ocular palsy involved the 3rd nerve (81%), followed by 6th nerve (34·6%) and multiple palsies (19%). Twenty-three patients were treated conservatively, and the rest had surgery either within 7 days of presentation or delayed elective surgery. Indications for surgery were deteriorating visual acuity and persistent field defects. Patients presenting with VF defects (n = 20) were more likely to undergo surgery (75%) than to be managed expectantly (25%). There was no difference in the rates of complete/near-complete resolution of VF deficits and cranial nerve palsies between those treated conservatively and those who underwent surgery. Endocrine outcomes were also similar. We were able to calculate the PAS for 46 patients: for the group treated with early surgery mean, PAS was 3·8 and for those managed conservatively or with delayed surgery was 1·8.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients without VF deficits or whose visual deficits are stable or improving can be managed expectantly without negative impact on outcomes. Clinical severity based on a PAS ≥ 4 appeared to influence management towards emergency surgical intervention.",

MCL1 is one of the anti-apoptotic proteins. Chidamide targets the MCL1 protein, which may permit venetoclax resistance when upregulated. We determined MCL1 protein expression in different AML cell lines, and chidamide could downregulate MCL1 expression in venetoclax resistance AML cells.

The patients were classified as: (1) high frequency patients, reporting from weekly to daily episodes and (2) low frequency patients, with ≤3 episodes per month. According to their body mass index percentiles, the patients were divided in ""Normal weight"" (from ≥5 to <85 percentile), ""Overweight"" (from ≥85 to <95 percentile), and ""Obese"" (≥95 percentile). Given the low number of obese patients, the overweight and obese groups were considered together in the ""Overweight"" group.

A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission.<h4>Participants</h4>20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital.<h4>Results</h4>The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16%, 2830/17 506); 23% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date.

We now show that WT1 functions also as a transcriptional activator. Using chimeric reporter plasmids, we demonstrated that WT1 requires both 5' and 3' binding sites relative to transcription start site for transcriptional repression; however, when WT1 binds to either the 5' or the 3' site alone, WT1 functions to activate transcription. We truncated the wt1 gene and established that amino acid residues 84-179 are required for transcriptional suppression, whereas amino acid residues 180-294 contain a domain that mediates transcriptional activation. These results establish that WT1 has regulatory domains that function either to activate or suppress transcription and suggest the possibility that WT1 functions as an activator and not as a suppressor of selected gene transcription.",

However, clinicians often do not adhere to these recommendations, mainly due to nephrotoxicity risk, unfamiliarity with the guideline, or complexity of calculating an individual dose. Therefore, we introduced a computerised clinical decision support system (CDSS) for vancomycin loading (hereafter Vancomycin CDSS) to promote the use of vancomycin loading dose.<h4>Methods</h4>We describe a quasi-experimental study spanning 6 months before and 18 months after the deployment of a Vancomycin CDSS. The Vancomycin CDSS was integrated into the hospital's electronic medical record system in the form of a vancomycin order set. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of nephrotoxicity; the secondary endpoint was mean initial vancomycin trough levels. We also conducted a survey to evaluate the reasons why clinicians opted not to utilise a vancomycin loading dose.<h4>Results</h4>After implementation of Vancomycin CDSS, 363 out of 746 patients (49 %) who were first administered vancomycin received a loading dose. We did not find significant differences in nephrotoxicity between the pre- and post-intervention groups, nor between the loading- and non-loading groups. In the pre-intervention group, the mean initial vancomycin trough level was 7.10 mg/L, which was significantly lower than that in the post-intervention group of 11.11 mg/L. In the vancomycin loading group, the mean initial trough level was 11.95 mg/L, compared to 7.55 mg/L in the non-loading group. The main reason stated for not prescribing a vancomycin loading dose was concern about nephrotoxicity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Introduction of the Vancomycin CDSS did not increase nephrotoxicity and increased the mean initial dose and trough level of vancomycin.",

Although the right hemisphere is predominantly linked to the processing of affective prosodic cues, existing literature also suggests that damage to the left hemisphere can result in similar deficits. This study aims to demonstrate, and add to the evidence, that patients with left-hemisphere injury experience difficulties with affective prosodic perception and production, measured via a new combination of assessments and analyses. It is also hypothesised that aphasia severity will be correlated with impaired processing of affective prosody.<h4>Results</h4>Stroke and control participants differed significantly on prosody perception tests of matching auditory affective cues to visual images. Prosodic production was measured by participants vocalising different affective expressions of words and monosyllables - from which significant differences were found in perceptual judgements of emotion accuracy and intensity, and acoustic analyses of pitch range and variance. There were significant correlations between participants' Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) scores, quality of life, and prosody production.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Individuals with left-hemisphere damage after stroke have impaired affective prosodic perception and production that may be associated with reduced quality of life.",

Pharmacokinetic parameters were gathered from previously published studies. The AUC<sub>24</sub>/MIC ratio of at least 400 and an average of AUC<sub>0-24</sub> at > 700mgh/L were utilized to evaluate efficacy and nephrotoxicity, respectively. The doses achieved at least 90% of the probability of target attainment (PTA) with the lowest risk of nephrotoxicity defined as the optimal dose.<h4>Results</h4>The regimens of 1.75grams every 24hours and 1.5grams loading followed by 500mg every 8hours were recommended for empirical therapy of an MRSA infection with expected MIC ≤1mg/L, and definite therapy with actual MIC of 1mg/L. The probabilities of nephrotoxic results from these regimens were 35%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A higher dose of vancomycin than the current literature-based recommendation was needed in CRRT patients.",

Patients with bithalamic infarction represented 0.6% of our registry which included 2,750 ischaemic stroke patients. On computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement, there were 4 topographic patterns of infarction: 1) bilateral infarcts in the territory of paramedian artery (8 patients [50%]); 2) bilateral infarcts in the territory of thalamogeniculate arteries (3 patients [19%]); 3) bilateral infarcts involving territory of paramedian and thalamogeniculate arteries (3 patients [19%]); 4) bilateral infarcts involving territory of polar and thalamogeniculate arteries (2 patients [13%]). A specific clinical picture was found in up to 50% of the patients with bithalamic infarction. This included patients with bilateral paramedian infarction having disorder of consciousness, memory dysfunctions, various types of vertical gaze palsy and psychic changes. Bilateral sensory loss predicted accurately bilateral infarction in the territory of thalamogeniculate arteries. The main cause of bilateral thalamic infarction was small artery-disease, followed by cardioembolism. Cognitive functions in patients with bilateral paramedian infarction did not change significantly during the follow-up, in contrast to those with infarcts in varied arterial territories. Acute bilateral infarction involving both thalamus is uncommon, although they are often associated with specific neurologic-neuropsychological patterns, allowing diagnosis before radiological examination.",

Its classification as a subtype of melanoma versus a borderline melanocytic tumor is debated.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our primary objective was to characterize the demographics, clinical presentation, histopathology, management, and outcomes of patients with animal-type melanoma.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the English-language literature on animal-type melanoma.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 190 cases of animal-type melanoma. They occurred equally in men and women, with Caucasians (53.7%) most commonly affected. The median Breslow depth was 3.8 mm; ulceration was reported present in 15.8%; and dermal mitoses greater than or equal to 1/mm(2) was reported in 27.4%. The most common initial management was wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy (55.7%). In all, 78 patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy with 41.0% positivity rate. A total of 32 patients underwent completion lymph node dissection with 34.4% positivity rate. Locoregional recurrence was reported in 15 patients, recurrence with distant metastases in 6 patients, and death in 5 patients.<h4>Limitations</h4>Data were obtained from small studies with limited follow-up.

Incidence in this period was compared with that of 3 previous periods (July 1976 through June 1983 [first period], July 1983 through June 1990 [second period], and July 1990 through December 1995 [third period]).<h4>Results</h4>In the 1996-2001 period, 542 cases of VS were diagnosed, representing a mean incidence of 17.4 VS/1 million inhabitants per year. Of these, 227 tumors underwent operation, 14 underwent irradiation, and 301 were allocated to observation (wait-and-scan policy). One hundred sixty-six tumors were intrameatal. Size of extrameatal tumors was small in 104; medium in 194; large in 68; and giant (>40 mm) in 10. Compared with incidences of 7.8 VS/1 million inhabitants per year in the first, 9.4 VS/1 million inhabitants in the second, and 12.4 VS/1 million inhabitants in the third periods, the incidence for the 1996-2001 period represents an increase to 17.4 VS/1 million inhabitants per year. The mean incidence for the entire 25.5-year period was 11.5 VS/1 million inhabitants per year.<h4>Conclusions</h4>An estimate of a realistic mean incidence of VS depends on the observation period. Our 25.5-year registration of an entire population showed a mean incidence of 11.5 VS/1 million inhabitants per year. However, the latest period registered represents an incidence of 17.4 VS/1 million inhabitants per year, which, combined with a probable further increase of diagnosed tumors in forthcoming years, suggests a realistic incidence of approximately 13 VS/1 million inhabitants per year.",

Although some studies have proved the severity of FMPP, the details about clinical diagnosis and treatment of FMPP in children have been rarely reported. In this case study, we described three cases who suffered from FMPP. These children not only developed acute lung injury and multiple organ involvement within 7 days of treatment, but were also found plastic bronchitis by bronchoscopy. Finally, all the patients were treated successfully with azithromycin, glucocorticoid, and bronchoscopy lavage. We conclude that this case study would contribute to raise awareness with respect to FMPP, which may occur at a younger age with faster disease progression and common extrapulmonary manifestations.

The ultrasound appearance of the tumors was described on the basis of ultrasound images, ultrasound reports and research protocols (when applicable) by one author from each center using the terms and definitions of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group. In addition, two authors reviewed together available digital ultrasound images and used pattern recognition to describe the typical ultrasound appearance of decidualized endometriomas.<h4>Results</h4>Eighteen eligible women were identified. Median age was 34 (range, 20-43) years. Median gestational age at surgical removal of the decidualized endometrioma was 18 (range, 11-41) weeks. Seventeen women (94%) were asymptomatic and one presented with pelvic pain. In three of the 18 women an ultrasound diagnosis of endometrioma had been made before pregnancy. The original ultrasound examiner was uncertain whether the mass was benign or malignant in 10 (56%) women and suggested a diagnosis of benignity in nine (50%) women, borderline in eight women (44%), and invasive malignancy in one (6%) woman. Seventeen decidualized endometriomas contained a papillary projection, and in 16 of these at least one of the papillary projections was vascularized at power or color Doppler examination. The number of cyst locules varied between one (n = 11) and four. No woman had ascites. When using pattern recognition, most decidualized endometriomas (14/17, 82%) were described as manifesting vascularized rounded papillary projections with a smooth contour in an ovarian cyst with one or a few cyst locules and ground-glass or low-level echogenicity of the cyst fluid.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Rounded vascularized papillary projections with smooth contours within an ovarian cyst with cyst contents of ground-glass or low-level echogenicity are typical of surgically removed decidualized endometriomas in pregnant women, most of whom are asymptomatic.",

The causative focus mostly originated from pharyngitis or tonsillitis, accounting for over 85% of the cases of Lemierre's syndrome. Pneumonia or pleural empyema is the most common metastatic infection in Lemierre's syndrome. Antimicrobial therapy should be prescribed for 3-6 weeks. The treatment regimens include metronidazole and β-lactam antibiotics. In recent years, the antibiotic stewardship program has resulted in decreased antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory tract infections. The incidence of Lemierre's syndrome has increased over the past decade. F. necrophorum is an underestimated cause of acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

A total of 231 patients were recorded regarding their clinical, radiological and biological characteristics at presentation. The accrual period was January 1991 to December 1998. Prognosis was analysed using both univariate and multivariate (Cox model) statistics. The median survival of the whole population was 28 weeks. Univariate analysis (log-rank), showed that patients affected by one of the following characteristics proved to have a shorter survival in comparison with the opposite status of each variable: male gender, age over 63 years, poor performance status, neurological symptoms, serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level higher than 12.5 ng ml(-1), high serum alkaline phosphatase level, high serum LDH level and serum sodium level below 132 mmol l(-1). In the Cox's model, the following variables were independent determinants of a poor outcome: male gender: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.29 (1.26-4.16), poor performance status: 1.73 (1.15-2.62), age: 1.02 (1.003-1.043), a high serum NSE level: 1.72 (1.11-2.68), neurological symptoms: 1.63 (1.05-2.54), and a low serum sodium level: 2.99 (1.17-7.62). Apart from 4 prognostic factors shared in common with other stage IV NSCLC patients, whatever the metastatic site (namely sex, age, gender, performance status and serum sodium level) this study discloses 2 determinants specifically resulting from brain metastasis: i.e. the presence of neurological symptoms and a high serum NSE level. The latter factor could be in relationship with the extent of normal brain tissue damage caused by the tumour as has been demonstrated after strokes.

It is hard to believe that omental placentation alone would be sufficient to sustain a pregnancy beyond a gestation where the fetus is viable. However, this report challenges such myths and opens the debate as to what represents the minimal placental maternal viscus contact necessary to achieve fetal viability. The case also demonstrates the continuing difficulty in diagnosing this rare but serious condition despite advances in obstetric imaging, and advocates methods to avoid missing the diagnosis, which could be easily incorporated at booking and mid-trimester scans. Apart from this case, few reports describe normal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry in advanced abdominal pregnancy. There is a paucity of research on suitable clinical investigations prognostic for abdominal pregnancy, although this case provides further evidence for the use of Doppler as a useful surveillance tool in such cases. Finally, this case propagates the ethical and clinical controversy that exists in managing abdominal pregnancy, particularly when diagnosed late after attaining fetal viability.

An 8-h period of HVHF was associated with a greater reduction in norepinephrine requirements than a similar period of CVVH (median reduction: 10.5 vs. 1.0 microg/min; p = 0.01; median percentage reduction: 68 vs. 7%; p = 0.02). Both therapies were associated with a temporary reduction (p < 0.01) in the plasma concentration of C3a, C5a, and interleukin 10 within 2 h of initiation. HVHF was associated with a greater reduction in the area under the curve for C3a and C5a (p < 0.01).

Antibiotics and/or antibiotic classes reviewed included aminoglycosides, beta-lactams (including carbapenems), glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones, tigecycline, linezolid, lincosamides, and colistin.<h4>Data synthesis</h4>Antibiotics can be broadly categorized according to their solubility characteristics which can, in turn, help describe possible altered pharmacokinetics that can be caused by the pathophysiological changes common to critical illness. Hydrophilic antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and colistin) are mostly affected with the pathphysiological changes observed in critically ill patients with increased volumes of distribution and altered drug clearance (related to changes in creatinine clearance). Lipophilic antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tigecycline, and lincosamides) have lesser volume of distribution alterations, but may develop altered drug clearances. Using antibiotic pharmacodynamic bacterial kill characteristics, altered dosing regimens can be devised that also account for such pharmacokinetic changes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Knowledge of antibiotic pharmacodynamic properties and the potential altered antibiotic pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients can allow the intensivist to develop individualized dosing regimens. Specifically, for renally cleared drugs, measured creatinine clearance can be used to drive many dose adjustments. Maximizing clinical outcomes and minimizing antibiotic resistance using individualized doses may be best achieved with therapeutic drug monitoring.",

We describe a new targeting procedure in which temporary depth electrodes are placed at multiple possible targets in basal ganglia and thalamus, and probing for efficacy is performed using test stimulation and recording while children remain for one week in an inpatient Neuromodulation Monitoring Unit (NMU). Nine Children with severe secondary dystonia underwent the NMU targeting procedure. In all cases, 4 electrodes were implanted.

While Karyomapping is not designed to screen for abnormalities in chromosome copy number, this testing is based upon a genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and, as such, some chromosome abnormalities are detected. The aim of this study was to validate whether Karyomapping could provide reliable and accurate PGT for a paternal 46,XY,t(10;19)(p15;p13.3) reciprocal translocation.<h4>Methods</h4>Feasibility/validation for PGT was performed using DNA from the couple, as well as DNA from the paternal parents and from a previous unbalanced pregnancy. Karyomapping was performed using Illumina's HumanKaryomap-12 BeadChip microarray technology. SNP analysis was performed using BlueFuse Multi software (Illumina). Transmission of the translocation was assessed through the analysis of SNP markers on the chromosome regions of interest.<h4>Results</h4>PGT-SR was determined to be feasible as chromosomal SNP analysis could reliably distinguish normal/balanced outcomes from all unbalanced outcomes. The couple transferred a normal/balanced embryo in an elective single embryo transfer procedure following 2 IVF/PGT-SR cycles. A clinical pregnancy was achieved.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This is the first report of PGT-SR test validation using Karyomapping for a 46,XY,t(10;19)(p15;p13.3) reciprocal translocation. Karyomapping may offer a means of detecting unbalanced forms of chromosome rearrangements when other PGT platforms fail.",

Neurology,"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common heritable cause of stroke and vascular dementia in adults. Clinical and neuroimaging features resemble those of sporadic small-artery disease, although patients with CADASIL have an earlier age at onset of stroke events, an increased frequency of migraine with aura, and a slightly variable pattern of ischaemic white-matter lesions on brain MRI. NOTCH3 (Notch homolog 3), the gene involved in CADASIL, encodes a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed in systemic arterial smooth-muscle cells. Pathogenetic mutations alter the number of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of NOTCH3, which accumulates in small arteries of affected individuals. Functional and imaging studies in cultured cells, genetically engineered mice, and patients with CADASIL have all provided insights into the molecular and vascular mechanisms underlying this disease. A recent multicentre trial in patients with cognitive impairment emphasises the feasibility of randomised trials in patients with CADASIL. In this Review, we summarise the current understanding of CADASIL, a devastating disorder that also serves as a model for the more common forms of subcortical ischaemic strokes and pure vascular dementia.",

We conducted a prospective survey of the occurrence of PTLD in a French nationwide population of adult kidney recipients over 10 years.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>A French registry was established to cover a nationwide population of transplant recipients and prospectively enroll all adult kidney recipients who developed PTLD between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2007. Five hundred patient cases of PTLD were referred to the French registry. The prognostic factors for PTLD were investigated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses.<h4>Results</h4>Patients with PTLD had a 5-year survival rate of 53% and 10-year survival rate of 45%. Multivariable analyses revealed that age > 55 years, serum creatinine level > 133 μmol/L, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, disseminated lymphoma, brain localization, invasion of serous membranes, monomorphic PTLD, and T-cell PTLD were independent prognostic indicators of poor survival. Considering five variables at diagnosis (age, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, PTLD localization, and histology), we constructed a prognostic score that classified patients with PTLD as being at low, moderate, high, or very high risk for death. The 10-year survival rate was 85% for low-, 80% for moderate-, 56% for high-, and 0% for very high-risk recipients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This nationwide study highlights the prognostic factors for PTLD and enables the development of a new prognostic score. After validation in an independent cohort, the use of this score should allow treatment strategies to be better tailored to individual patients in the future.",

All came from a lower middle-income group and all of them were subjected to surgery. The first patient was a 30-year-old woman, who was pregnant for the fourth time, who presented at 16 weeks with an abdominal pregnancy. She was admitted with constant abdominal pain and retention of urine. She was hemodynamically stable and was administered a pre-operative intramuscular injection of methotrexate. During laparotomy she had only minor blood loss, the major part of the placenta was removed easily and she did not require any blood transfusion. Serum beta human chorionic gonadotrophin values and ultrasound follow-up revealed a normal study four weeks after surgery. The second patient was a 26-year-old woman, pregnant for the third time, admitted at 14 weeks with an abdominal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum, and the third patient was a 24-year-old woman, pregnant for the first time, who presented at 36 weeks gestation. She was only diagnosed as having an abdominal pregnancy during surgery, experienced excessive blood loss and required a longer hospital stay.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We hypothesize that treatment with pre-operative systemic methotrexate with subsequent laparotomy for removal of the fetus and placenta may minimize potential blood loss, and would be a reasonable approach in the care of a patient with an abdominal pregnancy with placental implantation to the abdominal viscera and blood vessels. This treatment option should be considered in the management of this potentially life-threatening condition. During surgery, if the placenta is attached to vital organs it should be left behind. Early diagnosis can help in reducing associated maternal morbidity and mortality.",https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.4076/1752-1947-3-7382

We conducted a nationwide study in Denmark to describe MCC incidence and mortality and the association between MCC and other cancers.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data from Danish national health and population registers on MCC diagnoses, deaths, and population counts during the study period (1978-2006) to calculate MCC incidence rates, cumulative risks of MCC at age 100 years, and MCC mortality rates by tumor stage. We used Poisson regression to estimate the excess mortality rate ratio attributable to MCC and examined associations between MCC and other cancers diagnosed before and after the MCC diagnosis using standardized incidence rate ratios (SIRs). All statistical tests were two-sided.<h4>Results</h4>Between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 2006, 185 persons were diagnosed with MCC in Denmark. MCC incidence between 1995 and 2006 was 2.2 cases per million person-years. In the first year after MCC diagnosis, 22% of persons with localized disease died compared with 54% of patients with nonlocalized disease; by 5 years after diagnosis, the proportions of MCC patients who had died increased to 55% and 84%, respectively. MCC incidence was statistically significantly increased more than 1 year after a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SIR = 14.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.4 to 25.6), basal cell carcinoma (SIR = 4.3, 95% CI = 2.7 to 6.6), malignant melanoma (SIR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.1 to 10.3), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 12.0, 95% CI = 3.8 to 37.8), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 17.6, 95% CI = 2.5 to 126), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.4 to 22.4). Squamous cell carcinoma (SIR = 12.1, 95% CI = 5.1 to 29.1) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 14.7, 95% CI = 3.7 to 58.8) occurred in statistically significant excess more than 1 year after MCC diagnosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results support the existence of shared risk factors for MCC and other cancers. Heightened awareness of the association between MCC and other cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, may facilitate earlier clinical detection and treatment of MCC, thereby improving patient survival.",

Although epidemiologic and genetical studies have underlined the multifactorial aetiology and gender-related differences of bladder cancer, there is lack of evidence-based recommendation for gender-specific management of bladder cancer. We summarize the evidence and most recent findings on gender-specific differences in bladder cancer incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome, spotlighting the gender disparities in genetic and hormonal risk factors, pelvic anatomy, diagnostic setting and surgical choices. We reviewed the literature published on PubMed between 1981 and 2018. Males have a threefold to fourfold higher risk of bladder cancer as compared to females; however, women have higher stage-for-stage mortality, being diagnosed with more advanced disease, mostly due to a delay in haematuria evaluation. Numerous studies indicate an increased risk of disease recurrence or progression in women with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with trans-urethral resection, with or without intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy, compared to males. In particular, recent molecular evidence show that there is an excess of female Ta mutant tumours. At the time of radical cystectomy, women have a significantly longer length of hospital stay, operative time, higher blood loss and higher 90-day mortality and perioperative complication rate. Moreover, females are less likely to receive a continent diversion. Future research should guarantee greater inclusion of women in trials and focus on improving the effectiveness of therapies in women, perhaps exploring different therapeutic approaches in men and women. Specific data on functional and oncological outcomes can be analysed to define predictive factors able to guide the surgeon in decisions based on evidence. It is urgently needed to limit gender-related discrepancies in early diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. Public awareness and bladder cancer female patients' consciousness on gender inequalities must be similarly uprisen.",

Cats act as the natural reservoir of B. henselae and can transmit the infection to humans by a bite or scratch. The prevalence of B. henselae in cat populations was evaluated by serological and bacteriological tests. A total of 769 stray cats from three urban and three rural areas in northern Italy were sampled between January 1999 and December 2000. The positive and the negative predictive values of serological tests with respect to bacteremic status were evaluated. Tests of a total of 140 cats (18%) resulted in detection of bacteremia. A total of 540 cats were tested by serology; 207 (38%) were seropositive. Of the 531 cats tested by both methods, the results for 65 (12.2%) showed both bacteremia detection and seropositivity. The molecular typing of the isolates showed that 20.6% of bacteremic cats were infected with B. henselae type I strain, 61.1% were infected with B. henselae type II, and 18.3% were coinfected with both. A statistically significant difference in antibody and bacteremia prevalences among geographical areas was detected. Statistical analysis showed no association between characteristics such as seroprevalence-bacteremic status, sex, general health status, and the presence of ectoparasites. The negative predictive value of serological test was 84.7%, and the positive predictive value was 31.8%. Receiving operator characteristic analysis of the data showed that serological tests had a low predictive value in relation to the bacteremic status of a cat; in surveys aimed at assessing the real risk of B. henselae infection in a human population, therefore, we suggest the use of blood culture as the reference test. Nevertheless, both blood culture assays and serological tests for Bartonella infection should be performed for a complete evaluation of the health status of cats.",

The patients were divided into positive fluid balance group (n = 52) and negative fluid balance group (n = 65) according to the total amount of fluid calculated from the difference between fluid administered and fluid lost during the first 1 week of RRT. The incidence of renal recovery and death of the patients by 60 days as the endpoint events were taken to judge the prognosis of two groups. RRT strategies included continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT). Multiple factors including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, RRT model, the accumulation of fluid before initiation of RRT, and negative fluid balance during RRT were analyzed for outcome predictors by Cox proportional hazards model.<h4>Results</h4>There were no differences between two groups regarding clinical characteristics. The percentage of receiving CRRT in the negative fluid balance group was slightly higher than that of the positive fluid balance group (52.31% vs. 36.54%, χ² = 2.899, P = 0.089). With Kaplan-Meier survival curves, it was shown that the patients of negative fluid balance group had a higher rate of recovery of renal function (χ² = 4.803, P = 0.028) and significantly lower mortality rate (χ² = 9.505, P = 0.002). The rate of recovery of renal function by 60 days was higher in the negative fluid balance group than that in the positive fluid balance group (47.69% vs. 28.85%, χ² = 3.991, P = 0.046), while the mortality rate was significantly lowered in the negative fluid balance group compared with that of the positive fluid balance group (40.00% vs. 67.31%, χ² = 4.378, P = 0.036). Cox multivariate regression was used for excluding confounding factors. After adjusting for the clinically relevant variables, RRT negative fluid balance was significantly associated with recovery of renal function [ hazard ratios (HR) = 2.440, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) = 1.089-5.464, P = 0.030] and mortality (HR = 0.443, 95%CI = 0.238-0.822, P = 0.010]. Higher eGFR before RRT and CRRT were independent favorable factors for recovery of renal function (HR = 1.014, 95%CI = 1.003-1.026, P = 0.012; HR = 3.138, 95%CI = 1.765-7.461, P = 0.002), and higher SOFA score was associated with a significantly higher risk of death (HR = 1.115, 95%CI = 1.057-1.177, P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Once the patients with septic AKI showed the signs of fluid overload, timely RRT and effective removal of excessive liquid may reverse the adverse prognosis. RRT with negative fluid balance is beneficial for the recovery of renal function, and reduce the mortality in patients with septic AKI, and CRRT model is a good choice.",

Despite the high mean thickness of the lesions, reports seem to indicate a less aggressive behavior and a better survival rate for ATM compared with conventional melanoma, but the underlying pathways related to this favorable outcome are still unknown.<h4>Observations</h4>Five women and 2 men aged 20 to 92 years presented with pigmented skin nodules (n = 5) or plaques (n = 2), varying in size from 1.0 to 4.5 cm. Findings from microscopic examination showed monotypic-appearing melanocytes with abundant intracytoplasmic melanin in a nodular or fascicular arrangement (mean Breslow thickness, 4.97 mm). Immunohistochemical analysis of ATM cells demonstrated the typical positive staining for S-100, vimentin, HMB-45, and melan-A. The investigation of the pi isoform of glutathione S-transferase, a family of enzymes involved in tumor progression, revealed that nuclear expression is reduced in ATMs compared with control melanomas, whereas results from cytoplasmic staining did not vary. One patient died of cardiac failure without evidence of disease progression; the remaining patients are disease-free at 3 (n = 4) and 5 years (n = 3).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings confirm that ATM is a variant of melanoma with distinctive clinical and histological features. Low nuclear expression of glutathione S-transferase pi expression is a characteristic of ATM and could add new insight to better understand the unusual biological behavior of this rare neoplasm.",

However, referring to ED a whole range of conditions that could or should be dealt with elsewhere is imposing itself as a problematic situation. We aimed: (1) to provide a descriptive picture of the socio-demographic and diagnostic characteristics of the visits among adults at the psychiatric ED; (2) to estimate the clinical pertinence of these visits.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Retrospective analysis of diagnostic/socio-demographic characteristics and clinical trajectories of patients admitted for a psychiatric condition at the adult psychiatric ED of the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG), Switzerland, during a 6-week timespan.<h4>Results</h4>In our sample (<i>n</i> = 763 total admissions for psychiatric conditions; <i>n</i> = 702 for inclusion of patients having received a medical evaluation), depression/anxiety, suicidal behavior (SB), psychotic episode, and substance use disorder (SUD), in descending order, were the most common diagnoses for referral. Patients belonged to younger age groups (≤65 years), had a familial status other than married/in couple, and did not present an unfavorable socio-demographic profile. Concerning the pertinence for a psychiatric ED, primary diagnosis of depression/anxiety is the only variable significantly associated with different grade of degree. By the examination of the patients' trajectory from admission to discharge, the clinical pertinence for a psychiatric ED admission existed for cases assigned to the Echelle Suisse du Tri (EST<sup>®</sup>) scale degree 1 (corresponding to most urgent and severe conditions), particularly for diagnoses of depression/anxiety associated with SB, SB as primary or comorbid diagnosis, and psychotic and manic/hypomanic episode. However, diagnoses of depression/anxiety without urgent and severe features (degrees 2, 3, 4) constituted the most frequent mode of presentation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ambulatory and community-integrated settings could be more appropriate for the majority of patients admitted to adult psychiatric EDs. Moreover, the implementation of telepsychiatry strategies represents a very promising opportunity to offer these patients care continuity, reduce costs and filter the demand for psychiatric ED.",https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/56/6/295/pdf?version=1616053103

An additional 11 randomized clinical trials submitted from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2016 were included.<h4>Data extraction and synthesis</h4>Two investigators abstracted data and pooled data to compare trial-level milestone ratios with conventional end points.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Trial-level milestone ratios for milestone rates were calculated for overall response rate (ORR) within 6 months, 9-month progression-free survival (PFS), 9-month overall survival (OS), and 12-month OS. A weighted linear regression model evaluated associations between milestone ratios and hazard ratios (HRs). Experimental and control arms of trials testing immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and other trials were pooled to compare Kaplan-Meier survival estimates in the 3 therapeutic classes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 20 013 unique patients (65.4% male and 34.6% female; mean age, 60 [range, 18-92] years) with advanced lung cancer were identified in 25 unique trials. A moderate association was observed between 12-month OS milestone ratio and OS HR (R2 = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-0.91) and 9-month OS milestone ratio and OS HR (R2 = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82). No associations were observed between 9-month PFS milestone ratio and OS HR (R2 = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.49) or 6-month ORR and OS HR (R2 = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.0001-0.31). The aggregated Kaplan-Meier analysis of immunotherapy trials vs chemotherapy revealed an OS HR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.75) and PFS HR of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.89). Targeted therapy trials vs chemotherapy had an OS HR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80-1.19) and PFS HR of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.42-0.56).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>This analysis of milestone rates suggests a moderate association between OS milestones at 12 or 9 months and OS HR but not 9-month PFS or 6-month ORR milestones and OS HR. Although OS at 12 months had the strongest association with OS HR, it may not be the optimal time for future trials, which will increasingly have immunotherapy as the control, deploy new biomarker-enrichment strategies, and likely enroll patients with longer survival. Milestone rates may be useful as a complementary tool to summarize or interpret trial results or as a secondary end point in exploratory studies.",

Its surgical treatment is challenging because of its anatomically close relations to the optic nerve, carotid artery, ophthalmic artery, anterior clinoid process, and cavernous sinus, which hinder direct access. Despite recent technical advancements enabling risk reduction of this complication, postoperative deterioration of visual function remains a significant problem. Therefore, the goal of preserving and/or improving the visual outcome persists as a paramount concern. <b>Objective:</b> We propose optic foraminotomy as an alternative microsurgical technique for dorsal carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms clipping. As a secondary objective, the step by step of that technique and its benefits are compared to the current approach of anterior clinoidectomy. <b>Methods:</b> We present as an example two patients with superior carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms in which the standard pterional craniotomy, transsylvian approach, and optic foraminotomy were performed. Surgical techniques are presented and discussed in detail with the use of skull base dissections, microsurgical images, and original drawings. <b>Results:</b> Extensive opening of the optic canal and optic nerve sheath was successfully achieved in all patients allowing a working angle with the carotid artery for correct visualization of the aneurysm and further clipping. Significant visual acuity improvement occurred in both patients because of decompression of the optic nerve. <b>Conclusion:</b> Optic foraminotomy is an easy and recommended technique for exposing and treating superior carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms and allowing optic nerve decompression during the first stages of the procedure. It shows several advantages over the current anterior clinoidectomy technique regarding surgical exposure and facilitating visual improvement.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2021.681115/pdf

The universal definition differentiates patients with myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture (type 1) from those due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) secondary to other acute illnesses. Patients with myocardial necrosis, but no symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia, are classified as acute or chronic myocardial injury. This classification has not been widely adopted in practice, because the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction encompass a wide range of presentations, and the implications of the diagnosis are uncertain. However, both myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction are common, occurring in more than one-third of all hospitalised patients. These patients have poor short-term and long-term outcomes with two-thirds dead in 5 years. The classification of patients with myocardial infarction continues to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to recognise the importance of identifying coronary artery disease in type 2 myocardial infarction. Clinicians should consider whether coronary artery disease has contributed to myocardial injury, as selected patients are likely to benefit from further investigation and in these patients targeted secondary prevention has the potential to improve outcomes.",https://heart.bmj.com/content/heartjnl/103/1/10.full.pdf

Clinical management of DSD is often difficult and currently only 13% of patients receive an accurate clinical genetic diagnosis. To address this we have developed a massively parallel sequencing targeted DSD gene panel which allows us to sequence all 64 known diagnostic DSD genes and candidate genes simultaneously.<h4>Results</h4>We analyzed DNA from the largest reported international cohort of patients with DSD (278 patients with 46,XY DSD and 48 with 46,XX DSD). Our targeted gene panel compares favorably with other sequencing platforms. We found a total of 28 diagnostic genes that are implicated in DSD, highlighting the genetic spectrum of this disorder. Sequencing revealed 93 previously unreported DSD gene variants. Overall, we identified a likely genetic diagnosis in 43% of patients with 46,XY DSD. In patients with 46,XY disorders of androgen synthesis and action the genetic diagnosis rate reached 60%. Surprisingly, little difference in diagnostic rate was observed between singletons and trios. In many cases our findings are informative as to the likely cause of the DSD, which will facilitate clinical management.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our massively parallel sequencing targeted DSD gene panel represents an economical means of improving the genetic diagnostic capability for patients affected by DSD. Implementation of this panel in a large cohort of patients has expanded our understanding of the underlying genetic etiology of DSD. The inclusion of research candidate genes also provides an invaluable resource for future identification of novel genes.",https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13059-016-1105-y

A genetic diagnosis is made in only around 20% of these cases. The genetic causes of 46,XX-SRY negative testicular DSD as well as ovotesticular DSD are poorly defined. Duplications involving a region located ∼600 kb upstream of SOX9, a key gene in testis development, were reported in several cases of 46,XX DSD. Recent studies have narrowed this region down to a 78 kb interval that is duplicated or deleted respectively in 46,XX or 46,XY DSD. We identified three phenotypically normal patients presenting with azoospermia and 46,XX testicular DSD. Two brothers carried a 83.8 kb duplication located ∼600 kb upstream of SOX9 that overlapped with the previously reported rearrangements.

Endocrinology,"Sex-specific gonadal development starts with formation of the bipotential gonad, which then differentiates into either a mature testis or an ovary. This process is dependent on activation of either the testis-specific or the ovary-specific pathway while the opposite pathway is continuously repressed. A network of transcription factors tightly regulates initiation and maintenance of these distinct pathways; disruption of these networks can lead to disorders of sex development in humans and male-to-female or female-to-male sex reversal in mice. Sry is the Y-linked master switch that is both required and sufficient to drive the testis-determining pathway. Another key component of the testis pathway is Sox9, which acts immediately downstream of Sry. In contrast to the testis pathway, no single sex-determining factor has been identified in the ovary pathway; however, multiple genes, such as Foxl2, Rspo1, Ctnnb1, and Wnt4, seem to work synergistically and in parallel to ensure proper ovary development. Our understanding of the regulatory networks that underpin testis and ovary development has grown substantially over the past two decades.",

The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics and maintenance dose recommendations of vancomycin in severe pneumonia patients receiving CVVH.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective study was conducted in the intensive care unit of a university hospital. Ten severe pneumonia patients receiving vancomycin and CVVH treatment were determined the initial and steady-state pharmacokinetics of vancomycin. CVVH was performed in mixed predilution and postdilution mode with a blood flow rate of 180 mL/min and an ultrafiltrate flow rate of 30-40 mL/kg/h. Group A received an initial dose of 500 mg only, whereas group B received 500 mg every 12 h until steady state is achieved. Serum and ultrafiltrate were collected over 12 h after infusion of vancomycin.<h4>Results</h4>After initial dosing, the mean sieving coefficient (SC) was 0.72 ± 0.02, and CVVH clearance (CL<sub>CVVH</sub>, 1.35 ± 0.03 L/h) constituted 60.55% ± 13.69% of total vancomycin clearance (CL<sub>tot</sub>, 2.36 ± 0.72 L/h). When steady state was reached, the SC of the patients was 0.71 ± 0.03, and the CL<sub>CVVH</sub> (1.34 ± 0.06 L/h) accounted for 66.96% ± 6.05% of the CL<sub>tot</sub> (2.03 ± 0.27 L/h). The recommended maintenance dose for vancomycin in severe pneumonia patients was 400-650 mg every 12 h, which was calculated based on CL<sub>tot</sub>, to achieve a trough concentration of 15-20 mg/L at steady state.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Single administration or multiple administration does not affect SC and CL<sub>CVVH</sub>. Owing to therapeutic vancomycin levels is difficult to maintain in severe pneumonia patients who are receiving IV vancomycin therapy while on CVVH, close monitoring of serum trough concentrations is required.",

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a rare disease that can cause severe dehydration along with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia because of renal tubular unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. Autosomal dominant PHA1 (ADPHA1, OMIM #177735) is caused by inactivating mutations in the <i>NR3C2</i> gene, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor, and it can lead to renal salt-wasting, dehydration, and failure to thrive during infancy. Here, we report a case of a 20-day-old female neonate who presented as severe dehydration with hyponatremia and polyuria. We suspected that her diagnosis might be PHA1 based on markedly elevated plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels. For the genetic diagnosis of PHA1, we performed targeted exome sequencing of all causative genes of PHA1, but the result was negative. We confirmed by chromosomal microarray that a novel heterozygous microdeletion was found in the 4q31.23 region spanning exons 7-9 of the <i>NR3C2</i> gene, and the patient was diagnosed with ADPHA1.

From 15,950 articles screened, 12 were identified as ""randomised or quasi-randomised"" controlled trials, and five were included for data extraction.<h4>Data extraction</h4>Five studies with 406 participants were analysed. Descriptive and outcome data were extracted. The main outcome measure was mortality in hospital. The incidence of hospital acquired pneumonia, length of stay in a critical care unit, and duration of artificial ventilation were also recorded. Random effects meta-analyses were performed.<h4>Results</h4>Early tracheostomy did not significantly alter mortality (relative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.39). The risk of pneumonia was also unaltered by the timing of tracheostomy (0.90, 0.66 to 1.21). Early tracheostomy significantly reduced duration of artificial ventilation (weighted mean difference -8.5 days, 95% confidence interval -15.3 to -1.7) and length of stay in intensive care (-15.3 days, -24.6 to -6.1).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In critically ill adult patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation, performing a tracheostomy at an earlier stage than is currently practised may shorten the duration of artificial ventilation and length of stay in intensive care.",

In the present study, molecular techniques were applied to determine the pathogenesis of uterine carcinosarcomas. The patterns of chromosome X inactivation were analyzed, targeting a portion of exon 1 of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) in malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components. The presence of p53 and K-ras mutations were also analyzed. H&E-stained sections of paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissues were microdissected to obtain both epithelial and nonepithelial lesions from 25 carcinosarcomas, and DNAs were extracted by proteinase K digestion. Following treatment with methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease (HhaI or HpaII), PCR amplification was performed using nested primers targeted to the HUMARA locus. Mutations in the p53 gene and K-ras gene were found in eight (32%) and six (24%) tumors, respectively. The patterns of chromosome X inactivation were different between the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components of three carcinosarcomas, indicating that these three tumors represent collision tumors. By contrast, the patterns of chromosome X inactivation, K-ras sequence, and p53 sequence were identical in both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components in 21 carcinosarcomas, indicating that these 21 tumors represent combination tumors. One case produced equivocal results that precluded determination of whether it represented a collision or combination tumor. These observations show that although most carcinosarcomas are combination tumors, some develop as collision tumors. The determination of histogenesis in individual cases of carcinosarcoma using molecular markers may be worthwhile, because the result could help predict the prognosis of individual cases and help guide clinical management.",

Pathologic classification and optimal therapies are debated. We report the clinicopathologic features, treatment and survival of a series of patients with stage IV LCNEC.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Cases of pathologically-confirmed stage IV LCNEC evaluated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 2006 to 2013 were identified. We collected demographic, treatment, and survival data. Available radiology was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-nine patients with stage IV LCNEC were identified. The median age was 64 years, 63% of patients were male, and 88% were smokers. Twenty-three patients (n = 23/49; 47%) had brain metastases, 17 at diagnosis and 6 during the disease course. Seventeen LCNEC patients (35%) had molecular testing, of which 24% had KRAS mutations (n = 4/17). Treatment data for first-line metastatic disease was available on 37 patients: 70% (n = 26) received platinum/etoposide and 30% (n = 11) received other regimens. RECIST was completed on 23 patients with available imaging; objective response rate was 37% (95% confidence interval, 16%-62%) with platinum/etoposide, while those treated with other first-line regimens did not achieve a response.

The cattle were infected through direct contact with an experimentally inoculated calf. All experimental cattle shed faecal BCV with development of diarrhoea, being profusely watery with small amounts of blood in the most severely affected animals, including both cows and calves. The cows, in contrast to the calves, showed depressed general condition and appetite leading to a marked decrease in milk yield. Further age-associated differences were a shorter incubation period in the two youngest calves, but with milder fever and milder decrease in white blood cell counts. These findings shed light on the apparent epidemiological differences between WD and calf BCV diarrhoea suggesting that, (1) the same strains of BCV cause natural outbreaks of calf diarrhoea and WD, (2) seronegative cows are more severely affected by the infection than seronegative conventionally reared calves, and (3) unaffected general condition in diarrhoeic calves may lead to underestimation of the occurrence of calf diarrhoea in WD outbreaks. In response to infection, all cattle produced early interferon type 1 in serum and, except for one calf, in nasal secretions. A finding not previously reported is the detection of interferon type 1 responses in bovine milk. All cattle developed high IgM antibody responses and long-lasting IgA antibody responses both systemically and locally. The serum IgM antibody responses came earlier in most of the calves than in the cows. Prolonged IgM antibody responses were detected in serum and milk, while those in nasal secretions were much shorter. BCV-specific IgA was present in nasal secretions from all cattle throughout the 6 months follow-up. The IgA antibody response in serum was detected up to 17 months post-infection and the duration showed an age-related variation indicating a more prominent IgA memory in the adult cattle and in the older calves than in the younger ones. BCV-specific IgG was detected in all cattle during the experimental period of up to 22 months. In conclusion, WD was reproduced in seronegative lactating cows.

In MF, most infiltrating cells in patches and plaques express CXCR3, while tumor cells express CCR4 in advanced stages. Poteligeo Test IHC (CCR4 staining kit) is a newly developed staining kit that can examine the presence of CCR4 expressed on tumor cells of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma before treatment of anti-CCR4 antibody using paraffin-embedded samples. In this study, we analyzed CCR4 expression in lesional skin of MF, SS, atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis with this new kit. CCR4 was expressed on infiltrating cells in lesional skin of patch, plaque, tumor MF and SS, and the number of positive cells increased as the disease progressed. Immunohistochemistry with frozen sections also showed some positive cells scattered in the dermis, although the quality was not high enough to quantify positive cells. There were significant positive correlations between CCR4(+) cells and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Interestingly, CCR4(+) cells were also detected in AD skin, whose number was larger than that in psoriatic skin. Previous studies showed only scattered CCR4(+) cells in skin samples by standard immunohistochemical staining. The new, sensitive CCR4 staining kit has revealed that CCR4 is expressed on infiltrating cells in lesional skin of early MF and AD as well as advanced MF and SS. These cells can be therapeutic targets for patients who are resistant to standard treatments.",

Interaction of obscurin with the Z-disk is mediated by Z-disk titin. Here, we unravel the molecular basis for the unusual localization of obscurin, a Z-disk-associated protein, to the M-band, where its invertebrate analogue UNC-89 is also localized. The first three domains of the N-terminus of obscurin bind to the most C-terminal domain of M-band titin, as well as to the M-band protein myomesin. Both proteins also interact with the N-terminal domains of obscurin-like 1 (Obsl1), a small homologue of obscurin. Downregulation of myomesin by siRNA interference disrupts obscurin-M-band integration in neonatal cardiomyocytes, as does overexpression of the binding sites on either myomesin, obscurin or Obsl1. Furthermore, all titin mutations that have been linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2J (LGMD2J) or Salih myopathy weaken or abrogate titin-obscurin and titin-Obsl1 binding, and lead to obscurin mislocalization, suggesting that interference with the interaction of these proteins might be of pathogenic relevance for human disease.",

Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.<h4>Methods</h4>The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.<h4>Results</h4>The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.",

The clinical presentation of abdominal pregnancy varies, and the diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion. Ultrasonography is useful for early diagnosis of the condition. The management depends on the gestation at presentation; for advanced abdominal pregnancy, surgical intervention is recommended. The treatment of the placenta is a matter of controversy. In general, expectant management is suggested. When the placenta is left behind, the use of prophylactic methrotrexate is not advocated. An awareness of abdominal pregnancy is very important for reducing associated morbidity and mortality.",

The primary end points were vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe-critical coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) with an onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration among participants in the per-protocol population who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Safety was also assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2-negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo. Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs. 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs. 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8). Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe-critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at ≥14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at ≥28 days). Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe-critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe-critical disease, including hospitalization and death. Safety appeared to be similar to that in other phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccines.

Four major advances provide a detailed anatomy and physiology of thirst, taste for water, and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) release: ( a) Thirst and AVP release are regulated by the classical homeostatic, interosensory plasma osmolality negative feedback as well as by novel, exterosensory, anticipatory signals. These anticipatory signals for thirst and vasopressin release concentrate on the same homeostatic neurons and circumventricular organs that monitor the composition of blood. ( b) Acid-sensing taste receptor cells (TRCs) expressing otopetrin 1 on type III presynaptic TRCs on the tongue, which were previously suggested as the sour taste sensors, also mediate taste responses to water. ( c) Dehydration is aversive, and median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) neuron activity is proportional to the intensity of this aversive state. ( d) MnPO<sup>GLP1R</sup> neurons serve as a central detector that discriminates fluid ingestion from solid ingestion, which promotes acute satiation of thirst through the subfornical organ and other downstream targets.",

It is identified as a perception influenced by the complex interactions of biological, psychological, and social factors. Different types of pain and their comorbidities dramatically affect patients' quality of life and their families. Due to diverse etiology and pathogenesis, pain management represents a controversial issue in clinical practice. In 1986, the WHO developed a three-step ladder model based on the use of analgesics for pain management according to pain intensity in a linear up or down movement. Despite its huge value for pain relief, this model has some limitations, and some controversies in the pharmacotherapy of pain management have arisen so far. To bypass these difficulties, the concept of WHO analgesic ladder has been contested and changed into a four bidirectional step model which postulates the use of the invasive procedures (neuromodulatory and neurosurgical procedures). Moreover, with the introduction of the neuromatrix theory for dealing the acute and the chronic pain, the WHO model was newly reinterpreted and changed into a platform analgesic model that includes multimodal pharmacological and alternative treatments applicable to all pain conditions, although excludes the precision therapies. Here, we summarize and revise these concepts in order to propose a new model termed ""trolley analgesic model"" that will allow adopting tailored therapies with dynamic multimodal approaches for pain management according to 1) the pain intensity, 2) the physiopathology of pain, 3) the complexity of symptoms, 4) the presence of comorbidity, and 5) the physiopathological factors and the social context.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=48154

Although a public health concern, much less is known about the neurocognitive basis of suicidal behavior in elderly. Here, we aimed at assessing alterations in cognitive inhibition, a suspected major mechanism of the suicidal vulnerability, in suicidal depressed elderly.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared 20 currently depressed patients, aged 65 and older who recently attempted suicide to 20 elderly subjects with a current depression but no personal history of suicide attempt and 20 elderly controls. Using an extensive neuropsychological battery, we particularly examined different aspects of cognitive inhibition: access to relevant information (using the Reading with distraction task), suppression of no longer relevant information (Trail Making Test, Rule Shift Cards), and restraint of cognitive resources to relevant information (Stroop test, Hayling Sentence Completion test, Go/No-Go).<h4>Results</h4>After adjustment for age, intensity of depression, Mini-Mental State Examination score and speed of information processing, suicidal depressed elderly showed significant impairments in all 3 domains of cognitive inhibition in comparison to both control groups.<h4>Limitations</h4>Our results need replication in a larger sample size.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study suggests that the inability to inhibit neutral information access to working memory, restrain and delete irrelevant information may impair the patient's capacity to respond adequately to stressful situations subsequently leading to an increased risk of suicidal behavior during late-life depression. Interventions may be developed to specifically target cognitive impairment in the prevention of suicide in depressed elderly.",

Initially, clinical status and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated syndrome of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Due to clinical progression and high papillary stasis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was performed only after ventriculoperitoneal shunt was implanted. This led to a significant although transient clinical improvement. Futher investigations led to the diagnosis of invasive lobular breast carcinoma and repeated CSF analysis revealed malignant breast carcinoma cells. In this case LC was an initial presentation of a malignant-disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In the presence of a high clinical suspicion of LC, in spite of initially negative findings, a clinician should persist in repeating relevant tests, such are MRI with larger amounts of gadolinium and high-volume cytological CSF analyses in order to make the diagnosis.",

Molecular basis of disease,"Drug-induced liver injury includes a spectrum of pathologies, some related to the mode of injury, some to the cell type primarily damaged. Among these, drug-induced bile duct injury is characterized by the destruction of the biliary epithelium following exposure to a drug. Most of the drugs associated with bile duct injury cause immune-mediated lesions to the epithelium of interlobular ducts. These share common histopathological features with primary biliary cholangitis, such as inflammation and necrosis at the expense of cholangiocytes and, if the insult persists, bile duct loss and biliary cirrhosis. Some drugs selectively target larger ducts. Such injury is often dose-dependent and thought to be the result of intrinsic drug toxicity. The histological changes resemble those seen in primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Suicidal ideation usually precedes a suicide attempt. If prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is a biomarker for suicidal ideation in depression, monitoring it could be useful for suicide prevention. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the association between prefrontal function and suicidal ideation in MDD.<h4>Methods</h4>Prefrontal function in 67 patients with MDD (31 with suicidal ideation and 36 without) and 67 age-, gender-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls (HCs) was evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a verbal fluency task (VFT). Suicidal ideation was assessed using item 3 of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD).<h4>Results</h4>Regional hemodynamic changes were significantly smaller in patients with MDD than in HCs in prefrontal and temporal regions. Hemodynamic changes in the right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and right frontopolar cortex (FPC) regions in patients with MDD with suicidal ideation were significantly smaller than in those without suicidal ideation. In addition, hemodynamic changes correlated negatively with the severity of suicidal ideation in the DLPFC, OFC, and FPC in patients with MDD.<h4>Limitations</h4>Further studies with a larger sample size are required to verify our findings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that the DLPFC, OFC, and FPC are brain substrates of suicidal ideation in depressive states in patients with MDD, and that NIRS data can be employed as a clinically useful biomarker for the assessment of suicide risk.",

Although most of the infected individuals are asymptomatic, a proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease with multiple organ injuries. Evidence suggests that some medications used to treat autoimmune rheumatologic diseases might have therapeutic effect in patients with severe COVID-19 infections, drawing attention to the relationship between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. COVID-19 shares similarities with autoimmune diseases in clinical manifestations, immune responses and pathogenic mechanisms. Robust immune reactions participate in the pathogenesis of both disease conditions. Autoantibodies as a hallmark of autoimmune diseases can also be detected in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some patients have been reported to develop autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain--Barré syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, after COVID-19 infection. It is speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can disturb self-tolerance and trigger autoimmune responses through cross-reactivity with host cells. The infection risk and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune diseases remains controversial, but patient adherence to medication regimens to prevent autoimmune disease flares is strongly recommended.<h4>Summary</h4>We present a review of the association between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases, focusing on similarities in immune responses, cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2, the development of autoimmune diseases in COVID-19 patients and the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with preexisting autoimmune conditions.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7880581?pdf=render

Previously considered primarily an injury of military personnel, femoral-neck fatigue fractures are becoming increasingly more common among nonmilitary athletes. The pathogenesis of this condition is multifactorial. Ultimately, fracture is thought to be caused by repetitive submaximal stresses that occur with a frequency that exceeds the adaptive ability of the bone. The clinical hallmark of a femoral-neck fatigue fracture in an impact-loading athlete is nonspecific, activity-related hip pain that is relieved by rest. Plain radiographs obtained initially are often negative. Radionuclide imaging is useful but not specific. Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated better specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy than are available with other modalities in the diagnosis of this injury. Treatment of compression-side injuries is generally conservative. Treatment of tension-side injuries remains controversial. The authors recommend aggressive treatment of tension-side injuries to prevent the potentially catastrophic sequelae of displacement, which include osteonecrosis, malunion, and coxarthrosis.",

Deep brain stimulation (DBS), already widely utilized for Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, is an emerging therapy for select and severe cases of TS that are resistant to medication and behavioral therapy. Over the last two decades, DBS has been used experimentally to manage severe TS cases. The results of case reports and small case series have been variable but in general positive. The reported interventions have, however, been variable, and there remain non-standardized selection criteria, various brain targets, differences in hardware, as well as variability in the programming parameters utilized. DBS centers perform only a handful of TS DBS cases each year, making large-scale outcomes difficult to study and to interpret. These limitations, coupled with the variable effect of surgery, and the overall small numbers of TS patients with DBS worldwide, have delayed regulatory agency approval (e.g., FDA and equivalent agencies around the world). The Tourette Association of America, in response to the worldwide need for a more organized and collaborative effort, launched an international TS DBS registry and database. The main goal of the project has been to share data, uncover best practices, improve outcomes, and to provide critical information to regulatory agencies. The international registry and database has improved the communication and collaboration among TS DBS centers worldwide. In this paper we will review some of the key operation details for the international TS DBS database and registry.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00170/pdf

Radiation doses to 5 volumes were measured.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Pretreatment and posttreatment comparisons were performed with regard to change in tumor size; radiation dose to specific volumes including the internal auditory canal, cochlea, basal turn of the cochlea, and modiolus; and conformity of the treatment.<h4>Results</h4>The mean follow-up was 63.76 months (standard deviation, ±29.02 mo; range, 9-109 mo). The median follow-up was 65.5 months. A statistically significant association between maximum radiation dose to the cochlea volume and 3-frequency pure-tone average in patients starting with 50 dB or lesser PTA3 was demonstrated using linear regression analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Longitudinal changes in hearing occur over time, with the largest changes seen in the first 12 months after treatment. With our study outcomes as basis, limiting the dose of radiation to the cochlea to no more than 4 Gy would likely reduce vascular injury to the stria vascularis and improve hearing outcomes. Shielding the cochlea during the treatment planning process would be one mechanism to accomplish this goal.",

Functional tumors present with virilization, feminization, or hypercortisolism. Feminizing adrenal tumors, though rare in pediatrics, need to be excluded in any child presenting with features of feminization.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We report a case of a 4-year-old Sudanese girl who presented with gradually progressive bilateral breast enlargement and accelerated growth since the age of 6 months. The family had sought medical advice several times in numerous health facilities without much gain. Investigations showed pubertal luteinizing hormone levels, high estradiol E2, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, with normal early morning cortisol level. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a right-sided hypoechoic suprarenal mass. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed a right adrenal mass. The diagnosis of feminizing adrenal neoplasm was confirmed and right adrenalectomy was done. Histopathological examination of the resected adrenal gland showed adrenocortical adenoma.

Stroke may occur at any age; however, most strokes occur in individuals aged 65 years and older. Previous research has found that stroke increases suicide risk, especially among women and younger patients. The aim of the current review is to investigate the relationship between suicide and stroke in order to determine which stroke patients are at elevated risk for suicide. Moreover, we review the literature in order to provide pharmacological treatment strategies for stroke patients at high risk of suicide. We performed a careful search to identify articles and book chapters focused on this issue, selecting only English-language articles published from 1990 to 2014 that addressed the issue of suicide after stroke and its pharmacological management. We found 12 clinical trials that explored the relationship between stroke and suicidal ideation and/or suicidal plans and 11 investigating suicide as the cause of death after stroke. We identified stroke as a significant risk factor for both suicide and suicidal ideation, especially among younger adult depressed patients in all articles, providing further support for the association between post-stroke and suicidality. Suicide risk is particularly high in the first 5 years following stroke. Depression, previous mood disorder, prior history of stroke, and cognitive impairment were found to be the most important risk factors for suicide. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) represent the treatment of choice for stroke survivors with suicide risk, and studies in rats have suggested that carbolithium is a promising treatment in these patients. Early identification and treatment of post-stroke depression may significantly reduce suicide risk in stroke patients.",

Demographic, clinical, seroimmunological data were compared between patients with and without CNS involvement. Neuroimaging data were also analysed.<h4>Results</h4>CNS involvement was detected in 25 (5.8%) patients (24 females and 1 male) both at disease onset (52%) and later (48%) with a mean latency after diagnosis of 7 years. Diffuse (40%), focal/multifocal (36%), multiple sclerosis (MS)-like disease (20%) and isolated optic neuritis (4%) were the most common CNS clinical pictures. Disease duration, lung involvement and decreased C(4) were associated with CNS involvement, while articular manifestations were more frequently observed in patients without neurological complications. Most cases had an acute, often recurrent course with spontaneous remission or only mild neurological impairment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CNS involvement represents a rare but not negligible complication of pSS, which may occur with a bimodal temporal pattern, both at onset and later, prompting attention in the differential diagnosis of apparently isolated neurological syndromes. Lung involvement emerged as the strongest risk factor for CNS involvement with a relative risk of 7.9, along with disease duration and decreased C(4).",

Clinical and histologic observations have suggested that the hearing loss may be caused by both retrocochlear and cochlear mechanisms. Our goal was to perform a detailed assessment of cochlear pathology in patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS).<h4>Study design</h4>Retrospective analysis of temporal bone histopathology.<h4>Setting</h4>Multi-center study.<h4>Material</h4>Temporal bones from 32 patients with unilateral, sporadic VS within the internal auditory canal.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Sections through the cochleae on the VS side and opposite (control) ear were evaluated for loss of inner and outer hair cells, atrophy of the stria vascularis, loss of cochlear neurons, and presence of endolymphatic hydrops and precipitate within the endolymph or perilymph. Observed pathologies were correlated to nerve of origin, VS volume, and distance of VS from the cochlea. Hearing thresholds also were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>VS caused significantly more inner and outer hair cell loss, cochlear neuronal loss, precipitate in endolymph and perilymph, and decreased pure tone average, when compared with the opposite ear. Tumor size, distance from the cochlea, and nerve of origin did not correlate with structural changes in the cochlea or the hearing threshold.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is significant degeneration of cochlear structures in ears with VS. Cochlear dysfunction may be an important contributor to the hearing loss caused by VS and can explain certain clinically observed phenomena in patients with VS.",

In some patients, however, TS progresses into adulthood, and proves to be medically refractory. The authors conducted a prospective double-blind crossover trial of bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) in five adults with TS.<h4>Methods</h4>Bilateral thalamic electrodes were implanted. An independent programmer established optimal stimulator settings in a single session. Subjective and objective results were assessed in a double-blind randomized manner for 4 weeks, with each week spent in one of four states of unilateral or bilateral stimulation. Results were similarly assessed 3 months after unblinded bilateral stimulator activation while repeated open programming sessions were permitted.<h4>Results</h4>In the randomized phase of the trial, a statistically significant (p < 0.03, Friedman exact test) reduction in the modified Rush Video-Based Rating Scale score (primary outcome measure) was identified in the bilateral on state. Improvement was noted in motor and sonic tic counts as well as on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale and TS Symptom List scores (secondary outcome measures). Benefit was persistent after 3 months of open stimulator programming. Quality of life indices were also improved. Three of five patients had marked improvement according to all primary and secondary outcome measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Bilateral thalamic DBS appears to reduce tic frequency and severity in some patients with TS who have exhausted other available means of treatment.",

This international study was initiated to clarify epidemiology and the genetic underlying cause in these families, and to characterise the phenotype in our large cohort.<h4>Methods</h4>DNA samples of all currently known families with HMERF without molecular genetic cause were obtained from 12 families in seven different countries. Clinical, histopathological and muscle imaging data were collected and five biopsy samples made available for further immunohistochemical studies. Genotyping, exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were used to identify and confirm sequence variations.<h4>Results</h4>All patients with clinical diagnosis of HMERF were genetically solved by five different titin mutations identified. One mutation has been reported while four are novel, all located exclusively in the FN3 119 domain (A150) of A-band titin. One of the new mutations showed semirecessive inheritance pattern with subclinical myopathy in the heterozygous parents. Typical clinical features were respiratory failure at mid-adulthood in an ambulant patient with very variable degree of muscle weakness. Cytoplasmic bodies were retrospectively observed in all muscle biopsy samples and these were reactive for myofibrillar proteins but not for titin.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report an extensive collection of families with HMERF with five different mutations in exon 343 of TTN, which establishes this exon as the primary target for molecular diagnosis of HMERF. Our relatively large number of new families and mutations directly implies that HMERF is not extremely rare, not restricted to Northern Europe and should be considered in undetermined myogenic respiratory failure.",

MCL1 is one of the anti-apoptotic proteins. Chidamide targets the MCL1 protein, which may permit venetoclax resistance when upregulated. We determined MCL1 protein expression in different AML cell lines, and chidamide could downregulate MCL1 expression in venetoclax resistance AML cells.

Methods Clinical data and imaging follow-up were stored in a database of 1,378 patients, with 1,384 VS treated consecutively between 2005 and 2018 and analyzed retrospectively. A total of 996 patients with 1,002 tumors with at least one year of follow-up were included for analysis. Results Median follow-up was 3·6 years (1-12·5 years). The three, five, and 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimated local tumor control was 96·6%, 92·3%, and 90·8%, respectively. The median hearing loss of the affected ear as compared to its healthy counterpart was 17 dB at treatment start and increased to 23 and 29 dB at one and five years. Six patients (0·6%) developed symptomatic hydrocephalus and underwent the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. In 30 patients (3·0%), trigeminal sensory dysfunction developed, five patients (0·5%) had a mild transient weakness, and nine patients (0·9%) had a permanent facial weakness (House-Brackmann Grade > II) after SRS.

We show that this resistance reflects ABT-737's inability to target another prosurvival relative, Mcl-1. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by several strategies conferred sensitivity to ABT-737. Furthermore, enforced Mcl-1 expression in a mouse lymphoma model conferred resistance. In contrast, cells overexpressing Bcl-2 remained highly sensitive to ABT-737. Hence, ABT-737 should prove efficacious in tumors with low Mcl-1 levels, or when combined with agents that inactivate Mcl-1, even to treat those tumors that overexpress Bcl-2.",

The general types of treatment modalities for aneurysms and visual deficits include surgery and endosaccular coiling. This study retrospectively analyzed and compared the resolution of visual deficits following surgery or endosaccular coiling.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed data on 33 patients with unruptured ICA aneurysms who presented with visual field deficits caused by mass effects over the anterior optic pathway. Statistical analyses were performed to identify the variables associated with the recovery of visual symptoms.<h4>Results</h4>Eighteen patients underwent aneurysm clipping, 2 underwent bypass surgery with endovascular trapping, and 2 underwent endovascular trapping without bypass surgery (group A). Ten patients received endosaccular coiling (group B). The visual outcomes included the following: in group A, 17 patients (73.9%) demonstrated improvement and 6 patients (26.1%) demonstrated no changes or worse outcomes; in group B, 2 patients (20.0%) demonstrated improvement and 8 patients (80.0%) demonstrated no changes or worse outcomes. Group A was associated with a higher rate of favorable outcome than group B (P = 0.007).

Oncology,"<h4>Background</h4>Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer with poor prognosis in patients with advanced disease. Current standard care uses various cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, but responses are seldom durable. Tumour oncogenesis is linked to Merkel cell polyomavirus integration and ultraviolet-radiation-induced mutations, providing rationale for treatment with immunotherapy antibodies that target the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway. We assessed treatment with avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with stage IV Merkel cell carcinoma that had progressed after cytotoxic chemotherapy.<h4>Methods</h4>In this multicentre, international, prospective, single-group, open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with stage IV chemotherapy-refractory, histologically confirmed Merkel cell carcinoma (aged ≥18 years) were enrolled from 35 cancer treatment centres and academic hospitals in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Key eligibility criteria were an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function, and immune-competent status (patients with HIV, immunosuppression, haematological malignancies, and previous organ transplantation were excluded). Patient selection was not based on PD-L1 expression or Merkel cell polyomavirus status. Collection of biopsy material or use of archival tissue for these assessments was mandatory. Avelumab was given intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response (complete response or partial response) assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 by an independent review committee. Safety and clinical activity were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (the modified intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02155647.<h4>Findings</h4>Between July 25, 2014, and Sept 3, 2015, 88 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of avelumab. Patients were followed up for a median of 10·4 months (IQR 8·6-13·1). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 28 (31·8% [95·9% CI 21·9-43·1]) of 88 patients, including eight complete responses and 20 partial responses. Responses were ongoing in 23 (82%) of 28 patients at the time of analysis. Five grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in four (5%) patients: lymphopenia in two patients, blood creatine phosphokinase increase in one patient, aminotransferase increase in one patient, and blood cholesterol increase in one patient; there were no treatment-related grade 4 adverse events or treatment-related deaths. Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in five patients (6%): enterocolitis, infusion-related reaction, aminotransferases increased, chondrocalcinosis, synovitis, and interstitial nephritis (n=1 each).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Avelumab was associated with durable responses, most of which are still ongoing, and was well tolerated; hence, avelumab represents a new therapeutic option for advanced Merkel cell carcinoma.<h4>Funding</h4>Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.",

Nephrology,"Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to an infection that leads to organ dysfunction. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of organ failure in sepsis is crucial for optimizing the management and treatment of patients and for the development of potential new therapies. In clinical practice, six major organ systems - the cardiovascular (including the microcirculation), respiratory, renal, neurological, haematological and hepatic systems - can be assessed and monitored, whereas others, such as the gut, are less accessible. Over the past 2 decades, considerable amounts of new data have helped improve our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology, including the regulation of inflammatory pathways and the role played by immune suppression during sepsis. The effects of impaired cellular function, including mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cell death mechanisms, on the development of organ dysfunction are also being unravelled. Insights have been gained into interactions between key organs (such as the kidneys and the gut) and organ-organ crosstalk during sepsis. The important role of the microcirculation in sepsis is increasingly apparent, and new techniques have been developed that make it possible to visualize the microcirculation at the bedside, although these techniques are only research tools at present.",

Although bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strains are frequently circulating in cattle farms worldwide, causing both enteric and respiratory disease, little is known about their genomic evolution. We sequenced and analysed the full-length spike (S) protein gene of 33 BCoV strains from dairy and feedlot farms collected during outbreaks that occurred from 2002 to 2010 in Sweden and Denmark. Amino acid identities were >97 % for the BCoV strains analysed in this work. These strains formed a clade together with Italian BCoV strains and were highly similar to human enteric coronavirus HECV-4408/US/94. A high similarity was observed between BCoV, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Molecular clock analysis of the S gene sequences estimated BCoV and CRCoV diverged from a common ancestor in 1951, while the time of divergence from a common ancestor of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 was estimated to be 1899. BCoV strains showed the lowest similarity to equine coronavirus, placing the date of divergence at the end of the eighteenth century. Two strongly positive selection sites were detected along the receptor-binding subunit of the S protein gene: spanning amino acid residues 109-131 and 495-527. By contrast, the fusion subunit was observed to be under negative selection. The selection pattern along the S glycoprotein implies adaptive evolution of BCoVs, suggesting a successful mechanism for BCoV to continuously circulate among cattle and other ruminants without disappearance.",

Most of cases reported in literature are related to maxillary molar teeth. Odontogenic infections are not common causes of orbital abscess but it should always be put in consideration when dealing with orbital cellulitis and abscess.<h4>Case presentation</h4>This is a case of orbital abscess involving the left eye as consequence of lower left third molar infection in otherwise healthy 35-year-old black male patient. CT scan confirmed the unusual pathway of this space infection from the lower third molar and excluded any intracranial involvement. The abscess was drained immediately by intraoral incisions and the tooth was extracted. There was a dramatic improvement in a very short time with normal eye movement.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This case demonstrates one of the serious consequences of odontogenic infection which may lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis and blindness if not treated promptly.,

Two phase III trials demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) and a favorable safety profile with the anti-programmed death-1 antibody nivolumab versus docetaxel in patients with previously treated advanced squamous (CheckMate 017) and nonsquamous (CheckMate 057) NSCLC. We report results from ≥3 years' follow-up, including subgroup analyses of patients with liver metastases, who historically have poorer prognosis among patients with NSCLC.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) until progression or discontinuation. The primary end point of each study was OS. Patients with baseline liver metastases were pooled across studies by treatment for subgroup analyses.<h4>Results</h4>After 40.3 months' minimum follow-up in CheckMate 017 and 057, nivolumab continued to show an OS benefit versus docetaxel: estimated 3-year OS rates were 17% [95% confidence interval (CI), 14% to 21%] versus 8% (95% CI, 6% to 11%) in the pooled population with squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC. Nivolumab was generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns identified. Of 854 randomized patients across both studies, 193 had baseline liver metastases. Nivolumab resulted in improved OS compared with docetaxel in patients with liver metastases (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91), consistent with findings from the overall pooled study population (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81). Rates of treatment-related hepatic adverse events (primarily grade 1-2 liver enzyme elevations) were slightly higher in nivolumab-treated patients with liver metastases (10%) than in the overall pooled population (6%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>After 3 years' minimum follow-up, nivolumab continued to demonstrate an OS benefit versus docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC. Similarly, nivolumab demonstrated an OS benefit versus docetaxel in patients with liver metastases, and remained well tolerated.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>CheckMate 017: NCT01642004; CheckMate 057: NCT01673867.",

Aneurysms originated from the right (n = 5), noncoronary (n = 3) and left coronary sinus (n = 1) and entered into right ventricle (n = 5), right atrium (n = 3). In one patient, ASV originated from the left coronary sinus and unruptured. Coexistent cardiac lesions were aortic valve insufficiency (n = 4), ventricular septal defect (n = 5), patent foramen ovale (n = 1), right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n = 1) and coronary artery anomaly (n = 2). All patients were symptomatic (sudden onset of symptoms in 3, gradual onset in 6).<h4>Interventions</h4>Ruptured ASVs were repaired by double approach in which both the involved chamber and the aortic root. Concomitant aortic surgery was performed in four patients (2 replacement, 2 valvuloplasty). VSDs were closed by patch in 4 and by direct suture in 1.<h4>Results</h4>The incidence of coexisting coronary artery anomaly was 22.2%. There was no hospital and late mortality.

Although only 5% of patients with breast cancer develop leptomeningeal involvement, it remains the most common etiology of LC. It can occur as a late-stage complication of systemic progression or present as the first sign of metastatic disease, with or without parenchymal brain metastases. Lobular carcinomas have a higher propensity to metastasize into the meninges when compared to ductal carcinoma, especially the triple-negative subtype, which usually is associated with a shorter interval between metastatic breast cancer diagnosis and the development of LC. Prognosis remains poor, with median survival of 4 months for patients receiving state-of-the-art treatment. The main factors associated with survival are performance status at diagnosis, CSF protein level and triple-negative subtype. Headache is commonly the first clinical presentation of LC, and the diagnostic workup usually requires CSF-cytological analysis and or/MRI. The current management of LC consists of a combination of intra-CSF chemotherapy, systemic therapy, radiotherapy and/or best-supportive care. The standard intra-CSF chemotherapy regimen is methotrexate. Radiotherapy is used for relieving obstruction points on CSF-outflow channels due to ependymal nodules, tumor deposits or bulky disease. Objective responses have been reported with intrathecal administration of trastuzumab for HER2-positive disease, yet this strategy is still under investigation.

Early, aggressive treatment is recommended to prevent endocarditis or lesional enlargement, which causes worse symptoms and necessitates more extensive repair.",

Published reports suggest that the CRP is a more sensitive diagnostic indicator of GCA and can be elevated when the ESR is normal. It is also clear that the CRP and ESR can both be normal or both be elevated in patients with biopsy-proven GCA and that the CRP can be elevated when the ESR is normal. The purpose of this study was to ascertain if the CRP can be normal when the ESR is elevated in biopsy-proven GCA.<h4>Design</h4>Retrospective, longitudinal, comparative study.<h4>Participants</h4>One hundred nineteen patients from 6 major tertiary-care university-affiliated medical centers.<h4>Methods</h4>The charts from 119 patients with temporal artery biopsies positive for GCA were reviewed for age, gender, pretreatment ESR, and pretreatment CRP.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The ESR in millimeters per hour Westergren was graded as normal or abnormal based on 2 validated formulas. The CRP was graded as normal or abnormal based on established criteria set forth in the literature as well as at The Johns Hopkins Hematology laboratory.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, the ESR had a sensitivity of 76% to 86%, depending on which of 2 formulas were used, whereas an elevated CRP had a sensitivity of 97.5%. The sensitivity of the ESR and CRP together was 99%. Only 1 of the 119 patients (0.8%) presented with a normal ESR and normal CRP (double false negative); 2 patients (1.7%) had a normal CRP despite an elevated ESR according to both formulas.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although most patients with GCA have both an elevated ESR and CRP, there can be nonconcordance of the 2 blood tests. Although such nonconcordance is most often a normal ESR but an elevated CRP, the finding of an elevated ESR and a normal CRP also is consistent with GCA. The use of both tests provides a slightly greater sensitivity for the diagnosis of GCA than the use of either test alone.",

Application of a transdiagnostic framework to identify neurocognitive commonalities of SB may clarify important risk factors of SB across psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of SB using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Cognitive Systems framework to determine if cognitive deficits exist independently of psychiatric disorders in SB. The following six constructs that encompass the Cognitive Systems domain were assessed: 1) Attention, 2) Cognitive Control, 3) Declarative Memory, 4) Language, 5) Perception, and 6) Working Memory. A total of 1386 abstracts were identified and 74 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The majority of studies reviewed (65%) had significant differences in cognition between individuals with and without SB. Seventy-nine percent of studies with a patient control group showed significant cognitive deficits in SB groups. Deficits in cognitive control were associated with SB and had the greatest percentage of studies with significant main findings. Use of the RDoC cognitive systems framework to evaluate SB revealed that cognitive deficits may be a transdiagnostic risk factor for SB, especially alterations in cognitive control.",

American volume,"<h4>Background</h4>Femoral neck stress fractures are overuse injuries with devastating consequences if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. The aim of this study was to retrospectively review femoral neck stress fractures using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based protocol and to identify imaging risk factors that could predict fracture progression requiring surgical intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified all femoral neck stress fractures treated at our institution from 2002 to 2015. Inclusion criteria for the study were unilateral pathology involving either an incomplete femoral neck stress fracture with a visualized fracture line or edema without a distinct fracture line. MRI data were evaluated for edema, fracture line percentage, and hip effusion. A surgical procedure was offered to patients with fractures with interval progression on serial MRI after 6 weeks of nonoperative treatment.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 305 patients who met inclusion criteria. Initial MRI showed edema with a fracture line in 54.4% of patients and isolated edema in 45.6% of patients. Interval MRI was performed in 194 patients at a mean time of 6 weeks, and it revealed fracture progression in 13.9% of patients. There were no significant differences in the size of the fracture line on initial MRI between the group who progressed to a surgical procedure and those who resolved with nonoperative treatment (mean [and standard deviation], 24.6% ± 8.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21.4% to 27.8%] and 25.5% ± 11.1% [95% CI, 22.9% to 28.1%]; p = 0.287). Of the patients who required a surgical procedure, 85.2% had an effusion on the initial MRI compared with only 26.3% of those who showed interval resolution with nonoperative treatment. Those who had a hip effusion on the initial MRI had 8 times (relative risk, 8.02 [95% CI, 2.99 to 21.5]; p < 0.0001) the risk of fracture progression to surgical fixation compared with those without a hip effusion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In patients with a femoral neck stress fracture and fracture line, the presence of a hip effusion on the initial MRI screening is an independent risk factor for fracture progression and early prophylactic surgical intervention should be considered. All patients with isolated edema in the femoral neck without a fracture line on the initial MRI had resolution with nonoperative treatment and did not have fracture progression toward surgical fixation.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Prognostic Level IV.

In-hospital mortality or ICU length of stay (LOS) of 3 days or more was a composite secondary outcome. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Adjusted analyses were performed using a model of baseline risk determined using variables independent of the scoring systems.<h4>Results</h4>Among 184 875 patients (mean age, 62.9 years [SD, 17.4]; women, 82 540 [44.6%]; most common diagnosis bacterial pneumonia, 32 634 [17.7%]), a total of 34 578 patients (18.7%) died in the hospital, and 102 976 patients (55.7%) died or experienced an ICU LOS of 3 days or more. SOFA score increased by 2 or more points in 90.1%; 86.7% manifested 2 or more SIRS criteria, and 54.4% had a qSOFA score of 2 or more points. SOFA demonstrated significantly greater discrimination for in-hospital mortality (crude AUROC, 0.753 [99% CI, 0.750-0.757]) than SIRS criteria (crude AUROC, 0.589 [99% CI, 0.585-0.593]) or qSOFA (crude AUROC, 0.607 [99% CI, 0.603-0.611]). Incremental improvements were 0.164 (99% CI, 0.159-0.169) for SOFA vs SIRS criteria and 0.146 (99% CI, 0.142-0.151) for SOFA vs qSOFA (P <.001). SOFA (AUROC, 0.736 [99% CI, 0.733-0.739]) outperformed the other scores for the secondary end point (SIRS criteria: AUROC, 0.609 [99% CI, 0.606-0.612]; qSOFA: AUROC, 0.606 [99% CI, 0.602-0.609]). Incremental improvements were 0.127 (99% CI, 0.123-0.131) for SOFA vs SIRS criteria and 0.131 (99% CI, 0.127-0.134) for SOFA vs qSOFA (P <.001). Findings were consistent for both outcomes in multiple sensitivity analyses.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Among adults with suspected infection admitted to an ICU, an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more had greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than SIRS criteria or the qSOFA score. These findings suggest that SIRS criteria and qSOFA may have limited utility for predicting mortality in an ICU setting.",

First, it standardizes the criteria for diagnosis of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Second, it proposes a new clinical scoring system (0-3) that describes the extent and severity of chronic GVHD for each organ or site at any given time, taking functional impact into account. Third, it proposes new guidelines for global assessment of chronic GVHD severity that are based on the number of organs or sites involved and the degree of involvement in affected organs (mild, moderate, or severe). Diagnosis of chronic GVHD requires the presence of at least 1 diagnostic clinical sign of chronic GVHD (e.g., poikiloderma or esophageal web) or the presence of at least 1 distinctive manifestation (e.g., keratoconjunctivitis sicca) confirmed by pertinent biopsy or other relevant tests (e.g., Schirmer test) in the same or another organ. Furthermore, other possible diagnoses for clinical symptoms must be excluded. No time limit is set for the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. The Working Group recognized 2 main categories of GVHD, each with 2 subcategories. The acute GVHD category is defined in the absence of diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and includes (1) classic acute GVHD occurring within 100 days after transplantation and (2) persistent, recurrent, or late acute GVHD (features of acute GVHD occurring beyond 100 days, often during withdrawal of immune suppression). The broad category of chronic GVHD includes (1) classic chronic GVHD (without features or characteristics of acute GVHD) and (2) an overlap syndrome in which diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and acute GVHD appear together. It is currently recommended that systemic therapy be considered for patients who meet criteria for chronic GVHD of moderate to severe global severity.",

Although the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is rising, the risk of abdominal pregnancy, which is probably always a sequel of a missed ruptured ectopic pregnancy, is apparently declining; this may be due to improved prenatal care. However, only one of nine women who reached the hospital alive had an accurate preoperative diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy, which suggests that preventing abdominal pregnancy-related death may depend, at least in part, upon increasing physicians' awareness of its clinical features.",

However, national practices and the culture of individual ICUs influence mobilization activities.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In a 1-day, Swiss point prevalence study conducted in 35 ICUs (representing 45% of all ICUs), the highest level of mobilization for mechanically ventilated patients was characterized using the validated ICU Mobility Scale, along with data collection for potential safety events and mobilization barriers.<h4>Results</h4>Among 161 mechanically ventilated patients, a total of 33% (n = 53) had active mobilization, with walking achieved by only 2% (n = 4). More severe organ failure was associated with lower mobilization (respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score: <i>P</i> = .037, cardiac: <i>P</i> = .008, neurology: <i>P</i> < .001). Barriers to mobilization were reported in 71% (n = 115), with deep sedation significantly higher among patients receiving passive versus active mobilization (14% vs 0%, <i>P</i> = .005). Potential safety events occurred in 20% (n = 33) of patients without significant differences between passive and active mobilization. Availability of physiotherapists and appropriate equipment were not reported barriers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Mobilization during mechanical ventilation occurred infrequently with greater organ failure associated with lower mobilization. Addressing the identified modifiable barriers via structured efforts to achieve multidisciplinary culture change is essential to decrease the common use of bed rest in Swiss ICUs.",

It is arguably the main reason people seek psychiatric treatment, yet is a concept largely ignored in psychiatry. The aim here is to review and summarize the literature pertaining to demoralization in order to examine the validity of the construct.<h4>Method</h4>A narrative review of demoralization and the related concepts of hope, hopelessness, and meaning is presented, drawing on a range of empirical and observational studies in the medical and psychiatric literature.<h4>Results</h4>An examination of the concepts of the 'Giving Up-Given Up' syndrome (George Engel), 'suffering' (Eric Cassell), and demoralization (Jerome Frank), demonstrate considerable convergence of ideas. Demoralization has been commonly observed in the medically and psychiatrically ill and is experienced as existential despair, hopelessness, helplessness, and loss of meaning and purpose in life. Although sharing symptoms of distress, demoralization is distinguished from depression by subjective incompetence in the former and anhedonia in the latter. Demoralization can occur in people who are depressed, cancer patients who are not depressed and those with schizophrenia. Hopelessness, the hallmark of demoralization, is associated with poor outcomes in physical and psychiatric illness, and importantly, with suicidal ideation and the wish to die.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Demoralization is an important construct with established descriptive and predictive validity. A place needs to be found for it in psychiatric nomenclature.",

However, symptomatic brain metastases are associated with dismal prognosis, so early detection and treatment could be advisable.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with GEP-NEN and bronchopulmonary NEN excluding small cell lung cancer. All patients were treated at the University Hospital Marburg and Halle (Saale) between 2000 and 2017. The median overall survival (mOS) and mOS after diagnosis of brain metastases (BM) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Risk factors for poor prognosis were evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression method.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 51 patients with a median age of 58 years presented BM. Lung (n = 23, 45.1%) was the most frequent primary localization. Most patients had NEC (n = 31, 60.8%), including 26 carcinomas (51%) with Ki-67 indices > 55%. Singular BM were present in 16 patients (31.4%), but 21 patients (41.2%) had multiple lesions.

Eighty-five patients with hematological malignancies were randomized to be conditioned with TBI alone (n = 44) or FLU/TBI (n = 41). All patients had initial engraftment. Two graft rejections were observed, both in the TBI group. Infection rates, nonrelapse mortality, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were similar between groups. Three-year overall survival was lower in the TBI group (54% versus 65%; hazard ratio [HR], .57; P = .09), with higher incidences of relapse/progression (55% versus 40%; HR, .55; P = .06), relapse-related mortality (37% versus 28%; HR, .53; P = .09), and a lower progression-free survival (36% versus 53%; HR, .56; P = .05).

We investigated the incidence and prognostic implications of early hepatic dysfunction (serum bilirubin >2 mg/dL within 48 hrs of admission).<h4>Design</h4>Prospective, multicenter cohort study.<h4>Setting</h4>Thirty-two medical, surgical, and mixed intensive care units.<h4>Patients</h4>A total of 38,036 adult patients admitted consecutively over a period of 4 yrs.<h4>Interventions</h4>None.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Excluding patients with preexisting cirrhosis (n = 691; 1.8%) and acute or acute-on-chronic hepatic failure (n = 108, 0.3%), we identified 4,146 patients (10.9%) with early hepatic dysfunction. These patients had different baseline characteristics, longer median intensive care unit stays (5 vs. 3 days; p < .001) and increased hospital mortality (30.4% vs. 16.4%; p < .001). Hepatic dysfunction was also associated with higher observed-to-expected mortality ratios (1.02 vs. 0.91; p < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an independent mortality risk of hepatic dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-2.03; p < .001), which exceeded the impact of all other organ dysfunctions. A case-control study further confirmed these results: Patients with early hepatic dysfunction exhibited significantly increased raw and risk-adjusted mortality compared with control subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide strong evidence that early hepatic dysfunction, occurring in 11% of critically ill patients, presents a specific and independent risk factor for poor prognosis.",

Offspring of carriers have a 50% chance of carrying CTG repeat sequences in the DMPK gene, and various time-consuming methodologies have been developed for genetic diagnosis. With a novel, efficient, and precise method by karyomapping using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to diagnose single gene disorders, one could terminate the transmission of single gene disorder.

Moreover, many patients receive additional X-ray imaging, such as cardiac computed tomography and others. More and more complex procedures have the risk to increase the radiation exposure, both for the patients and the operators. The professional lifetime attributable excess cancer risk may be around 1 in 100 for the operators, the same as for a patient undergoing repetitive complex procedures. Moreover, recent reports have also hinted at an excess risk of brain tumours among interventional cardiologists. Apart from evaluating the need for and justifying the use of radiation to assist their procedures, physicians have to continuously explore ways to reduce the radiation exposure. After an introduction on how to quantify the radiation exposure and defining its current magnitude in electrophysiology compared with the other sources of radiation, this position paper wants to offer some very practical advice on how to reduce exposure to patients and staff. The text describes how customization of the X-ray system, workflow adaptations, and shielding measures can be implemented in the cath lab. The potential and the pitfalls of different non-fluoroscopic guiding technologies are discussed. Finally, we suggest further improvements that can be implemented by both the physicians and the industry in the future. We are confident that these suggestions are able to reduce patient and operator exposure by more than an order of magnitude, and therefore think that these recommendations are worth reading and implementing by any electrophysiological operator in the field.",

Guidelines for staging, treatment and follow-up are lacking.<h4>Objectives</h4>To better define staging procedures, treatment results and clinical course in adult patients with LCH first presenting in the skin.<h4>Methods</h4>Eighteen adult patients with LCH first presenting in the skin were collected from five centres collaborating in the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group. Clinical records and (skin) biopsy specimens were reviewed and follow-up data were obtained. A literature search on adult patients with LCH presenting in the skin was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Staging procedures showed extracutaneous disease in three of 16 patients who were adequately staged. One patient had a histologically confirmed lytic LCH bone lesion, while two patients had a myelodysplastic syndrome. During follow-up two of 18 patients developed extracutaneous localizations of LCH. Five patients developed a second haematological malignancy, including (myelo)monocytic leukaemia (two cases), histiocytic sarcoma (one case), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (one case) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (one case). Review of the literature revealed six other adult patients with a second haematological malignancy preceding or following a diagnosis of LCH.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of the present study suggest an increased risk of a second haematological malignancy in adult patients with LCH presenting in the skin. Extensive staging at presentation and long-term follow-up are therefore warranted in such patients.",

Patients were included in the study only if they had 1) abrupt onset of severe headache or visual disturbance in the presence of a pituitary adenoma and 2) radiological or surgical confirmation of a pituitary mass. The primary endpoints of analysis were the visual (ocular motility, visual fields, and visual acuity), endocrine, and functional outcomes (using the modified Rankin Scale).<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-seven patients were identified (57 males and 30 females, mean age 50.9 years, range 15-91 years). Twenty-two patients (25.3%) had a known pituitary adenoma. Hypertension was the most common associated factor (39%). Headache was the most frequent presenting symptom (89.7%), followed by visual abnormalities (47.1%). Cranial nerve palsies were present in 39% and visual field defects in 34.1%. MRI detected hemorrhage in 89% patients, as compared with 42% detected by CT scan. Sixty-one patients (70.1%) underwent surgery during acute hospitalization (median time from apoplexy 5 days, IQR 3-10 days), 8 (9.2%) had delayed surgery, and 18 (20.7%) were treated conservatively. Histopathological examination revealed adenoma with pure necrosis in 18 (30%), pure hemorrhage in 4 (6.7%), and both in 6 (10%) patients. Four patients died during hospitalization. The average duration of follow-up was 44.2 ± 43.8 months. All survivors were independent and had complete resolution or substantial improvement in eye movements and visual fields at the last follow-up. Many patients needed long-term hormonal replacement with levothyroxine (62.7%) and cortisol (60%). Daily desmopressin was needed in 23% of all surgical patients at 3 months (versus none of the medically treated) and this requirement decreased slightly over time. Regrowth of pituitary adenoma was seen in 7 patients (8.6%). There were no statistically significant differences in any of the outcome measures across the treatment groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The outcome of most patients with pituitary apoplexy is excellent. Selected patients can be managed conservatively, and patients with severe neuro-ophthalmological deficits treated with early surgery can achieve an excellent recovery.",

Patients were categorized into three different groups. If patients had available ophthalmic data before and after starting treatment was group 1 (n = 14), had available ophthalmic data after starting treatment in group 2 (n = 10) and had available ophthalmic data before treatment or did not have any data after starting treatment in group 3 (n = 11).

The MS cohorts consisted of 225 incidence cases (1905 to 1991) and 164 prevalence cases (December 1, 1991) of definite MS in the population of Olmsted County. We assessed the effect of mechanical trauma in the form of spinal injury or extremity fracture with regard to precipitation of MS or exacerbation of an existing neurologic deficit. Fifty-four episodes of trauma, as defined, occurred among 39 MS prevalence cases; most occurred 10 years or more after the onset of disease and were associated with existing MS-related disability. We compared the final disability status of the groups with and without trauma. We found no correlation between the occurrence of peripheral fractures and the onset of MS, exacerbation of MS, or final disability due to MS in the prevalence cohort. In a cohort of 819 head injury cases from the Olmsted County population, none developed MS within 6 months of the trauma. In a lumber disk surgery cohort of 942 local residents, there were five with MS, but onset of MS had preceded the spinal surgery in four of the five.

Clinical data were retrieved by medical records, fertility outcomes were obtained by phone follow-up. The cumulative incidence (CI) of intrauterine clinical pregnancy (CP), miscarriage, live birth (LB), and recurrent EP, and the time between treatment and first intrauterine CP were compared between women treated with MTX, surgery and expectant management.<h4>Results</h4>The CI of intrauterine CP starting from 12 months after the EP was 65.3% for the expectant management, 55.3% for the MTX group, and 39.5% for surgery (p = 0.012). Post-hoc analysis showed expectant management having higher intrauterine CP and LB, and shorter time between treatment and first intrauterine CP compared to surgery (p < 0.05). The CI of recurrent EP was comparable between the 3 groups. The analysis stratified per βhCG cut-off of 1745 mUI/mL and EP mass cut-off of 25 mm reported consistent results.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Women successfully managed by expectation appear to have better reproductive outcomes compared to women who underwent surgery, with the shortest time to achieve a subsequent intrauterine CP. Therefore, if safely applicable the expectant management should be considered in the case of tubal EP. The fact that the chosen treatment was primarily guided by the βhCG value and EP mass diameter based on the protocol, which is intrinsically related to the characteristics of the EP, represents the main limitation of the present study. Indeed, we cannot completely exclude that the observed differences between treatments are related to the EP itself instead of the treatment.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00404-020-05749-2.pdf

The diagnosis of a TTN-related myopathy is, however, often not straightforward due to clinico-pathological overlap with other myopathies and the prevalence of TTN variants in control populations. Here, we present a combined clinico-pathological, genetic and biophysical approach to the diagnosis of TTN-related myopathies and the pathogenicity ascertainment of TTN missense variants. We identified 30 patients with a primary TTN-related congenital myopathy (CM) and two truncating variants, or one truncating and one missense TTN variant, or homozygous for one TTN missense variant. We found that TTN-related myopathies show considerable overlap with other myopathies but are strongly suggested by a combination of certain clinico-pathological features. Presentation was typically at birth with the clinical course characterized by variable progression of weakness, contractures, scoliosis and respiratory symptoms but sparing of extraocular muscles. Cardiac involvement depended on the variant position. Our biophysical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations associated with CMs are strongly destabilizing and exert their effect when expressed on a truncating background or in homozygosity.

We used IASP criteria for CRPS. The study population was in the Olmsted County, Minnesota (1990 population, 106,470). The main outcome measures were CRPS I incidence, prevalence, and outcome. Seventy-four cases of CRPS I were identified, resulting in an incidence rate of 5.46 per 100,000 person years at risk, and a period prevalence of 20.57 per 100,000. Female:male ratio was 4:1, with a median age of 46 years at onset. Upper limb was affected twice as commonly as lower limb. All cases reported an antecedent event and fracture was the most common trigger (46%). Excellent concordance was found between symptoms and signs and vasomotor symptoms were the most commonly present. Three phase bone scan and autonomic testing diagnosed the condition in >80% of cases. Seventy-four percent of patients underwent resolution, often spontaneously. CRPS I is of low prevalence, more commonly affects women than men, the upper more than the lower extremity, and three out of four cases undergo resolution.

Only recently few mutations in the <i>WT1</i> (<i>WT1</i> transcription factor; 11p13) gene were described in a group of 46,XX TDSD and 46,XX OTDSD individuals.

Patient demographics, tumor features, treatment parameters, and pre- and postimplantation audiometric and clinical outcomes are presented.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen patients (18 ears) underwent SRS and ipsilateral CI during the study period. Thirteen patients (76%) had neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Median age at SRS and CI were 44 and 48 years, respectively. Median time from SRS to CI was 60 days, but notably, 4 patients underwent SRS and CI within 1 day and 5 patients underwent CI more than 7 years after SRS. Median marginal dose was 13 Gy. Median treatment volume at the time of SRS was 1400 mm3 (range 84-6080 mm3, n = 15 patients). Median post-CI PTA was 28 dB HL, improved from 101 dB HL preoperatively (p < 0.001). Overall, 11 patients (12 ears) exhibited open-set speech understanding. Sentence testing was performed at a median of 10 months (range 1-143 months) post-CI. The median AzBio sentence score for patients with open-set speech understanding was 76% (range 19%-95%, n = 10 ears). Two ears exhibited Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) sentence scores of 49% and 95%, respectively. Four patients achieved environmental sound awareness without open-set speech recognition. Two had no detectable auditory percepts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Most patients who underwent CI following SRS for VS enjoyed access to sound at near-normal levels, with the majority achieving good open-set speech understanding. Implantation can be performed immediately following SRS or in a delayed fashion, depending on hearing status as well as other factors.

We reviewed the experience of the University of Florence focusing on prognostic factors and MC survival.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We analyzed 33 patients treated for MC from BC between 2002 and 2010.<h4>Results</h4>Mean OS from MC diagnosis was 4.9 months. At survival analysis clinical stage emerged as the only statistical significant parameter (P = 0.009) among BC diagnosis features. Among MC diagnosis parameters, more than three metastases at diagnosis (P = 0.037), multimodality treatment (P = 0.014) and poor performance status (P = 0.003) reached the statistical significance. At multivariate analysis only performance status at MC diagnosis maintained the statistical significance (P = 0.0047; HR: 3.34; CI 95% 1.45-7.73).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our experience confirms that performance status is probably the most important prognostic factor in these patients. Multimodality approach is probably the best option.",

Cardiovascular interventions,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study sought to define electrographic characteristics of the fossa ovalis (FO) and use these findings in developing a 3-dimensional (3D) transseptal puncture (TSP) technique that does not rely on fluoroscopy or echocardiography.<h4>Background</h4>Traditional TSP method based on fluoroscopy or echocardiography is basically a 2-dimensional (2D) technique. A valid 3D method of TSP has not been sufficiently clarified.<h4>Methods</h4>The shape of the FO and its center were ""electrographically"" defined by comparing their potential characteristics to those of the surrounding limbus. After validation by intracardiac echocardiography, this FO mapping was incorporated into 3D electroanatomical reconstruction of the right atrium. Using a new catheter connection, the transseptal needle could be visualized nonfluoroscopically and directed to the precise localization of the FO on the electroanatomic map.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 276 patients who underwent atrial fibrillation ablation were included. The central FO was identified in all cases with atrial electrogram voltage at 0.33 ± 0.21 mV. The amplitude of atrial potential at the FO annulus was 1.70 ± 0.72 mV (p < 0.001). By incorporating the electrographically defined FO into the 3D electroanatomic mapping and using the transseptal needle visualization approach, TSP was successful in all patients, with 91% of the cases at the first attempt. Atrial fibrillation ablation was completed in all patients with no major complication.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Electrographic characteristics of the FO center are distinct from those of the surrounding regions. This information can be leveraged to define the FO on 3D electroanatomic mappings, thereby facilitating safe TSP without the need of ancillary imaging with fluoroscopy or echocardiography.",

The results were limited to the English language and to reports involving human subjects. Each abstract was reviewed to confirm that the described injury had occurred in the upper extremity and that it had truly been a high-pressure injection. The reference pages from each of the papers were reviewed to identify additional reports of high-pressure injection injury. Manuscripts describing injuries resulting from hand held syringes or other low-pressure mechanisms were excluded.<h4>Data extraction</h4>All of the manuscripts were analyzed to identify the clinical outcome, age, hand dominance, site of injection, substance injected, injection pressure, elapsed time to wide debridement, use of steroids, and incidence of infection. These variables were subjected to a Pearson chi test to determine their impact upon the need for amputation.<h4>Results</h4>Four hundred thirty-five cases of high-pressure injection injury to the upper extremity were identified. The amputation rate after these injuries was 30%. The location of the injury and the material injected contributed significantly to the need for amputation. For injections of paint, paint thinner, gasoline, oil, or jet fuel (organic solvents), the amputation risk was lower if wide surgical debridement occurred within 6 hours of injury. Steroids did not impact the amputation rate or incidence of infection. The presence of infection did not affect the incidence of amputation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The risk of amputation after high-pressure injection injury to the upper extremity is highest with organic solvent injection into the fingers. Injections into the thumb or palm result in a much lower frequency of tissue loss. Emergent surgical debridement reduces the amputation risk after injections of organic solvents. From the available data, no conclusions could be reached regarding functional outcomes, other than amputation, after high-pressure injection injury.",

In addition, other patients diagnosed with GCA at the Departments of Internal Medicine and Rheumatology at an area hospital were included. A structured review of medical records and TAB pathology reports was performed. The presence or absence of giant cells, granuloma, fragmented internal elastic lamina, fibrosis and grade of inflammatory infiltrates were recorded.<h4>Results</h4>In 183 cases with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of GCA, 139 were biopsied after start of glucocorticoids (median treatment duration 3 days; interquartile range 2-5). Patients with a positive TAB (77 %) had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.007) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; p = 0.03) at the time of clinical diagnosis. A positive TAB tended to more common in women, but there was no difference in the proportion of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or visual symptoms. Patients biopsied before or on the same day as initial treatment where more likely than those biopsied 1-3 days after treatment start to have positive biopsy [odds ratio (OR) 2.86; 95 % CI 1.06-7.70] as well as inflammatory infiltrates (OR 3.30; 95 % CI 1.15-9.49). There was no significant difference in the proportions of a fragmented internal lamina (p = 0.86), giant cells (p = 0.10), granuloma (p = 0.19), minor inflammatory infiltrates (p = 0.47), major inflammatory infiltrates (p = 0.09), or overall positive biopsy (p = 0.17) report by treatment duration comparing: ≤ 0 days, 1-3 days, 4-6 days, 7-28 days. Among those biopsied 7-28 days after start of treatment, 80 % of TABs were positive, and histopathology features were not substantially different from those biopsied after shorter glucocorticoid treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Biopsies were more likely to be positive and have characteristic histopathologic features in patients with high CRP and ESR, and prior to start of corticosteroid treatment TABs taken 1-4 weeks after initiation of glucocorticoid treatment reveal changes consistent with GCA and therefore still yields clinically useful information for the diagnosis.",https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12891-016-1225-2

Anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 antibodies have been approved following large Phase III trials. Immune-related neurological toxicity of varying severity has been reported in the literature. The cumulative incidence of neurotoxicity among ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab is reported as <1% in published clinical trials. We aimed to identify the incidence of neurotoxicity in our institution across anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies, including the combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab. We also review the existing literature and propose an investigation and management algorithm.<h4>Methods</h4>All patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab or the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (ipi + nivo), managed at the Royal Marsden Hospital between September 2010 and December 2015, including patients on (published) clinical trials were included. Medical records for each patient were reviewed and information on neurotoxicity recorded. A systematic search strategy was performed to collate existing reports of neurological toxicity.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 413 immunotherapy treatment episodes in 352 patients were included, with median follow-up of 26.7 months. Ten cases of neurotoxicity were recorded, affecting 2.8% of patients overall, ranging from grade 1 to 4, affecting both central and peripheral nervous systems. A rate of 14% was noted with ipi + nivo. Three of five patients commenced on corticosteroids responded to these. Six patients had made a full recovery at the time of reporting. A favorable radiological response was found in 7 of the 10 cases. Unusual presentations are described in detail.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Neurological toxicity is not uncommon, and may be more frequent in patients treated with combination ipi + nivo. Patterns of presentation and response to treatment are varied. A prompt and considered approach is required to optimize outcomes in this group of patients.",

The dosage of beta fraction of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and improvement of the transvaginal ultrasound allowed an earlier diagnosis and a conservative management. Currently, the use of systemic methotrexate (MTX) proved to be a great alternative with similar success rates and completely non-invasive.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched for the most relevant articles on the use of MTX in ectopic pregnancy published between 2003 and 2013 in high-impact journals. We performed a strategic search at the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), National Institute for Health Research (NHS), International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) according to the descriptors ""pregnancy, ectopic"" and ""methotrexate"", alone or combined.<h4>Results</h4>Thus, we based this review on 32 studies that were classified following the grades of recommendation and levels of evidence proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Additionally, selected papers were used. Scientific evidence points to a growing trend in the choice of conservative treatment for ectopic pregnancies, whereas expectant management still lacks studies for definitive conclusions. Indeed, the well-established protocols which exhibit a greater number of studies are still based on the single-dose treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Considering MTX, it proved to be more effective in cases of low titers of beta-hCG and masses with a small diameter, although there is still no uniformity of these parameters. The choice largely depends on the experience of the medical team and ultimately, on the woman's reproductive desire.",

The Gene-Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a useful tool for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) with rifampicin resistance within approximately two hours by using a nucleic acid amplification technique. This study was designed to reduce the underdiagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary TB and to assess the clinical and radiological characteristics of PTB patients. This cross-sectional study included 235 participants who went to the Luyang primary health care clinic from September 2016 to June 2017. The demographic data were analyzed to investigate the association of patient gender, age group, and ethnicity by chi-square test. To assess the efficacy of the diagnostic test, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were calculated. The area under the curve for sputum for both AFB and gene-Xpert was analyzed to compare their accuracy in diagnosing TB. In this study, TB was more common in males than in females. The majority (50.71%) of the cases belonged to the 25-44-year-old age group and the Bajau ethnicity (57.74%). Out of 50 pulmonary TB cases (smear-positive with AFB staining), 49 samples were positive according to the Gene-Xpert MTB/RIF assay and was confirmed by MTB culture. However, out of 185 smear-negative presumptive cases, 21 cases were positive by Gene-Xpert MTB/RIF assay in that a sample showed drug resistance, and these results were confirmed by MTB culture, showing resistance to isoniazid. In comparison to sputum for AFB, Gene-Xpert showed more sensitivity and specificity with almost complete accuracy.

Women were examined using an extended morphogenetic ultrasound protocol that, in addition to the basic evaluation, involved a color Doppler cardiac sweep and identification of early contingent markers for major abnormalities.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of lethal and severe malformations was 1.39%. The first-trimester scan identified 40.6% of the cases detected overall and 76.3% of major structural defects. The first-trimester detection rate (DR) for major congenital heart disease (either isolated or associated with extracardiac abnormalities) was 90% and that for major central nervous system anomalies was 69.5%. In fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT), the first-trimester DR for major anomalies was 96%, and in fetuses with normal NT it was 66.7%. Most (67.1%) cases with major abnormalities presented with normal NT.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A detailed first-trimester anomaly scan using an extended protocol is an efficient screening method to detect major fetal structural abnormalities in low-risk pregnancies. It is feasible at 12 to 13 + 6 weeks with ultrasound equipment and personnel already used for routine first-trimester screening. Rate of detection of severe malformations is greater in early- than in mid-pregnancy and on postnatal evaluation.

Delirium, a dangerous untoward prognostic development, serves as a barometer of systemic injury in critical illness. The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.",https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13054-020-02882-x

The programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunosuppressive pathway is often upregulated in MCC, and advanced metastatic MCC frequently responds to PD-1 blockade. We report what we believe to be the first trial of anti-PD-1 in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable MCC.<h4>Methods</h4>In the phase I/II CheckMate 358 study of virus-associated cancer types, patients with resectable MCC received nivolumab 240 mg intravenously on days 1 and 15. Surgery was planned on day 29. Tumor regression was assessed radiographically and microscopically. Tumor MCPyV status, PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were assessed in pretreatment tumor biopsies.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-nine patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIA-IV resectable MCC received ≥ 1 nivolumab dose. Three patients (7.7%) did not undergo surgery because of tumor progression (n = 1) or adverse events (n = 2). Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18 patients (46.2%), and grade 3-4 events in 3 patients (7.7%), with no unexpected toxicities. Among 36 patients who underwent surgery, 17 (47.2%) achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR). Among 33 radiographically evaluable patients who underwent surgery, 18 (54.5%) had tumor reductions ≥ 30%. Responses were observed regardless of tumor MCPyV, PD-L1, or TMB status. At a median follow-up of 20.3 months, median recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival were not reached. RFS significantly correlated with pCR and radiographic response at the time of surgery. No patient with a pCR had tumor relapse during observation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Nivolumab administered approximately 4 weeks before surgery in MCC was generally tolerable and induced pCRs and radiographic tumor regressions in approximately one half of treated patients. These early markers of response significantly predicted improved RFS. Additional investigation of these promising findings is warranted.",

Demoralization has been associated with SB in various populations and conditions, but little is known about the effect of this construct in SB patients who attend an ED. Therefore, a more inclusive SB assessment which considers the demoralization construct could be useful in clinical practice. The main aim of this study was to assess the presence and severity of demoralization in patients visiting EDs for SB. Secondly, the maintenance of the relationship between demoralization and SB after controlling for depression and the proportion of variance which accounted for hopelessness was investigated. A cross-sectional study of patients (<i>N</i> = 199) visiting an ED for SB was performed, which examined the role of demoralization, hopelessness, and depression on suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs). Demoralization was strongly and positively correlated with SI. Demoralization was related to major depressive episodes, but it was confirmed to be a different and, probably, more sensitive construct for SB, validating its specificity in relation to depression. Hopelessness accounted for a small portion of the variance in SI, compared to demoralization. Formal support for the association of demoralization with SI was provided.

Approximately 80% of the patients are females. The characteristic syndrome evolves in several stages, with approximately 70% of the patients presenting with a prodromal phase of fever, malaise, headache, upper respiratory tract symptoms, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Next, typically within two weeks, patients develop psychiatric symptoms including insomnia, delusions, hyperreligiosity, paranoia, hallucinations, apathy and depression. Catatonic symptoms, seizures, abnormal movements, autonomic instability, memory deficits may also develop during the course of the disease. Presence of antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR in the CSF and serum confirm the diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis, which also should prompt a thorough search for an underlying tumor. Age, gender, and ethnicity may all play a role, as black females older than 18 years of age have an increased likelihood of an underlying tumor. Treatment is focused on tumor resection and first-line immunotherapy [corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin]. In non-responders, second- line immunotherapy [rituximab or cyclophosphamide or combined] is required. More than 75% of the patients recover completely or have mild sequelae, while the remaining patients end up demonstrating persistent severe disability or death. There is a paucity of literature on the management of psychiatric symptoms in this population. Given the neuropsychiatric symptoms in the relatively early phase of the illness, approximately 77 % of the patients are first evaluated by a psychiatrist. Earlier recognition of this illness is of paramount importance as prompt diagnosis and treatment can potentially improve prognosis. We describe two patients diagnosed with NMDAR encephalitis presenting with two different psychiatric manifestations. The first patient presented with psychotic mania and catatonic symptoms, while the second suffered from depression with psychotic and catatonic features refractory to psychotropic medications. We review of the use of psychotropic medications and ECT to address insomnia, agitation, psychosis, mood dysregulation and catatonia in NMDAR encephalitis.",

The patients' medical history, age, and good bone quality suggested ONFH as a possible underlying cause of the fractures. If we had not suspected ONFH as a predisposing condition, these minimally displaced fractures might have been fixed internally with multiple pins, and this would have led to nonunion or collapse of the femoral head. To avoid inappropriate treatment, ONFH should be considered as a predisposing factor in pathological fractures of the femoral neck.",

Whether COVID-19 vaccination may be linked to the occurrence of myocarditis is unknown.<h4>Objective</h4>To describe a group of 7 patients with acute myocarditis over 3 months, 4 of whom had recent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>All patients referred for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging at Duke University Medical Center were asked to participate in a prospective outcomes registry. Two searches of the registry database were performed: first, to identify patients with acute myocarditis for the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30 for 2017 through 2021, and second, to identify all patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis for the past 20 years. Once patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis were identified, data available in the registry were supplemented by additional data collection from the electronic health record and a telephone interview.<h4>Exposures</h4>mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Occurrence of acute myocarditis by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.<h4>Results</h4>In the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30, 2021, 7 patients with acute myocarditis were identified, of which 4 occurred within 5 days of COVID-19 vaccination. Three were younger male individuals (age, 23-36 years) and 1 was a 70-year-old female individual. All 4 had received the second dose of an mRNA vaccine (2 received mRNA-1273 [Moderna], and 2 received BNT162b2 [Pfizer]).

Alzheimer's-related neuropathological changes are commonly found in the brains of older people. Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported to be a potential predictor for suicidal behavior, the relationship between suicidal behavior and AD has not been systematically explored. The aim of this paper is to review the current literature regarding the association between suicide risk and AD in an effort to identify the most relevant risk and protective factors for suicide. A detailed strategy was used to search for relevant articles in Pubmed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Science Direct on suicidal behavior and AD for the period of January 1980 to August 2015. The search yielded 164 articles, of which 21 met our inclusion criteria. Eight crosssectional, two longitudinal, 3 retrospective, and eight case reports (of 11 patients) examined the association between suicide risk and AD. Suicide occurs in AD even many years after the diagnosis of dementia, and patients who have attempted suicide once are at a higher risk of dying from suicide. AD is associated with a moderate risk of suicide, and clinicians working with AD patients should undertake an appropriate assessment of their suicidal risk. However, more prospective studies are needed to clarify the association between AD and suicide risk.",

SAPHO syndrome is rare, although probably underrecognized because its diagnosis may be challenging because of the wide variability in its musculoskeletal and cutaneous manifestations. This is especially true when atypical sites are involved and when specific skin lesions are absent. There are no standardized treatment protocols available. Current treatments are empirical and have the objective of providing relief from the at times debilitating pain associated with SAPHO syndrome. They include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics as first-line agents. Systemic corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, biologicals targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1, and bisphosphonates have all been beneficial in some patients, but ineffective in others. This suggests that the pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome is multifactorial, but this aspect remains poorly explored, although bacteria and immunological dysfunction are hypothesized to play a role.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The early recognition, diagnosis, and prompt treatment of SAPHO syndrome can prevent the unnecessary use of long-term antibiotics or invasive procedures, while rapidly alleviating pain in a majority of affected patients.",

Data were extracted from our outpatient registry. Assessment included a full physical examination, grip strength, range of motion, two-point discrimination and Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire. We followed 8 male patients for an average of 12.7 years. Their average age was 37 at time of injury and all had injured their right dominant hand. Seventy-five percent of the injuries were to the index finger. Seven out of the 8 patients returned to their pre-injury occupation, 4 out of 8 patients had reduced range of motion of the affected digit. Injury sequelae adversely affected activities of daily living (ADL) with an average QuickDASH score of 26. Grip strength in the injured hand was reduced by an average of 35% in 6 out of 8 patients compared with the uninjured hand. Sensation was also reduced in the affected digit in 7 out of 8 patients. All patients suffered from some level of neuropathic pain and/or cold intolerance. High pressure injection injury to the fingers is a serious event found amongst industrial laborers.

The Philippines was thought to be free of yaws following the 1950s eradication campaign but it has been reported in the Liguasan Marsh area, Central Mindanao. This is the first documentation of yaws cases in the Philippines since the 1970s. We describe active and latent yaws recently detected in the Southern Philippines.<h4>Case presentation</h4>Cross-sectional surveys and screening of skin diseases were conducted in one randomly selected public elementary school per selected municipality in Liguasan Marsh, covering three municipalities per province. Yaws suspects underwent screening and confirmatory serologic tests for Treponema pallidum using Dual Path Platform Syphilis Screen and Confirm Assay (DPP) and Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination (TPPA). Children with yaws skin lesions and reactive confirmatory tests for T. pallidum and non-treponemal antibodies were considered confirmed yaws cases. Four children aged 5-10 years old had confirmed secondary yaws in Tulunan Municipality, Cotabato Province and in Lambayong Municipality, Sultan Kudarat Province. All had secondary yaws lesions such as moist, cauliflower-like papillomas, thick yellow crusts on pink papules and nodules, whitish, papulosquamous papules and plaques, or hypopigmented patches with small papules on the periphery. Yaws papillomas and erosions were also found on the soles of the feet of one child. The index case had a skin punch biopsy of a partially treated papilloma on his axilla. Histopathological findings showed lichenoid psoriasiform dermatitis with plasma cells, consistent with yaws.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The clinical, serological, and histopathological confirmation of four yaws cases among children has made the Philippines the 14th country endemic for yaws. This report can help health personnel recognize hidden cases of yaws based on skin signs and serological tests. Yaws remained unrecognized and unreported in the Philippines and in countries previously endemic for yaws probably due to the unsustained integration of the yaws program in the general health services and complacency after the 1950s eradication campaign. Our findings have provided the necessary evidence and stimulus to develop a yaws control and eradication program as one of the country's neglected tropical diseases.",https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40249-019-0617-6.pdf

The tumor, which arose in the pancreas head, was removed on pancreaticoduodenectomy. The patient died, however, of disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome from postoperative sepsis 13 days later. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of malignant epithelial (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells) and mesenchymal (spindle-shaped tumor cells) components. The adenocarcinoma cells had positive immunostaining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 7, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CEA and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), while focal staining of these proteins was observed in the sarcomatous cells. In contrast, the sarcomatous cells had diffuse immunostaining for vimentin, CD10 and p53, while these proteins were not expressed in the ductal adenocarcinoma cells. These findings support the dual characteristics of a carcinosarcoma. DNA sequencing of the present case indicated point mutations of K-ras in both codons 12 and 34 on exon 2. The latter mutation is likely to correlate with the sarcomatous characteristics of this tumor. The tumor cells had specific and diffuse positive staining for CD10 and p53, with features characteristic of rapid growth.",

In five patients the aneurysms were large, but only one of these had ruptured; four of these patients had symptoms of mass lesions. The remaining nine patients were operated on for a ruptured aneurysm; seven had subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm and two had bleeding from another aneurysm in the presence of an asymptomatic carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm. All patients were treated by a combined epi- and subdural direct surgical approach, which excluded the carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm from the circulation and made possible the preservation of the adjacent structures. Two patients died: one a few hours after surgery from a massive thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery and another 2 months after surgery as a result of gastrointestinal bleeding. All the other patients showed postoperative improvement in symptoms and signs. This report focuses on a modified direct surgical approach involving exposure of the internal carotid artery proximal to the lesion, and of the ophthalmic artery, which is of primary importance in securing safe and complete occlusion of a carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm. Removal of individual bone structures at the base of the skull provides a better and safer exposure of the central segment of the internal carotid artery than does excessive and hazardous retraction of the brain.",

Of 536 articles, 48, reporting on 62 patients, met the inclusion criteria. MRI was positive in 92.1% of the cases and it normalized after clinical resolution. There was no evidence of which steroid schedule should be considered as adequate; high-dose steroids are likely to be more effective both to induce resolution and to avoid recurrences. Pain subsided within the time limit required by the ICHD-II criteria, but signs did not. We conclude that THS diagnostic criteria can be improved on the basis of currently available data.

Therefore, further descriptions of the pathological processes in those animals that show symptoms similar to those described in humans affected by COVID-19 would be highly valuable. The potential for companion animals to contribute to the continued transmission and community spread of this known human-to-human disease is an urgent issue to be considered. Forty animals with pulmonary pathologies were studied by chest X-ray, ultrasound analysis, and computed tomography. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. An additional twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2-positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by several immunoassays was performed. Our findings show that sick dogs presented severe alveolar or interstitial patterns with pulmonary opacity, parenchymal abnormalities, and bilateral lesions. The forty sick dogs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 26 of 33 dogs. Five healthy and one pathological dog presented IgG against SARS-CoV-2.

We analyzed 21 cases of intraosseous lipoma at a single institution for clinical and radiographic characteristics.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study was performed on 21 pathologically confirmed intraosseous lipomas treated in our hospital from 2000 to 2017. Simple X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging findings and medical records were reviewed. Patients' age, sex, and clinical symptoms were investigated. From the radiographic images, the site of the lesion, calcification, bony expansion, and stage of the lesion were evaluated. Correlations between the degree of involution and clinical symptoms were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>The mean age of patients was 50 years (range, 20 to 67 years), and there were 13 males and eight females. The mean lesion size was 6.1 cm (range, 2.5 to 13.6 cm). The most common anatomical site of the lesion was the femur (seven cases), and three cases occurred in flat bones such as the ilium and scapula. Visual analogue scale score for pain was 3 to 6 in 15 patients. There were no complaints of functional limitation. There was no correlation between the degree of degeneration and clinical symptoms (<i>p</i> = 1.000). Curettage was performed as a surgical treatment in 20 patients, and bone graft was performed using a bone chip. Excision was performed in one patient. Pain was resolved in seven of 11 patients with a complaint of preoperative pain; intermittent pain remained in four cases. There was no local recurrence or malignant change during the follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There was no correlation between the degree of degeneration and clinical symptoms. Pain was the most common clinical symptom, but it was rarely accompanied by functional limitation. However, it is important to distinguish it from other pain-inducing disorders. The incidence of intraosseous lipomas is low, and detection based on various imaging findings can be difficult.

The fund of knowledge regarding etiology, presentation and clinical outcomes remains limited. Evaluation of genetic disorders associated with the development of adrenocortical disorders has allowed researchers to identify a number of mutations that may be involved in tumorigenesis, including alterations in the GNAS1, PRKAR1A, TP53 and IGF2 genes. Clinical presentation in children is associated most commonly with young age, female gender and symptoms of virilization. Most children have localized disease at presentation which may be associated with a better prognosis when compared to adults. Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment and mitotane, the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agent, has a poor response rate and is highly toxic. Broader participation in multi-center research, such as the International Pediatric Adrenocortical Tumor Registry, is needed to collect sufficient data to better guide our clinical management.",

However, the diagnosis of SS with neurologic involvement is sometimes difficult, and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations have been described rarely. We conducted the current study to describe the clinical and laboratory features of SS patients with neurologic manifestations and to report their clinical outcome. We retrospectively studied 82 patients (65 women and 17 men) with neurologic manifestations associated with primary SS, as defined by the 2002 American-European criteria. The mean age at neurologic onset was 53 years. Neurologic involvement frequently preceded the diagnosis of SS (81% of patients). Fifty-six patients had CNS disorders, which were mostly focal or multifocal. Twenty-nine patients had spinal cord involvement (acute myelopathy [n = 12], chronic myelopathy [n = 16], or motor neuron disease [n = 1]). Thirty-three patients had brain involvement and 13 patients had optic neuropathy. The disease mimicked relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in 10 patients and primary progressive MS in 13 patients. We also recorded diffuse CNS symptoms: some of the patients presented seizures (n = 7), cognitive dysfunction (n = 9), and encephalopathy (n = 2). Fifty-one patients had peripheral nervous system involvement (PNS). Symmetric axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with a predominance of sensory symptoms or pure sensory neuropathy occurred most frequently (n = 28), followed by cranial nerve involvement affecting trigeminal, facial, or cochlear nerves (n = 16). Multiple mononeuropathy (n = 7), myositis (n = 2), and polyradiculoneuropathy (n = 1) were also observed. Thirty percent of patients (all with CNS involvement) had oligoclonal bands. Visual evoked potentials were abnormal in 61% of the patients tested. Fifty-eight patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Of these, 70% presented white matter lesions and 40% met the radiologic criteria for MS. Thirty-nine patients had a spinal cord MRI. Abnormalities were observed only in patients with spinal cord involvement. Among the 29 patients with myelopathy, 75% had T2-weighted hyperintensities. Patients with PNS manifestations had frequent extraglandular complications of SS. Anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB antibodies were detected in 21% of patients at the diagnosis of SS and in 43% of patients during the follow-up (mean follow-up, 10 yr). Biologic abnormalities were more frequently observed in patients with PNS involvement than in those with CNS involvement (p < 0.01). Fifty-two percent of patients had severe disability, and were more likely to have CNS involvement than PNS involvement (p < 0.001). Treatment by cyclophosphamide allowed a partial recovery or stabilization in patients with myelopathy (92%) or multiple mononeuropathy (100%). The current study underlines the diversity of neurologic complications of SS. The frequency of neurologic manifestations revealing SS and of negative biologic features, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why SS is frequently misdiagnosed. Screening for SS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, or cranial nerve involvement. The outcome is frequently severe, especially in patients with CNS involvement. Our study also underlines the efficacy of cyclophosphamide in myelopathy and multiple neuropathy occurring during SS.",

Advances in autoimmune encephalitis research in the past 10 years have led to the identification of new syndromes and biomarkers that have transformed the diagnostic approach to these disorders. However, existing criteria for autoimmune encephalitis are too reliant on antibody testing and response to immunotherapy, which might delay the diagnosis. We reviewed the literature and gathered the experience of a team of experts with the aims of developing a practical, syndrome-based diagnostic approach to autoimmune encephalitis and providing guidelines to navigate through the differential diagnosis. Because autoantibody test results and response to therapy are not available at disease onset, we based the initial diagnostic approach on neurological assessment and conventional tests that are accessible to most clinicians. Through logical differential diagnosis, levels of evidence for autoimmune encephalitis (possible, probable, or definite) are achieved, which can lead to prompt immunotherapy.",

Because prostaglandins (PG) are autocrine regulators in many tissues, we determined whether they have this role in gonadotropes. We first demonstrated that GnRH stimulates PG synthesis by induction of cyclooxygenase-2, via the protein kinase C/c-Src/phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/MAPK pathway in the LbetaT2 gonadotrope cell line. We then demonstrated that PGF(2alpha) and PGI2, but not PGE2 inhibited GnRH receptor expression by inhibition of phosphoinositide turnover. PGF(2alpha), but not PGI2 or PGE2, reduced GnRH-induction of LHbeta gene expression, but not the alpha-gonadotropin subunit or the FSHbeta subunit genes. The prostanoid receptors EP1, EP2, FP, and IP were expressed in rat gonadotropes. Incubations of rat pituitaries with PGF(2alpha), but not PGI2 or PGE2, inhibited GnRH-induced LH secretion, whereas the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, stimulated GnRH-induced LH secretion. None of these treatments had any effect on GnRH-induced FSH secretion. The findings have thus elaborated a novel GnRH signaling pathway mediated by PGF(2alpha)-FP and PGI2-IP, which acts through an autocrine/paracrine modality to limit autoregulation of the GnRH receptor and differentially inhibit LH and FSH release. These findings provide a mechanism for asynchronous LH and FSH secretions and suggest the use of combination therapies of GnRH and prostanoid analogs to treat infertility, diseases with unbalanced LH and FSH secretion and in hormone-dependent diseases such as prostatic cancer.",

Both 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR recognized cell culture passaged isolates of 10 bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV), 5 calf diarrhea (CD) and 8 winter dysentery (WD) strains of BCV, but not transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus or bovine rotavirus. The sensitivity of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR was compared to that of an antigen-capture ELISA. The lowest detection limit of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR as determined by using tenfold serial dilutions of the BRCV 255 and 440 strains in BCV negative nasal swab suspensions from preexposure gnotobiotic calves was 2 x 10(4) and 2 x 10(2) TCID50/0.1 ml for each strain, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the antigen-capture ELISA as determined by using the same serially diluted samples was 1 x 10(6) TCID50/0.1 ml for each strain. Therefore, the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were 50 and 5000 times, respectively more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA to detect BRCV in nasal swab suspensions. To investigate in vivo cross-protection between the BRCV and CD or WD strains of BCV and to detect nasal and fecal shedding of BCV using the 1-step RT-PCR, nested PCR and antigen-capture ELISA, 6 colostrum-deprived and two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with a BRCV, a CD or a WD strain of BCV and then challenged 3-4 weeks later with either BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV. All calves developed diarrhea after inoculation and BCV antigen (ELISA) or RNA (RT-PCR) was detected in the diarrheic fecal samples or the corresponding nasal swab samples. In addition, low amounts of BCV were also detected only by nested PCR in the fecal and nasal swab samples before and after diarrhea. No respiratory clinical signs were observed during the entire experimental period, but elevated rectal temperatures were detected during diarrhea in the BCV-inoculated calves. All calves recovered from infection with the BRCV, CD, or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either a heterologous or homologous strain of BCV. However, all calves challenged with heterologous BCV strains showed subclinical BCV infection evident by detection of nasal and fecal shedding of BCV RNA detected only by nested PCR. Such results confirm field and experimental data documenting reinfection of the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory or enteric tract reinfections may constitute a source of BCV transmissible to cows (WD) or neonatal or feedlot calves. In addition, the present 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were highly sensitive to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal specimens. Therefore, these assays should be useful to diagnose BCV infections in calves and adult cows.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7087283?pdf=render

In pediatric patients with ATD, thrombosis typically develops during the neonatal period or adolescence. However, to date there are no consistent recommendations on the therapeutic management of children with ATD. Inferior vena cava atresia (IVCA) belongs to a range of congenital or acquired vena cava malformations and is described as an independent risk factor for thrombosis. The present case report explores two cases of combined ATD and IVCA in an adolescent and his mother.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 14-year-old male presented with extensive deep venous thromboses (DVTs) of both lower extremities as well as an IVCA. The patient had previously been diagnosed with an asymptomatic ATD without therapeutic consequences at that time. His mother was suffering from an ATD and had herself just been diagnosed with IVCA, too. The DVTs in the adolescent were treated by systemic anticoagulation and catheter-directed local thrombolysis causing favourable results. Yet, despite adequate oral anticoagulation the DVTs in both lower extremities reoccurred within 1 week after the patient was discharged from hospital. This time, thrombolysis could not be fully achieved. Surprisingly, probing and stenting of the IVCA was achieved, indicating an acquired IVCA which could have occurred after undetected thrombosis in early childhood. Genetic analyses showed the same mutation causing ATD in both son and mother: heterozygote missense mutation c.248 T > C, p.(Leu83Pro), within the heparin binding domain of antithrombin. This mutation was never reported in mutation databases before.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge this is the first case report discussing combined ATD and IVCA in two family members. Since ATDs present with clinical heterogeneity, taking a thorough family history is crucial for the anticipation of possible complications in affected children and decisions on targeted diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. Affected families must be educated on risk factors and clinical signs of thrombosis and need an immediate diagnostic workup in case of clinical symptoms. IVCA in patients with ATD could occur due to thrombotic occlusion at a very early age. Therefore, in case of family members with IVCA and ATD ultrasound screening in newborns should be considered.",https://thrombosisjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12959-021-00360-0

Eighteen patients had died. The results of this investigation suggest that: (1) The severity of the disease at its onset does not determine the survival; (2) Females survived longer; (3) Young age of the patients at the onset of IPH seems to carry a less favorable prognosis; (4) The common therapeutic modalities in use have not proved to be beneficial.

Here we compare and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of those two groups of targeted anti-inflammatory therapeutics.<h4>Discussion</h4>TNF-blocking biologic agents were introduced into the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in the late 1990s. Further biologic agents targeting cytokine networks or specific lymphocyte subsets have since been added to the armamentarium of anti-rheumatic therapy. During the last few years, another wave of novel discoveries led to the development of a new class of small molecule anti-inflammatory compounds targeting intracellular signal transduction molecules, such as tyrosine kinases. In all those cases, the specific targets of the drugs are well defined and significant knowledge about their role in the disease pathomechanism is available, qualifying them for being targeted therapeutics for inflammatory rheumatic diseases. While both groups of targeted therapeutics offer significant clinical benefit, they clearly differ in several aspects, such as the localization of their targets, their route of administration and target specificity, as well as technical details such as manufacturing procedures and cost basis. In this debate paper, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two different approaches, aiming to shed light on the possible future of targeted therapies.<h4>Summary</h4>Biologic therapeutics and small-molecule inhibitors both have significant advantages and disadvantages in the therapy of rheumatic diseases. The future of targeted therapies is one of the most exciting questions of current rheumatology research and therapy.",https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1741-7015-12-43

Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) overcomes the innate dilemma of very limited genetic material available for PGT-M. <b>Objective</b>: To evaluate the use of MDA, combined with haplotype analysis and mutation amplification, in PGT-M for families with SMA. <b>Methods</b>: MDA was used to amplify the whole genome from single blastomeres or trophectoderm (TE) cells. Exon 7 of the survival motor neuron gene 1 (SMN1) and eleven STRs markers flanking the SMN1 gene were incorporated into singleplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on MDA products. <b>Results</b>: Sixteen cycles (19 ovum pick-up cycles) of PGT-M were initiated in 12 couples. A total of 141 embryos were tested: 90 embryos were biopsied at the cleavage stage and 51 embryos were biopsied at the blastocyst stage. MDA was successful on 94.44% (85/90) of the single blastomeres and on 92.16% (47/51) of the TE cells. And the PCR efficiency were 98.4% (561/570) and 100% (182/182), respectively. In addition, the average allele drop-out (ADO) rates were 13.3% (60/392) and 9.8% (11/112), respectively. The results for SMN1 exon 7 were all matched with haplotype analysis, which allowed an accurate diagnosis of 93.62% (132/141) embryos. Twelve families had unaffected embryos available for transfer and a total of 38 embryos were transferred in 20 embryo transfer cycles. Eight transfers were successful, resulting in a clinical pregnancy rate of 40% (8/20) and an implantation rate of 28.95% (11/38). Finally, 11 healthy babies were born. Among them, 5 SMA carriers were singleton live births and 3 SMA carriers had twin births. <b>Conclusion</b>: Careful handling during the MDA procedure can improve subsequent PCR efficiency and reduce the ADO rate. We suggest that this protocol is reliable for increasing the accuracy of the PGT-M for SMA.",https://www.medsci.org/v16p1313.pdf

Due to the limited number of donor organs, extracorporeal liver support is suggested as an appealing concept to ""bridge to transplant"" or to avoid transplant in case of recovery. ADVanced Organ Support (ADVOS) is a new type of albumin dialysis, that provides rapid regeneration of toxin-binding albumin by two purification circuits altering the binding capacities of albumin by biochemical (changing of pH) and physical (changing of temperature) modulation of the dialysate. It was the aim of this study to evaluate feasibility, efficacy and safety of ADVOS in the first 14 patients ever treated with this procedure.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients included suffered from acute on chronic LF (n = 9) or ""secondary"" LF (n = 5) which resulted from non-hepatic diseases such as sepsis. The primary endpoint was the change of serum bilirubin, creatinine and serum BUN levels before and after the first treatment with ADVOS. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for paired samples was used to analyze the data.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 239 treatments (1 up to 101 per patient) were performed in 14 patients (6 female, 8 male). Mean age 54 ± 13; MELD-score 34 ± 7; CLIF-SOFA 15 ± 3. Serum bilirubin levels were significantly decreased by 32% during the first session (26.0 ± 15.4 vs. 17.7 ± 10.5 mg/dl; p = 0.001). Similarly, serum creatinine (2.2 ± 0.8 vs. 1.6 ± 0.7 mg/dl; p = 0.005) and serum BUN (49.4 ± 23.3 vs. 31.1 ± 19.7 mg/dl; p = 0.003), were significantly lowered by 27% and 37%, respectively. None of the treatment sessions had to be interrupted due to side effects related to the procedure.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ADVOS efficiently eliminates water- and protein-bound toxins in humans with LF. ADVOS is feasible in patients with advanced LF which is emphasized by a total number of more than 100 treatment sessions in one single patient.",https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12876-017-0569-x

Thus, we report here a prospective study in three herds of crossbred beef calves (n = 817) with endemic BCV. Serial blood samples for measurement of serum anti-BCV antibody titers and nasal swabs for detection of BCV and other common viral and bacterial BRD pathogens were collected from all calves or subsets of calves at predetermined times from birth through weaning. The calves were monitored for BRD and those that developed signs of respiratory disease were sampled for diagnostic testing. To discover additional risk factors that could have influenced BRD development, sequence analysis of the BCV strain(s) circulating in each herd, and the prevalence of common opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of sick and apparently healthy cattle were also evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred forty-eight of the 817 study calves (30.4%) were treated for BRD prior to weaning; 246 of those were from a single herd involved in two outbreaks of BRD leading to mass treatment of all calves in that group. Molecular diagnostic testing found BCV and Histophilus somni in nasal swabs taken at the time of BRD treatment. Between herd analyses revealed anti-BCV serum antibody abundance did not associate with the incidence of BRD or BCV shedding, though these measurements may have been hindered by the long periods between sample collections. Analysis of the BCV spike gene hypervariable region revealed four polymorphisms in 15 isolates from the three herds, making strain variation unlikely to account for differences in treatment rates between herds. Persistent or recurrent shedding episodes of BCV occurred in some animals treated for BRD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Co-detection of BCV and H. somni at the time of the disease outbreak suggests that these pathogens contributed to disease pathogenesis. Developing appropriate control measures for respiratory BCV infections may help decrease the incidence of pre-weaning BRD. The role of antibodies in protection must still be further defined.",https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12917-019-1887-8

SARS-CoV-2 infections of feline and canine species have also been reported. However, it is not entirely clear to what extent natural SARS-CoV-2 infection of pet dogs and cats is in households. We have developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neutralization assay to screen serum samples of 239 pet cats and 510 pet dogs in Minnesota in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-April to early June 2020 for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposures. A cutoff value was used to identify the seropositive samples in each experiment. The average seroprevalence of N- and RBD-specific antibodies in pet cats were 8% and 3%, respectively. Among nineteen (19) N-seropositive cat sera, fifteen (15) exhibited neutralizing activity and seven (7) were also RBD-seropositive. The N-based ELISA is also specific and does not cross react with antigens of common feline coronaviruses. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected at a very low percentage in pet dogs (~ 1%) and were limited to IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N protein with no neutralizing activities. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 seropositive rates are higher in pet cats than in pet dogs in MN early in the pandemic and that SARS-CoV-2 N-specific IgG antibodies can detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in companion animals with higher levels of specificity and sensitivity than RBD-specific IgG antibodies in ELISA-based assays.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8205054?pdf=render

A case following osteonecrosis of the femoral head is quite rare; even more uncommon is its occurrence in the bilateral hips. Magnetic resonance imaging has been established as the preferred tool for diagnosing nondisplaced femoral neck stress fracture due to overuse injury. Magnetic resonance imaging was also useful to detect the initial lesion even in this case, although the etiology was different between overuse injury and insufficiency fracture.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 41-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with bilateral early stage idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head was observed non-weight-bearing as much as possible using a stick. However, her pain and difficulty in walking progressed. Bilateral femoral neck stress fractures were subsequently detected by magnetic resonance imaging. The fracture initially appeared as a spot of bone marrow edema at the medial site of the femoral neck, and then developed into a fracture line. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the preparatory reaming served as core decompression of the femoral heads, as well as being treatment for osteonecrosis. Her bone mineral density and 25-hydroxy vitamin D values were low for her age. We administered eldecalcitol and teriparatide acetate. Her symptoms mostly improved, and the fracture lines and necrotic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging reduced at 5 months after the surgery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Bilateral femoral neck stress fractures are a very rare condition and are often missed. It is important to listen to the patient's complaints and perform an appropriate examination. We encountered a case of bilateral femoral neck stress fracture that occurred in a patient with early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and were able to observe progression of stress fracture since before fracture occurred.

In this report, we demonstrate that the products of mutant alleles that impair DNA recognition can antagonize WT1-mediated transcriptional repression. We demonstrate that WT1 can self-associate in vitro and in vivo and that the responsible domain maps to the amino-terminal region of the protein. Oligomers of full-length protein form less efficiently or produce less stable complexes than oligomers between truncated polypeptides and full-length protein.

Acute artery of Percheron infarcts represent 0.1 to 2% of total ischemic stroke. However, of thalamic strokes, occlusion of artery of Percheron is the cause in 4 to 35% of cases. Early diagnosis of artery of Percheron infarction can be challenging because it is infrequent and early computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be negative. Thus, it can be confused with other neurological conditions such as tumors and infections.<h4>Case presentation</h4>This is a retrospective case study of a 56-year-old white man admitted to Umeå University Hospital and diagnosed with an artery of Percheron infarction. Medical records and the neuroradiological database were reviewed, and the diagnosis was made based on typical symptoms and radiological findings of artery of Percheron infarction. We report the case of a 56-year-old man with a history of overconsumption of alcohol who was found in his home unconscious and hypothermic. He had a Reaction Level Scale-85 score of 4. He developed ventricular fibrillation on arrival at our emergency department, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation successfully restored sinus rhythm within an estimated 2 minutes of onset. He was then put on cardiopulmonary bypass for rewarming. The initial head computed tomography performed on admission was wrongly assessed as unremarkable. Bilateral ischemia in the paramedian thalamic nuclei and pons were first documented on a follow-up computed tomography on day 24 after hospitalization. He died on day 35 after hospitalization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Artery of Percheron infarcts are rare. The radiological diagnosis can initially often be judged as normal and in combination with variability in the neurological symptoms it is a rather difficult condition to diagnose. For these reasons few clinicians have much experience with this type of infarct, which may delay diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment.",https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13256-017-1375-3

Patients present with normal female external genitalia, streak gonads and XY karyotype and frequently develop gonadoblastoma. Glomerular symptoms consist of childhood proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, characterized by unspecific focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis, progressing to end-stage renal failure in adolescence or early adulthood. No case of Wilms' tumour has been reported, even in patients with extended follow-up. In contrast with FS patients, most individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS; refs 6,7) have ambiguous genitalia or a female phenotype, an XY karyotype and dysgenetic gonads. Renal symptoms are characterized by diffuse mesangial sclerosis, usually before the age of one year, and patients frequently develop Wilms' tumour. Mutations of the Wilms'-tumour gene, WT1, cause different pathologies of the urogenital system, including DDS. WT1 is composed of ten exons and encodes a protein with four zinc-finger motifs and transcriptional and tumour-suppressor activities. Alternative splicing generates four isoforms: the fifth exon may or may not be present, and an alternative splice site in intron 9 allows the addition of three amino acids (KTS) between the third and fourth zinc fingers of WT1 (ref. 17). Here we demonstrate that FS is caused by mutations in the donor splice site in intron 9 of WT1, with the predicted loss of the +KTS isoform.

The sudden enlargement of the pituitary mass undergoing PA is responsible for a wide range of acute symptoms/signs (severe headache, visual loss, diplopia, hypopituitarism, impaired consciousness) which, together with the radiological evidence of a pituitary lesion, establish the diagnosis. The optimal care of PA requires involvement of a multidisciplinary team including endocrinologist, neurosurgeon, neuroophthalmologist and the management strategy that depends on the clinical manifestations, as well as the presence of co-morbidities. Prompt surgical decompression is initially indicated in cases with severe or progressive impairment of the visual acuity or the visual fields or with altered mental state and leads to visual and neurological recovery in most of the patients. The patients with mild, stable clinical picture (including those with isolated ocular palsies) can be managed conservatively (support of fluid and electrolyte balance and stress doses of steroids in most cases) with favourable visual and neurological outcome. Frequent reassessment is mandatory because the clinical course can be unpredictable; if progression of symptoms occurs, later elective surgery is indicated and is beneficial, especially in terms of visual outcome. The endocrinological outcome is less favourable, irrespective of the treatment option, with many patients remaining on long-term replacement therapy.

The patient responded excellently to sodium correction and pulse methylprednisolone therapy and was erroneously diagnosed as idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination. One year later, she presented with vague constitutional symptoms, renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal), hypokalemia with associated myopathy. Subsequent testing for anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A (SSA)/Ro autoantibodies and a biopsy of the minor salivary gland established the diagnosis of primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS). Remission was achieved with oral prednisolone after her discharge. Neurological signs can be the initial presentation that precedes the classical systemic manifestations of multisystem autoimmune disorders like pSS. In the event of osmotic demyelination, when antecedent hyponatremia with rapid correction is not there, we suggest evaluating for possible autoimmune etiology.",https://www.cureus.com/articles/76738-rare-case-of-central-pontine-myelinolysis-etiological-dilemma.pdf

Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 ± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6% (5/138)-15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)-66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. In 36% (5/14)-53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)-82% (54/66) patients for 1-11 days.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China. SARS-CoV-2 enters gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and the faeces of COVID-19 patients are potentially infectious.",

For the first time, the WHO classification of CNS tumors uses molecular parameters in addition to histology to define many tumor entities, thus formulating a concept for how CNS tumor diagnoses should be structured in the molecular era. As such, the 2016 CNS WHO presents major restructuring of the diffuse gliomas, medulloblastomas and other embryonal tumors, and incorporates new entities that are defined by both histology and molecular features, including glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype and glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant; RELA fusion-positive ependymoma; medulloblastoma, WNT-activated and medulloblastoma, SHH-activated; and embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes, C19MC-altered. The 2016 edition has added newly recognized neoplasms, and has deleted some entities, variants and patterns that no longer have diagnostic and/or biological relevance. Other notable changes include the addition of brain invasion as a criterion for atypical meningioma and the introduction of a soft tissue-type grading system for the now combined entity of solitary fibrous tumor / hemangiopericytoma-a departure from the manner by which other CNS tumors are graded. Overall, it is hoped that the 2016 CNS WHO will facilitate clinical, experimental and epidemiological studies that will lead to improvements in the lives of patients with brain tumors.",

Although previous research has reported an increased risk of skin cancer in solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs), no study has estimated the posttransplant population-based incidence in the United States.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the incidence and evaluate the risk factors for posttransplant skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma (MM), and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in a cohort of US OTRs receiving a primary organ transplant in 2003 or 2008.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This multicenter retrospective cohort study examined 10 649 adult recipients of a primary transplant performed at 26 centers across the United States in the Transplant Skin Cancer Network during 1 of 2 calendar years (either 2003 or 2008) identified through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) database. Recipients of all organs except intestine were included, and the follow-up periods were 5 and 10 years.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Incident skin cancer was determined through detailed medical record review. Data on predictors were obtained from the OPTN database. The incidence rates for posttransplant skin cancer overall and for SCC, MM, and MCC were calculated per 100 000 person-years. Potential risk factors for posttransplant skin cancer were tested using multivariate Cox regression analysis to yield adjusted hazard ratios (HR).<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 10 649 organ transplant recipients (mean [SD] age, 51 [12] years; 3873 women [36%] and 6776 men [64%]) contributed 59 923 years of follow-up. The incidence rates for posttransplant skin cancer was 1437 per 100 000 person-years. Specific subtype rates for SCC, MM, and MCC were 812, 75, and 2 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. Statistically significant risk factors for posttransplant skin cancer included pretransplant skin cancer (HR, 4.69; 95% CI, 3.26-6.73), male sex (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.34-1.81), white race (HR, 9.04; 95% CI, 6.20-13.18), age at transplant 50 years or older (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.20-3.48), and being transplanted in 2008 vs 2003 (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.94).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Posttransplant skin cancer is common, with elevated risk imparted by increased age, white race, male sex, and thoracic organ transplantation. A temporal cohort effect was present. Understanding the risk factors and trends in posttransplant skin cancer is fundamental to targeted screening and prevention in this population.",

Traditionally, during these procedures the catheters are guided by fluoroscopy, which poses a risk to the patient and staff by ionizing radiation. Our aim was to describe our experience in the implementation of an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) guided zero fluoroscopic (ZF) ablation approach to our routine clinical practice.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a simplified ICE guided technique to perform ablation procedures for AF, with the aid of a 3D electroanatomical mapping system. The workflow was implemented in two phases: (1) the Introductory phase, where the first 16 ZF PVIs were compared with 16 cases performed with fluoroscopy and (2) the Extension phase, where 71 consecutive patients (including repeat procedures) with ZF approach were included. Standard PVI (and redoPVI) procedures were performed, data on feasibility of the ZF approach, complications, acute and 1-year success rates were collected.<h4>Results</h4>In the Introductory phase, 94% of the procedures could be performed with complete ZF with a median procedure time of 77.5 (73.5-83) minutes. In one case fluoroscopy was used to guide the ICE catheter to the atrium. There was no difference in the complication, acute and 1-year success rates, compared with fluoroscopy guided procedures. In the Extension phase, 97% of the procedures could be completed with complete ZF. In one case fluoroscopy was used to guide the transseptal puncture and in another to position the ICE catheter. Acute success of PVI was achieved in all cases, 64.4% patients were arrhythmia free at 1-year. Acute major complications were observed in 4 cases, all of these occurred in the redo PVI group and consisted of 2 tamponades, 1 transient ischemic attack and 1 pseudoaneurysm at the puncture site. The procedures were carried out by all members of the electrophysiology unit in the Extension phase, including less experienced operators and electrophysiology fellows (3 physicians) under the supervision of the senior electrophysiologist. Consequently, procedure times became longer [90 (75-105) vs 77.5 (73.5-85) min, p = 0.014].<h4>Conclusions</h4>According to our results, a ZF workflow of AF ablations can be successfully implemented into the routine practice of an electrophysiology laboratory, without compromising safety and effectivity.",https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12872-021-02219-8

This study aimed to reveal the clinical manifestations, risk factors, and treatment of fulminant MP pneumonia (MPP). Using PubMed and abstracts from the proceedings of several domestic Japanese academic societies, we reviewed the Japanese and English literature for cases of fulminant or severe MPP reported in Japan. All clinical information such as sex, age, underlying diseases, clinical symptoms, clinical course, laboratory and radiological findings, and treatment was collected and analyzed. In total, 52 fulminant MPP cases were reported between September, 1979 and February, 2010. The dominant population of fulminant MPP was young adults without severe underlying diseases. Cough (97.3%), fever (100.0%), and dyspnea (83.3%) with diffuse abnormal findings in radiological examinations were noted. Antibiotics without anti-mycoplasmal activity were used in 32 cases (61.5%) as initial treatment prior to the onset of hypoxia. Anti-mycoplasmal drugs were appropriately used in 41 cases (78.8%) after onset of respiratory failure with steroids (23 cases, 45.1%) and effective. The majority of patients improved within 3-5 days after steroid administration. There were only 2 fatal cases. Although this small retrospective study did not reveal the apparent risk factors of fulminant MPP, initial inappropriate use of antibiotics may be a risk factor, and early administration of appropriate anti-mycoplasmal drugs with steroids as a cellular immune suppressor is required.",

This phase I open-label study evaluated the safety and activity of brentuximab vedotin administered sequentially with CHOP or in combination with CHP (CHOP without vincristine) as front-line treatment in patients with CD30(+) PTCL.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Patients received sequential treatment (once every 3 weeks) with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg (two cycles) followed by CHOP (six cycles) or brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg plus CHP (BV+CHP) for six cycles (once every 3 weeks). Responders received single-agent brentuximab vedotin for eight to 10 additional cycles (for a total of 16 cycles). The primary objective was assessment of safety; secondary end points included objective response rate, complete remission (CR) rate, progression-free survival rate (PFS), and OS. There were no prespecified comparisons of the two treatment approaches.<h4>Results</h4>After sequential treatment, 11 (85%) of 13 patients achieved an objective response (CR rate, 62%; estimated 1-year PFS rate, 77%). Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in eight (62%) of 13 patients. At the end of combination treatment, all patients (n = 26) achieved an objective response (CR rate, 88%; estimated 1-year PFS rate, 71%). All seven patients without anaplastic large-cell lymphoma achieved CR. Grade 3/4 adverse events (≥ 10%) in the combination-treatment group were febrile neutropenia (31%), neutropenia (23%), anemia (15%), and pulmonary embolism (12%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Brentuximab vedotin, administered sequentially with CHOP or in combination with CHP, had a manageable safety profile and exhibited substantial antitumor activity in newly diagnosed patients with CD30(+) PTCL. A randomized phase III trial is under way, comparing BV+CHP with CHOP (clinical trial No. NCT01777152).",

Mutations of the protein kinase A regulatory subunit type 1alpha (R1alpha) (coded by the PRKAR1A gene) are found in more than half of CNC patients. In this study, we investigated whether PEM and EBN are related at the molecular level, and whether changes in the PRKAR1A gene status and the expression of the R1alpha protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of PEM and other melanocytic lesions. Histologic analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with R1alpha antibody were performed on 34 sporadic PEMs, 8 CNC-associated PEMs from patients with known PRKAR1A mutations, 297 benign and malignant melanocytic tumors (127 conventional sections of 10 compound nevi, 10 Spitz nevi, 5 deep-penetrating nevi, 5 blue nevi, 6 cellular blue nevi, 2 malignant blue nevi, 3 lentigo maligna, and 86 melanomas of various types); in addition, 170 tissue microarray sections consisting of 35 benign nevi, 60 primary melanomas, and 75 metastatic melanomas, and 5 equine dermal melanomas, were examined. Histologic diagnoses were based on preexisting pathologic reports and were confirmed for this study. DNA studies [loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the 17q22-24 locus and the PRKAR1A gene sequencing] were performed on 60 melanomas and 7 PEMs. IHC showed that R1alpha was expressed in all but one core from tissue microarrays (169/170), and in all 127 melanocytic lesions evaluated in conventional sections. By contrast, R1alpha was not expressed in the 8 EBN from patients with CNC and PRKAR1A mutations. Expression of R1alpha was lost in 28 of 34 PEMs (82%). R1alpha was expressed in the 5 equine melanomas studied. DNA studies correlated with IHC findings: there were no PRKAR1A mutations in any of the melanomas studied and the rate of LOH for 17q22-24 was less than 7%; 5 of the 7 PEMs showed extensive 17q22-24 LOH but no PRKAR1A mutations. The results support the concept that PEM is a distinct melanocytic tumor occurring in a sporadic setting and in the context of CNC. They also suggest that PEM differs from melanomas in equine melanotic disease, further arguing that the term animal-type melanoma may be a misnomer for this group of lesions. Loss of expression of R1alpha offers a useful diagnostic test that helps to distinguish PEM from lesions that mimic it histologically.",

It is characteristically expressed in certain hematopoietic malignancies, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, among others. The variable expression of CD30 on both normal and malignant lymphoid cells has focused research efforts on understanding the pathogenesis of CD30 upregulation, its contribution to lymphomagenesis through anti-apoptotic mechanisms, and its effect on cell survival. Given the restriction of CD30 to certain tumor types, the logical extension of this has been to attempt to exploit it as a therapeutic target. The efficacy of naked anti-CD30 antibodies in practice was, however, modest. Moreover, combinations with bacterial toxins and radioimmunoconjugates have also had limited success. The development of the antibody-drug compound brentuximab vedotin (BV), however, has rejuvenated interest in CD30 as a tumor target. Phase I and II clinical trials in Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and even CD30-expressing B-cell lymphomas, have shown the compound is well tolerated, but more importantly, able to deliver meaningful disease control even in patients with multiply relapsed or refractory disease. FDA approval has been granted for its use in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. A recent phase III trial of BV in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma has confirmed its superiority to standard of care therapies. In this manuscript, we explore the history of CD30 as a tumor marker and as a therapeutic target, both in the laboratory and in the clinic, with a view to understanding future avenues for further study.",https://www.nature.com/articles/bcj201785.pdf

However, it is unknown whether vasopressin treatment interacts with corticosteroid treatment.<h4>Design</h4>Post hoc substudy of a multicenter randomized blinded controlled trial of vasopressin vs. norepinephrine in septic shock.<h4>Setting</h4>Twenty-seven Intensive Care Units in Canada, Australia, and the United States.<h4>Patients</h4>: Seven hundred and seventy-nine patients who had septic shock and were ongoing hypotension requiring at least 5 microg/min of norepinephrine infusion for 6 hours.<h4>Interventions</h4>Patients were randomized to blinded vasopressin (0.01-0.03 units/min) or norepinephrine (5-15 microg/min) infusion added to open-label vasopressors. Corticosteroids were given according to clinical judgment at any time in the 28-day postrandomization period.<h4>Measurements</h4>The primary end point was 28-day mortality. We tested for interaction between vasopressin treatment and corticosteroid treatment using logistic regression. Secondary end points were organ dysfunction, use of open-label vasopressors and vasopressin levels.<h4>Main results</h4>There was a statistically significant interaction between vasopressin infusion and corticosteroid treatment (p = 0.008). In patients who had septic shock and were also treated with corticosteroids, vasopressin, compared to norepinephrine, was associated with significantly decreased mortality (35.9% vs. 44.7%, respectively, p = 0.03).

In patients who received vasopressin infusion, use of corticosteroids significantly increased plasma vasopressin levels by 33% at 6 hours (p = 0.006) to 67% at 24 hours (p = 0.025) compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a statistically significant interaction between vasopressin and corticosteroids. The combination of low-dose vasopressin and corticosteroids was associated with decreased mortality and organ dysfunction compared with norepinephrine and corticosteroids.",

Identifying the cause of acidosis is critical for its management. We describe a case of acute renal failure with lactic acidosis in a 69-year-old man who was taking metformin for type 2 diabetes. The patient presented with decreased urine output after two weeks of intermittent nausea and vomiting. During this time, the patient had continued to take limited fluids and medication, including lisinopril and metformin. Physical exam on initial evaluation was remarkable only for hypertension and minimal abdominal tenderness. However, laboratory tests revealed a severe lactic acidosis and renal failure with hyperkalemia. The patient had normal renal function and a normal urine albumin level three weeks prior. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and sodium bicarbonate were administered, followed by hemodialysis. During hemodialysis, the patient became hemodynamically unstable, requiring vasopressors. Post-dialysis, the lactic acidosis worsened, prompting the initiation of additional prolonged dialysis during the first hospital day. After the second lengthy dialysis, the patient's condition improved significantly and he was discharged on hospital day 12, with the diagnosis of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) in the setting of acute tubular necrosis from gastrointestinal fluid loss accompanied by the continued use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. After discharge, his renal function returned to normal. Severe lactic acidosis from metformin is relatively rare. Metformin has a large volume of distribution and accumulates in erythrocytes and intestinal cells, resulting in less efficient removal with dialysis and rebound lactic acidosis. Prolonged dialysis may be necessary for MALA to improve outcomes. Identifying metformin levels may help in diagnosis and management. However, the means to Identify metformin levels are not widely available. Patients receiving metformin should be counseled to stop metformin and seek medical care in the setting of illnesses. This is particularly important given the frequency of metformin prescription and the common use of renin-angiotensin system blockade in patients with type 2 diabetes, which increases the risk of kidney dysfunction.",https://www.cureus.com/articles/27772-a-unique-case-of-metformin-associated-severe-lactic-acidosis-without-preexisting-renal-disease-perspectives-on-prolonged-dialysis-and-education-for-prevention.pdf

Smoking, occupational carcinogens, analgesic abuse, Balkan nephropathy are the risk factors. Cytogenetic studies revealed that the most frequent aberration is the partial or complete loss of chromosome 9. Approximately 20-50% of patients with upper urinary tract (UUT) TCC have bladder cancer at some point on their course, whereas the incidence of UUT TCC after primary bladder cancer is 0.7-4%. Excretory urography and retrograde pyelography are the conventional diagnostic tools; however, ureteropyeloscopy combined with cytology and biopsy is more accurate. Grade and stage of the disease have the most significant impact on survival. Nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision has been the mainstay of treatment. Local resection may be appropriate for distal ureteral lesions especially when the disease is low grade and stage. Advances in endourology have made it possible to treat many tumors conservatively. Ureteroscopic and to a certain extent percutaneous surgical approaches are widely used today especially in patients with low grade, low stage disease. Endoscopic close surveillance is mandatory for these patients. Adjuvant topical therapies appear to be safe but confirmation of any benefits awaits the results of further large studies. More recently, laparoscopic techniques have become a viable alternative to open surgery, but long term cancer control data are lacking. Aggressive surgical resection does not affect the outcome of patients with advanced disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy is ineffective, and systemic chemotherapy results in a low complete response rate for patients with metastases.",

Furthermore, in contrast to other benign melanocytic proliferations, the lesional cells in EBN exhibit little or no maturation as they extend deeper into the underlying tissue. Blue nevi are the second most common form of nevus in the oral cavity. However, to our knowledge, the epithelioid variant has not been previously identified in the mouth.

We have divided them into infectious, drug-induced, ischemic, obstructive, and autoimmune etiologies. The bulk of the literature describes secondary sclerosing cholangitis in the critically ill patient. Secondary sclerosing cholangitis due to drugs or autoimmune causes seem to have the best prognosis. However, causes such as critical illness seem to have worse outcomes.",

Fusion proteins including the four zinc finger domains of WT1 were used to optimize expression and purification conditions and to characterize WT1:DNA interactions in the absence of WT1:WT1 interactions. Zinc finger protein for in vitro characterization was prepared by IMAC purification of WT1 residues 321-443 with a thioredoxin-hexahistidine N-terminal fusion, followed by 3C protease cleavage to liberate the zinc fingers and cation exchange chromatography to isolate the zinc fingers and reduce the level of the truncated forms. Titration of zinc finger domain with a binding site from the PDGFA promoter gave a K(d) of 100±30nM for the -KTS isoform and 130±40nM for the +KTS isoform. The zinc finger domain was also co-crystallized with a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide, yielding crystals that diffract to 5.5Å. Using protocols established for the zinc finger domain, we expressed soluble full-length WT1 with an N-terminal thioredoxin domain and purified the fusion protein by IMAC. In electro-mobility shift assays, purified full-length WT1 bound double-stranded oligonucleotides containing known WT1 binding sites, but not control oligonucleotides. Two molecules of WT1 bind an oligonucleotide presenting the full PDGFA promoter, demonstrating that active full-length WT1 can be produced in E. coli and used to investigate WT1 dimerization in complex with DNA in vitro.",

Therapeutic approaches are available to treat eating disorders but less than half of the patients recover. Therapeutic alternatives are needed such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. I reviewed studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of this technique for the treatment of eating disorders. The electronic literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, theta burst and deep transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of eating disorders was retrieved. The findings were quite heterogeneous in results with some studies showing relatively positive results with reduction of both craving and eating behaviors with active stimulation versus sham. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was safe. Research in this field was limited by the small number of studies and sample sizes, diversity of stimulation parameters, questionable placebo conditions, the lack of a sham-controlled design and the use of subjective scales lacking in sensitivity. The evidence supporting rTMS for eating disorders is somewhat promising. Future studies on high frequency rTMS of the LDLPFC/DMPFC with increased statistical power, rigorous randomization, outcome measures and optimal parameters are needed to confirm the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of rTMS for the treatment of eating disorders.",

The test corpus is a selection from sentences for speech quality evaluation recorded with a male unschooled speaker. Performance-intensity curves were measured for each individual sentence in a speech-simulating babble noise with a total of 40 normal-hearing listeners. Based on these data and the phonemic transcription of the 200 sentences selected from the underlying speech corpus, 20 test lists were composed using a numerical optimization process. These 20 test lists are highly equivalent with respect to their performance-intensity curves, the number of words within each test list, the number of phonemes within each test list, and approximately the frequency distribution of the phonemes which approximates the phoneme frequency distribution of the German language. The equivalence of the respective performance-intensity curves was demonstrated in an independent experiment with 20 normal-hearing listeners. In addition, a comparison was performed between the ""objective"" intelligibility measurements and two ""subjective"" speech intelligibility rating methods employing the same materials. As a result, both subjective assessment procedures correlate highly with each other and with the ""objective"" procedure across sentences. This underlines the applicability and validity of the test in combination with time-saving subjective assessment methods. Moreover, the variability in performance across different sentences correlates inversely with the RMS level of the respective sentence. This indicates that an adjustment of sentence material with respect to RMS level already yield reasonably homogeneous test material with respect to intelligibility.",

CHF due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a familial disease in 20-30% of cases and is associated with mutations in genes encoding cytoskeletal, contractile or inner-nuclear membrane proteins. We show that mutations in the gene encoding giant-muscle filament titin (TTN) cause autosomal dominant DCM linked to chromosome 2q31 (CMD1G; MIM 604145). Titin molecules extend from sarcomeric Z-discs to M-lines, provide an extensible scaffold for the contractile machinery and are crucial for myofibrillar elasticity and integrity. In a large DCM kindred, a segregating 2-bp insertion mutation in TTN exon 326 causes a frameshift, truncating A-band titin. The truncated protein of approximately 2 mD is expressed in skeletal muscle, but western blot studies with epitope-specific anti-titin antibodies suggest that the mutant protein is truncated to a 1.14-mD subfragment by site-specific cleavage. In another large family with DCM linked to CMD1G, a TTN missense mutation (Trp930Arg) is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved hydrophobic core sequence of an immunoglobulin fold located in the Z-disc-I-band transition zone. The identification of TTN mutations in individuals with CMD1G should provide further insights into the pathogenesis of familial forms of CHF and myofibrillar titin turnover.",

All patients presenting to the ED with a diagnosis of upper tract urolithiasis were analyzed. Admission rates and total cost were compared by region, hospital type, and payer type. Numbers are weighted estimates that are designed to approximate the total national rate.<h4>Results</h4>An average of 1.2 million patients per year were identified with the diagnosis of urolithiasis out of 120 million visits to the ED annually. Overall average rate of admission was 19.21%. Admission rates were highest in the Northeast (24.88%), among teaching hospitals (22.27%), and among Medicare patients (42.04%). The lowest admission rates were noted for self-pay patients (9.76%) and nonmetropolitan hospitals (13.49%). The smallest increases in costs over time were noted in the Northeast. Total costs were least in nonmetropolitan hospitals; however, more patients were transferred to other hospitals. When assessing hospital ownership status, private for-profit hospitals had similar admission rates compared with private not-for-profit hospitals (16.6% vs 15.9%); however, costs were 64% and 48% higher for ED and inpatient admission costs, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Presentation of urolithiasis to the ED is common, and is associated with significant costs to the medical system, which are increasing over time. Costs and rates of admission differ by region, payer type, and hospital type, which may allow us to identify the causes for cost discrepancies and areas to improve efficiency of care delivery.",

The level of suppression of the adaptive immune response is strain dependent. The early events of antigen presentation require activation of toll-like receptors that results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Non-cytopathic (ncp) BVDV infection stimulates cytokines from macrophages in vitro but the effect of BVDV infection in vivo on macrophages or in vitro with monocytes is not clear. Antigen presentation is decreased and co-stimulatory molecules are down regulated. T-lymphocytes numbers are reduced following BVDV infection in a strain dependent manner. There is recruitment of lymphocytes to the bronchial alveolar space following cytopathic (cp) BVDV infection. Depletion of T-lymphocytes occurs in the lymphoid tissue and is strain dependent. BVDV cp T-lymphocyte responses appear to be primarily a T helper 1 response while the response following ncp BVDV induces a T helper 2 response. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), an important BVDV defense mechanism are compromised. The major neutralizing antigens are well characterized but cross-protection between strains is variable. PI animals have normal adaptive immune responses with the exception of the PI strain immunotolerance and mucosal disease may be a function of the level of gamma delta T cells.",

They had no underlying disease previously. All the 3 cases had onset of fever, cough as main symptoms. Diagnosis of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia was made, which was accompanied by decreased neutrophils [(0.08-0.68)×10(9)/L], hemoglobin [(79-103) g/L], platelet [(64-157)×10(9)/L], plasma fibrinogen [(1.3-1.5) g/L], lactate dehydrogenase [(1,170-1,285) U/L] and increased serum ferritin [(936.7-39 789.0) µg/L] in the third week of course. In two cases the T lymphocytes decreased, and the NK cell activity decreased significantly in one. Bone marrow cytology showed prompted bone marrow hyperplasia, and the phenomenon of phagocytosed blood cells. CT scan was performed for all the cases and consolidation with pleural effusion were shown. Two cases were admitted to PICU, and required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Flexible bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage were performed and bronchial cast was found in two cases. All of them were treated with macrolide combined with other antibiotics, glucocorticoids and gamma globulin combination therapy, including one case given dexamethasone [10 mg/(m2·d)], cyclosporine[6 mg/(kg·d)], etoposide [150 mg/(m2·d)] chemotherapy. Two cases were cured, and 1 case died. The authors summarized the 18 cases reported in domestic and foreign literature. Foreign children were diagnosed and treated with steroids in 1-2 weeks, and 10 cases were cured, and 2 cases died. They died of massive hemorrhage and meningoencephalitis, and domestic children were diagnosed and treated within two to 4 weeks after onset, 5 cases were cured, one case died of severe pneumonia.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MP-HLH is a rare disease in children, and had acute onset, rapid progression and high mortality. Early treatment with steroids was associated with a good prognosis, the key to successful treatment is early diagnosis and treatment, avoiding the immune cascade. Too late a diagnosis or development of serious complications may lead to death.",

We report an investigation into the admission characteristics and clinical outcomes associated with liver dysfunction in a large cohort of adults hospitalized for medical stabilization of severe AN.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively evaluated electronic medical records to quantify the cumulative incidence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). We compared mean (±SD), frequencies (%), and median (IQR) values of clinical covariates of interest by incidence of liver enzyme elevation. The study included 181 adults, admitted for medical stabilization of AN, from October 1, 2008 to December 31, 2013.<h4>Results</h4>AST and ALT were mildly elevated in 27.6% of patients and severely elevated (more than three times the upper limit of normal) in 35.4% of patients. On admission, patients with severely elevated liver enzymes had a lower body mass index (BMI) (11.9 ± 1.8 kg/m(2) vs.13.3 ± 1.7 kg/m(2)), lower percentage ideal body weight (56.5% ± 7.7% vs. 63.5% ± 8.3%), and lower prealbumin (64% vs. 37%) compared with the rest of the cohort (p < 0.001). While hospitalized, patients with severely elevated liver enzymes more often developed hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and experienced longer lengths of stay (p < 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>Elevated liver enzymes are common in our patient population with severe AN. Liver enzymes reached near normal values by the time of discharge. Severely elevated liver enzymes were associated with a lower BMI and the development of hypoglycemia.",

Advanced disease at diagnosis is a poor prognostic factor, suggesting that earlier detection may improve outcome. No systematic analysis has been published to define the clinical features that are characteristic of MCC.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to define the clinical characteristics present at diagnosis to identify features that may aid clinicians in recognizing MCC.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cohort study of 195 patients given the diagnosis of MCC between 1980 and 2007. Data were collected prospectively in the majority of cases, and medical records were reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>An important finding was that 88% of MCCs were asymptomatic (nontender) despite rapid growth in the prior 3 months (63% of lesions) and being red or pink (56%). A majority of MCC lesions (56%) were presumed at biopsy to be benign, with a cyst/acneiform lesion being the single most common diagnosis (32%) given. The median delay from lesion appearance to biopsy was 3 months (range 1-54 months), and median tumor diameter was 1.8 cm. Similar to earlier studies, 81% of primary MCCs occurred on ultraviolet-exposed sites, and our cohort was elderly (90% >50 years), predominantly white (98%), and often profoundly immune suppressed (7.8%). An additional novel finding was that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was more than 30-fold overrepresented among patients with MCC.<h4>Limitations</h4>The study was limited to patients seen at a tertiary care center. Complete clinical data could not be obtained on all patients. This study could not assess the specificity of the clinical characteristics of MCC.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge, this study is the first to define clinical features that may serve as clues in the diagnosis of MCC. The most significant features can be summarized in an acronym: AEIOU (asymptomatic/lack of tenderness, expanding rapidly, immune suppression, older than 50 years, and ultraviolet-exposed site on a person with fair skin). In our series, 89% of primary MCCs had 3 or more of these findings. Although MCC is uncommon, when present in combination, these features may indicate a concerning process that would warrant biopsy. In particular, a lesion that is red and expanding rapidly yet asymptomatic should be of concern.",

A phase Ib/II study was undertaken to evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary efficacy of the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) naïve to intensive chemotherapy. Thirty-nine patients (AML=29, MDS=10) received azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously (days 1-5) and oral panobinostat (starting on day 5, thrice weekly for seven doses) in 28-day cycles until toxicity or disease progression. Dose-limiting toxicities during the phase Ib stage were observed in 0/4 patients receiving 10 mg panobinostat, in 1/7 patients (fatigue) receiving 20 mg, in 1/6 patients (fatigue) receiving 30 mg and in 4/5 patients (fatigue, syncope, hyponatremia and somnolence) receiving 40 mg. In phase II, an additional 17 patients received panobinostat at a MTD of 30 mg. The overall response rate (ORR=CR+CRi+PR) in patients with AML was 31% (9/29) and that in patients with MDS was 50% (5/10). After a median follow-up of 13 months, the median overall survival was 8 and 16 months in patients with AML and MDS, respectively. Increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation was a useful early biomarker of clinical response. Combining panobinostat with azacitidine was tolerable and clinically active in high-risk MDS/AML patients, warranting further exploration.",https://www.nature.com/articles/bcj201368.pdf

Mortality rate of sepsis is close to 30% to 50% despite better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, and advances in antimicrobial therapy, resuscitation strategies, and mechanical ventilation. Liver failure is characterized by accumulation of potentially toxic substances in the systemic circulation of the patient. Toxic effects of these molecules can induce cellular injuries leading to multiorgan dysfunction. Hydrophobic unconjugated bilirubin and bile acids, hydrophilic conjugated bilirubin, and ammonium are the main toxins accumulated in liver failure. We carried out cytokine adsorbtion (CytoSorb) procedure with continuous venovenous hemodialysis in 12-hour sessions. The biochemical values of the patients before and after the use of the filter were recorded. The parameters compared were as follows: total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, C-reactive protein, leukocyte, neutrophil, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, colloid oncotic pressure, ammonia, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, procalcitonin, hematocrit, hemoglobin, pH, albumin, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, platelet, temperature, changes in vasoactive medication requirement, temperature. According to these results, cytokine adsorption systems can be considered as an option to lower bilirubin levels in cases of liver failure. Its inability to lower ammonia level is considered a disadvantage compared with other bilirubin-lowering methods. Although further studies are needed to compare different methods, cytokine adsorption systems may be considered in treatment planning as it contributes to the treatment of sepsis and hyperbilirubinemia in liver failure patients with sepsis.",

We performed a systematic review to examine the efficacy and safety of 3 albumin dialysis systems (molecular adsorbent recirculating system [MARS], fractionated plasma separation, adsorption and hemodialysis [Prometheus system], and single-pass albumin dialysis) in randomized trials for supportive treatment of liver failure. PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, Cochrane's Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. Two authors independently screened citations and extracted data on patient characteristics, quality of reports, efficacy, and safety end points. Ten trials (7 of MARS and 3 of Prometheus) were identified (620 patients). By meta-analysis, albumin dialysis achieved a net decrease in serum total bilirubin level relative to standard medical therapy of 8.0 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], -10.6 to -5.4) but not in serum ammonia or bile acids. Albumin dialysis achieved an improvement in hepatic encephalopathy relative to standard medical therapy with a risk ratio of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.16-2.08) but had no effect survival with a risk ratio of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.84-1.07). Because of inconsistency in the reporting of adverse events, the safety analysis was limited but did not demonstrate major safety concerns. Use of albumin dialysis as supportive treatment for liver failure is successful at removing albumin-bound molecules, such as bilirubin and at improving hepatic encephalopathy. Additional experience is required to guide its optimal use and address safety concerns.",

A relatively high incidence of pericardial disease has been noticed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed a population of patients with advanced NSCLC receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) looking for the presence of pericardial effusion at baseline or during treatment. The study population was compared with a control group treated with chemotherapy. All patients were checked for the presence of concomitant pleural effusion.<h4>Results</h4>We identify 60 patients (36 male/24 female, median age 70 years [range 43-81]). Prevalent histology was adenocarcinoma (65%) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (28%) and large cell or not otherwise specified (NOS) carcinoma (7%). Treatment consisted of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 14 days (52 cases; 45 as second-line and 7 as third-line treatment) or pembrolizumab 200 mg (8 cases; all first-line treatment) for a total of 302 cycles delivered.

Case presentations and multimodal imaging, including color photographs, near-infrared reflectance, fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT), and orbital color Doppler imaging, are described. Baseline and follow-up findings are correlated with clinical presentation, demographics, and systemic associations.<h4>Results</h4>Five men and 4 women, aged 27-66 years, were included. Isolated band-like hyperreflective lesions in the middle retinal layers, otherwise known as paracentral acute middle maculopathy, were observed in all patients at baseline presentation. Follow-up SD OCT analysis of these paracentral acute middle maculopathy lesions demonstrated subsequent thinning of the inner nuclear layer. Novel retinal vascular associations leading to retinal vasculopathy and paracentral acute middle maculopathy include eye compression injury causing global ocular ischemia, sickle cell crisis, Purtscher's retinopathy, inflammatory occlusive retinal vasculitis, post-H1N1 vaccine, hypertensive retinopathy, migraine disorder, and post-upper respiratory infection.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Paracentral acute middle maculopathy lesions may develop in a wide spectrum of retinal vascular diseases. They are best identified with SD OCT analysis and may represent ischemia of the intermediate and deep capillary plexus. These lesions typically result in permanent thinning of the inner nuclear layer and are critical to identify in order to determine the cause of unexplained vision loss.",

We have designated these lesions as pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM). Herein, we present a clinical-pathologic analysis of 41 consecutive PEM from 40 patients and compare them with 11 epithelioid blue nevi from patients with Carney complex. PEM occurred in both sexes of different ethnic backgrounds, including white, Hispanic, black, Asian, and Persian. The median age of occurrence was 27 years (range 0.6-78 years). Tumors had wide distribution with extremities being the most common site. The tumors were formed by deep dermal (mean Breslow's thickness 3.3 mm) proliferation of heavily pigmented epithelioid and/or spindled melanocytes. Five lesions were part of combined nevus. Ulceration was present in 7 cases. Tumor necrosis was present in 1 case. Regional lymph nodes were sampled in 24 cases (59%). In 11 cases, lymph nodes contained metastases (46%). Liver metastases occurred in 1 case. None of the patients died of disease. Clinical follow-up of more than a year (mean 32 months, range up to 67 months) was available in 27 cases (67%). We found no histologic criteria separating metastasizing and nonmetastasizing PEM. Ulceration was the only feature more common in PEM than epithelioid blue nevi of Carney complex. Otherwise, they were histologically indistinguishable. Our data show that PEM is a unique low-grade variant of melanoma with frequent lymph node metastases but indolent clinical course.

They are divided into three major groups: trematodes (flukes), which are leaf-shaped, hermaphroditic (except for blood flukes) flatworms with oral and ventral suckers; cestodes (tapeworms), which are segmented, hermaphroditic flatworms that inhabit the intestinal lumen; and nematodes (roundworms), which are dioecious, cylindrical parasites that inhabit intestinal and peripheral tissue sites. Helminths exhibit a sublime co-evolution with the host's immune system that has enabled them to successfully colonize almost all multicellular species present in every geographical environment, including over two billion humans. In the face of this challenge, the host immune system has evolved to strike a delicate balance between attempts to neutralize the infectious assault versus limitation of damage to host tissues. Among the most important cell types during helminthic invasion are granulocytes: eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils. Depending on the specific context, these leukocytes may have pivotal roles in host protection, immunopathology, or facilitation of helminth establishment. This review provides an overview of the function of granulocytes in helminthic infections.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3394172?pdf=render

Several risk factors for CNS metastases have been reported. The objective of the current study was to describe clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic factors in breast cancer patients with CNS metastases.<h4>Methods</h4>The authors retrospectively evaluated clinical data from 420 patients who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and CNS metastasis between 1994 and 2004 at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.<h4>Results</h4>The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer was 45 years (range, 25-77 years). Premenopausal and postmenopausal patients were distributed equally. Most patients had invasive ductal histology (91.2%), grade 3 tumors (81.4%) (using the modified Black nuclear grading system), T2 tumor classification (40.1%), and N1 lymph node status (59.7%) diagnosis. Forty percent of patients had estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease, and 34% had progesterone receptor-positive disease. HER-2/neu status was recorded for only 248 patients, and 39% of the patients in that group had HER-2/neu-positive disease. The most common sites of first metastasis were liver, bone, and lung. CNS metastasis was the site of first recurrence in 53 patients (12%). In total, 329 patients had received either neoadjuvant treatment (113 patients) or adjuvant chemotherapy (216 patients). The majority of those patients (74.4%) had received anthracycline-based regimens. Metastasis was solitary in 111 patients (26.4%), and 29 patients had only leptomeningeal metastases. The median time from breast cancer diagnosis to CNS metastasis was 30.9 months (range, from -5 months to 216.7 months). The median follow-up after a diagnosis of CNS metastasis was 6 months (range, 7-95.9 months). In all, 359 patients died, and the overall median survival was 6.8 months. Only age at diagnosis and ER status were associated significantly with overall survival in the multivariate analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The current results indicated that the prognosis remains patients with breast cancer metastatic to the CNS. More effective treatment approaches are needed for patients with CNS metastases, even for those with favorable prognostic factors, such as ER-positive tumors or younger age.",

Nasal swab specimens, fecal samples, and serum samples were obtained before shipping, at arrival, and periodically thereafter. Bovine coronavirus antigen and antibodies were detected by use of an ELISA.<h4>Results</h4>NM calves had a high geometric mean titer for BCV antibody at arrival (GMT, 1,928); only 2% shed BCV in nasal secretions and 1% in feces. In contrast, AR calves had low antibody titers against BCV at arrival (GMT, 102) and 64% shed BCV in nasal secretions and 65% in feces. Detection of BCV in nasal secretions preceded detection in feces before shipping AR calves, but at arrival, 73% of AR calves were shedding BCV in nasal secretions and feces. Bovine coronavirus infection was significantly associated with respiratory tract disease and decreased growth performance in AR calves.<h4>Conclusions and clinical relevance</h4>Replication and shedding of BCV may start in the upper respiratory tract and spread to the gastrointestinal tract. Vaccination of calves against BCV before shipping to feedlots may provide protection against BCV infection and its effects with other pathogens in the induction of respiratory tract disease.",

Of the patients treated with SRS alone, 1 patient had radiographic local progression of disease and 1 patient had a distant intracranial failure. Of the patients treated with WBRT with or without an SRS boost, 9 patients developed intracranial progression, including 1 local failure. No differences in rates of intracranial progression or local failure between the 2 groups (P = .94 and P = .44, respectively) were observed. The actuarial rates of distant intracranial failure at 12 months were 32.9% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 8.9%-56.8%) and 25% (95% CI 0.0%-67.4%) in patients undergoing primary WBRT or SRS, respectively (P = .31). The median overall survival was 15.8 months in patients treated with WBRT and 20.4 months in patients treated with primary SRS (P = .78).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patients with brain metastasis from PNECs can be effectively treated with either WBRT or SRS alone, with a pattern of failure more consistent with non-small cell lung cancer than small cell lung cancer. In this series, there was not a statistically significant increased risk of distant intracranial failure when patients were treated with primary SRS.",

Competing risk regression analyses were used to determine the cumulative risk of developing MDS. All statistical tests were two-sided.<h4>Results</h4>Of 10924 patients, 5119 (47%) received radiation (n = 2183 [43%] in EBRT group and n = 2936 [57%] in PI group) and 5805 (53%) were treated with RP. Overall, 31 cases of MDS were observed, with age-adjusted incidence rates no higher than in population-based registries. In univariate analyses, advancing age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.20; P < .001) and radiotherapy exposure (HR = 3.44; 95% CI = 1.41 to 8.37; P = .007) were statistically significantly associated with development of MDS. In multivariable analyses, although advanced age (HR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.19; P < .001) remained statistically associated with MDS, radiation did not, although a small non-statistically significant trend existed for PI-treated patients. MDS rates were no higher than in population-based registries.<h4>Conclusions</h4>With relatively short follow-up, prostate cancer patients definitively treated with radiation did not appear to have a statistically increased risk of subsequent MDS.",

This study presents an updated analysis of the initial experience of the Lymphoma Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) describing the outcomes after allo-HSCT for MF and SS, with special emphasis on the impact of the use of unrelated donors (URD).<h4>Methods and patients</h4>Eligible for this study were patients with advanced-stage MF or SS who underwent a first allo-HSCT from matched HLA-identical related or URD between January/1997 and December/2011. Sixty patients have been previously reported.<h4>Results</h4>113 patients were included [77 MF (68%)]; 61 (54%) were in complete or partial remission, 86 (76%) received reduced-intensity protocols and 44 (39%) an URD allo-HSCT. With a median follow up for surviving patients of 73 months, allo-HSCT resulted in an estimated overall survival (OS) of 38% at 5 years, and a progression-free survival (PFS) of 26% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that advanced-phase disease (complete remission/partial remission >3, primary refractory or relapse/progression in patients that had received 3 or more lines of systemic treatment prior to transplant or the number of treatment lines was not known), a short interval between diagnosis and transplant (<18 months) were independent adverse prognostic factors for PFS; advanced-phase disease and the use of URDs were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This extended series supports that allo-HSCT is able to effectively rescue over one third of the population of patients with advanced-stage MF/SS. High relapse rate is still the major cause of failure and needs to be improved with better strategies before and after transplant. The negative impact of URD is a matter of concern and needs to be further elucidated in future studies.",

There are few reports of children with AIDS and TB. We report the manifestations, clinical course and outcome of 12 pediatric patients with AIDS and TB.<h4>Methods</h4>The charts of all children admitted to our institution, from 1989 through 1994, with the diagnoses of AIDS and culture-proved TB were reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve children between the ages of 2 months and 13 years fit the criteria. The mean time between the diagnosis of AIDS and TB was 20 months. The most frequent presenting symptoms were fever (75%) and tachypnea (33%). All had negative Mantoux tests (5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative). Extrapulmonary TB was present in 3 (25%). A source case was identified for 4 (33%). Previous pulmonary disease was present in 7 (58%). Chest roentgenograms were abnormal in 11 (91%), with diffuse interstitial infiltration the most common finding. Susceptibility tests were performed on 10 strains, 3 of which were resistant to 1 or more antituberculosis drugs. Three patients (25%) died of TB, 1 of whom was appropriately treated with antituberculosis drugs but had a strain resistant to isoniazid and rifampin.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Children with AIDS and TB most frequently present with atypical manifestations of TB.

Interventions ranged from patient education, to prone positioning, to early mobilization and respiratory therapy. Patients were often unstable with quick exacerbation of symptoms and a slow and fluctuant recovery. Additionally, many patients who were critically ill developed severe weakness, postextubation dysphagia, weaning failure, or presented with anxiety or delirium. In this setting, physical therapy was challenging and required specialized and individualized therapeutic strategies. Most patients adopted the proposed treatment strategies, and lung function and physical strength improved over time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Physical therapists clearly have a role in the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our experience in Switzerland, we recommend that physical therapists routinely screen and assess patients for respiratory symptoms and exercise tolerance on acute wards. Treatment of patients who are critically ill should start as soon as possible to limit further sequelae. More research is needed for awake prone positioning and early breathing exercises as well as post-COVID rehabilitation.<h4>Impact</h4>To date, there are few data on the physical therapist management of patients with COVID-19.

Homozygous mutations of WT1 can be found in approximately 15% of Wilms' tumors. Furthermore, somatic heterozygous loss of WT1 is known to lead to cryptorchidism and hypospadias in males. A much more severe phenotype is seen in patients with Denys-Drash syndrome which results from heterozygous dominant-negative mutations of the gene. Characteristic features are mesangial sclerosis with early kidney failure, varying degrees of gonadal dysgenesis and high risk of Wilms' tumors. Here we show that a related disease, Frasier syndrome, characterized by focal glomerular sclerosis, delayed kidney failure and complete gonadal dysgenesis, is probably caused by specific intronic point mutations of WT1 that preferentially affect a CpG dinucleotide. Disruption of alternative splicing at the exon 9 splice donor site prevents synthesis of the usually more abundant WT1 +KTS isoform from the mutant allele. In contrast to Denys-Drash syndrome, no mutant protein is produced. The splice mutation leads to an imbalance of WT1 isoforms in vivo , as detected by RT-PCR on streak gonadal tissue. Thus, WT1 isoforms must have quite different functions, and the pathology of Frasier syndrome suggests that especially gonadal development may be particularly sensitive to imbalance or relative underrepresentation of the WT1 +KTS isoform.",

High-volume therapeutic plasma exchange (HV-TPE) has been demonstrated in a large randomized controlled trial to improve survival. Here, we investigated if a more cost-/ resource effective low-volume (LV) TPE strategy might have comparable beneficial effects.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study evaluated the effect of LV-TPE on remote organ failure, hemodynamical and biochemical parameters as well as on survival in patients with ALF. Twenty patients treated with LV-TPE in addition to standard medical therapy (SMT) were identified and 1:1 matched to a historical ALF cohort treated with SMT only. Clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded at admission to the intensive care unit and the following 7 days after LV-TPE.<h4>Results</h4>Mean arterial pressure increased following first LV-TPE treatments (d0: 68 [61-75] mm Hg vs d7: 88 [79-98] mm Hg, P = .003) and norepinephrine dose was reduced (d0: 0.264 [0.051-0.906] μg/kg/min vs d3: 0 [0-0.024] μg/kg/min, P = .016).

SD OCT imaging analysis was employed to characterize the presence of superficial and deep capillary ischemia in each eye.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 40 eyes, 15 eyes had central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), 22 eyes had branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), and 3 eyes had cilioretinal artery occlusion. During the acute phase, SD OCT showed the following 3 distinct patterns, related to retinal ischemia occurring at varying levels within the retina: (1) thickening and hyperreflectivity of the inner retinal layers, including the nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers owing to ischemia of the superficial capillary plexus; (2) a hyperreflective band at the level of the inner nuclear layer, termed ""paracentral acute middle maculopathy,"" representing ischemia of the intermediate and deep retinal capillary plexuses (deep capillary ischemia); and (3) diffuse thickening and hyperreflectivity of both the inner and middle retinal layers, which represented both superficial and deep capillary ischemia. Of all eyes, 31 (78%) had both superficial and deep lesions. The remaining 9 eyes (22%) had isolated deep capillary ischemia producing paracentral acute middle maculopathy with sparing of the superficial capillary plexus and a normal fluorescein angiographic appearance. As the lesions evolved into the chronic phase over the ensuing 3 months, the resultant thinning and atrophy reflected the retinal layers affected during the acute phase.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SD OCT imaging reveals the spectrum of capillary ischemia in retinal artery occlusive disease showing variable involvement of the superficial and intermediate/deep capillary plexuses. Isolated deep capillary ischemia manifested as paracentral acute middle maculopathy on SD OCT and may be seen in some eyes with retinal arterial circulation compromise despite complete absence of perfusion abnormalities on fluorescein angiography.",

Loss of expression of a Carney complex gene, cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit 1alpha, is observed in the majority of PEMs. Initial reports with short-term follow-up have suggested that although PEMs frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, they have a more favorable outcome than conventional melanomas. In this report, we present the results of long-term follow-up in 26 patients with PEMs from North America and Australia. There were 9 males and 17 females, with a median age of 20 years. The tumors involved the trunk (6 cases), extremities (12 cases), genitalia (1 case), and the head and neck region (7 cases) had a median Breslow thickness of 2.2 mm (range 0.80 to 10.0 mm) and a median Clark level of 4. Eight of the patients developed lymph node metastases. After a median follow-up period of 67 months (range 39 to 216 mo), all patients are alive and free of disease.

Median age at diagnosis was 3 years. Three months was the median time from symptom development to diagnosis. Common MRI findings included diffuse leptomeningeal thickening, nodularity, or coating of the subarachnoid or ependymal surfaces. The leptomeningeal lesions often appear cystic and contrast enhancement was variable. Six patients had leptomeningeal involvement of the brain and spine. All patients had a negative CSF cytology. Biopsies demonstrated thickened meninges infiltrated by a monotonous population of oligodendrocyte-like cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed variable features of neuronal and/or glial differentiation. All samples were negative for BRAF V600E mutation by immunohistochemistry. Therapy included one patient treated with craniospinal irradiation followed by vincristine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin with stable disease for 164 months. Six patients received carboplatin and vincristine with a median duration of response of 20+ months (15-122+). Three patients received temozolomide upfront and progressed at 3, 4, and 27 months. No patients demonstrated complete or partial responses to any chemotherapy regimens. Progression-free survival ranged from 3 to 164+ months; 4/7 patients remained free of progression.

Variants in two key genes, SRY and its target SOX9, are an established cause of 46,XY DSD, but the genetic basis of many DSDs remains unknown. SRY-mediated SOX9 upregulation in the early gonad is crucial for testis development, yet the regulatory elements underlying this have not been identified in humans. Here, we identified four DSD patients with overlapping duplications or deletions upstream of SOX9. Bioinformatic analysis identified three putative enhancers for SOX9 that responded to different combinations of testis-specific regulators. All three enhancers showed synergistic activity and together drive SOX9 in the testis. This is the first study to identify SOX9 enhancers that, when duplicated or deleted, result in 46,XX or 46,XY sex reversal, respectively. These enhancers provide a hitherto missing link by which SRY activates SOX9 in humans, and establish SOX9 enhancer mutations as a significant cause of DSD.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07784-9.pdf

A systematic evaluation of the nerve of origin and the precise location of cochleovestibular schwannomas using our respective archival temporal bone collections was conducted. Forty tumors were within the internal auditory canal (IAC), while 10 were intralabyrinthine neoplasms. Of the 40 IAC schwannomas, 4 arose from the cochlear nerve, and 36 from the vestibular nerve. Twenty-one tumors clearly arose lateral to the glial-Schwann cell junction, while 16 tumors filled at least two thirds of the IAC, with the epicenter of the neoplasm located in the mid part or the lateral part of the IAC. Only 3 schwannomas were located in the medial one third of the IAC in the area of the glial-Schwann cell junction. We concluded that cochleovestibular schwannomas may arise anywhere along the course of the axons of the eighth cranial nerve from the glial-Schwann sheath junction up until their terminations within the auditory and vestibular end organs.",

However, there have been some sporadic case reports, describing a temporal association of influenza vaccination with onset or relapse of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. The nature of this association, beyond time of occurrence, remains unknown. The presentation of a previously healthy patient who developed ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) shortly after influenza vaccination provided us with the rare opportunity to study the possible mechanisms behind this observation. We tested the ability of different types and batches of influenza vaccines to stimulate proteinase-3 ANCA (PR3-ANCA) production in vitro. We found that only some influenza vaccines stimulated PR3-ANCA production in this patient. We demonstrated that this unusual response was associated with those vaccines that contained viral ribonucleic acid (RNA), the natural ligand for Toll-like receptor-7. Exome sequencing of the patient's DNA did not show any mutation in any of the molecules associated with Toll-like receptor signalling. We propose that hyper-reaction to viral RNA in the influenza vaccine may have contributed to the development of AAV following influenza vaccination in this patient.",

Numerous multiparametric scoring systems and diagnostic algorithms have been proposed to differentiate adrenocortical adenoma from adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenocortical neoplasms must also be differentiated from other primary adrenal tumours, such as phaeochromocytoma and unusual primary adrenal tumours, as well as metastases to the adrenal gland. Myxoid, oncocytic and sarcomatoid variants of adrenocortical tumours must be recognized so that they are not confused with other tumours. The diagnostic criteria for oncocytic adrenocortical carcinoma are different from those for conventional adrenocortical carcinomas. Adrenocortical neoplasms in children are particularly challenging to diagnose, as histological features of malignancy in adrenocortical neoplasms in adults may not be associated with aggressive disease in the tumours of children. Recent histological and immunohistochemical studies and more comprehensive and integrated genomic characterizations continue to advance our understanding of the tumorigenesis of these aggressive neoplasms, and may provide additional diagnostic and prognostic utility and guide the development of therapeutic targets.",

Information collected systematically in 1972 to 1973, before the onset of AN, was used to examine prospective risk factors for AN.<h4>Setting</h4>Population-based sample of twins in Sweden.<h4>Participants</h4>Cases of AN were identified as those individuals who met full DSM-IV criteria by means of clinical interview of the Swedish Twin Registry, who had a hospital discharge diagnosis of AN, or who had a cause-of-death certificate including an AN diagnosis.<h4>Results</h4>The overall prevalence of AN was 1.20% and 0.29% for female and male participants, respectively. The prevalence of AN in both sexes was greater among those born after 1945. Individuals with lifetime AN reported lower body mass index, greater physical activity, and better health satisfaction than those without lifetime AN. Anorexia nervosa was inversely associated with the development of overweight (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.54 [P<.001]). The heritability of narrowly defined DSM-IV AN (additive genetic effects) was estimated to be a(2) = 0.56 (95% CI, 0.00-0.87), with the remaining variance attributable to shared environment (c(2) = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.00-0.64) and unique environment (e(2) = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.13-0.84). Neuroticism measured about 3 decades before the diagnostic assessment was significantly associated with the development of later AN (odds ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.27-2.05 [P<.001]).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of AN was higher in both male and female participants born after 1945. Individuals who survive AN and who no longer have body mass indexes in the AN range appear to be at lower risk for the development of overweight. Prospectively assessed neuroticism was associated with the subsequent development of AN, the liability to which is under considerable genetic influence.",

A prospective study was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit of a university hospital. Seven patients receiving CVVH with a triacetate hollow-fibre dialyser were enrolled. CVVH was performed in pre-dilution mode with a blood flow rate of 200-250 mL/min and an ultrafiltrate flow rate of 800-1200 mL/h. To determine vancomycin pharmacokinetics, serum and ultrafiltrate were collected over 12 h after a 2-h infusion of 1000 mg vancomycin. The mean (± standard deviation) sieving coefficient of vancomycin was 0.71±0.13, which is consistent with previously reported values. Clearance of vancomycin by CVVH (0.73±0.21 L/h or 12.11±3.50 mL/min) constituted 49.4±20.8% of total vancomycin clearance (1.59±0.47 L/h) and was consistent with previously reported clearances. Approximately one-fifth of the vancomycin dose was removed during the 12-h CVVH (213.9±104.0 mg). The volume of distribution was 24.69±11.00 L, which is smaller than previously reported. The elimination rate constant and terminal half-life were 0.08±0.05 h(-1) and 12.02±7.00 h, respectively. In conclusion, elimination of vancomycin by CVVH contributed to ca. 50% of the total elimination in critically ill patients. The maintenance dose of vancomycin, calculated from parameters from patients in this study, would be 500-750 mg every 12 h to provide a steady-state trough concentration of 15-20 mg/L. Owing to alterations in clinical conditions, serum vancomycin concentrations must be closely monitored in critically ill patients.",

Neurology,"Since its discovery in 2007, the encephalitis associated with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has entered the mainstream of neurology and other disciplines. Most patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability. The disorder predominantly affects children and young adults, occurs with or without tumour association, and responds to treatment but can relapse. The presence of a tumour (usually an ovarian teratoma) is dependent on age, sex, and ethnicity, being more frequent in women older than 18 years, and slightly more predominant in black women than it is in white women. Patients treated with tumour resection and immunotherapy (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange) respond faster to treatment and less frequently need second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide or rituximab, or both) than do patients without a tumour who receive similar initial immunotherapy. More than 75% of all patients have substantial recovery that occurs in inverse order of symptom development and is associated with a decline of antibody titres. Patients' antibodies cause a titre-dependent, reversible decrease of synaptic NMDAR by a mechanism of crosslinking and internalisation. On the basis of models of pharmacological or genetic disruption of NMDAR, these antibody effects reveal a probable pathogenic relation between the depletion of receptors and the clinical features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.",

None had ophthalmoplegia. Scoliosis and respiratory insufficiency typically developed early and progressed rapidly, whereas limb weakness was often slowly progressive, and usually did not prevent independent walking.

Oncology,"<h4>Background</h4>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have substantially improved clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types and are increasingly being used in early disease settings and in combinations of different immunotherapies. However, ICIs can also cause severe or fatal immune-related adverse-events (irAEs). We aimed to identify and characterise cardiovascular irAEs that are significantly associated with ICIs.<h4>Methods</h4>In this observational, retrospective, pharmacovigilance study, we used VigiBase, WHO's global database of individual case safety reports, to compare cardiovascular adverse event reporting in patients who received ICIs (ICI subgroup) with this reporting in the full database. This study included all cardiovascular irAEs classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, between inception on Nov 14, 1967, and Jan 2, 2018. We evaluated the association between ICIs and cardiovascular adverse events using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the information component (IC). IC is an indicator value for disproportionate Bayesian reporting that compares observed and expected values to find associations between drugs and adverse events. IC<sub>025</sub> is the lower end of the IC 95% credibility interval, and an IC<sub>025</sub> value of more than zero is deemed significant. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03387540.<h4>Findings</h4>We identified 31 321 adverse events reported in patients who received ICIs and 16 343 451 adverse events reported in patients treated with any drugs (full database) in VigiBase. Compared with the full database, ICI treatment was associated with higher reporting of myocarditis (5515 reports for the full database vs 122 for ICIs, ROR 11·21 [95% CI 9·36-13·43]; IC<sub>025</sub> 3·20), pericardial diseases (12 800 vs 95, 3·80 [3·08-4·62]; IC<sub>025</sub> 1·63), and vasculitis (33 289 vs 82, 1·56 [1·25-1·94]; IC<sub>025</sub> 0·03), including temporal arteritis (696 vs 18, 12·99 [8·12-20·77]; IC<sub>025</sub> 2·59) and polymyalgia rheumatica (1709 vs 16, 5·13 [3·13-8·40]; IC<sub>025</sub> 1·33). Pericardial diseases were reported more often in patients with lung cancer (49 [56%] of 87 patients), whereas myocarditis (42 [41%] of 103 patients) and vasculitis (42 [60%] of 70 patients) were more commonly reported in patients with melanoma (χ<sup>2</sup> test for overall subgroup comparison, p<0·0001). Vision was impaired in five (28%) of 18 patients with temporal arteritis. Cardiovascular irAEs were severe in the majority of cases (>80%), with death occurring in 61 (50%) of 122 myocarditis cases, 20 (21%) of 95 pericardial disease cases, and five (6%) of 82 vasculitis cases (χ<sup>2</sup> test for overall comparison between pericardial diseases, myocarditis, and vasculitis, p<0·0001).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Treatment with ICIs can lead to severe and disabling inflammatory cardiovascular irAEs soon after commencement of therapy. In addition to life-threatening myocarditis, these toxicities include pericardial diseases and temporal arteritis with a risk of blindness.

Since patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection present coagulation and immune system dysregulation, ischemic or haemorragic stroke is not uncommon, irrespective of respiratory distress. However, the occurrence of focal neurological deficits together with other symptoms like headache, cortical blindness, seizure and altered mental status should prompt the diagnosis of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Antithrombotic treatment, the alteration of endothelial function, and coagulopathy due to COVID-19 and PRES leading to the breakdown of blood-brain barrier may then contribute to the occurrence of a brain haemorrhage.<h4>Methods</h4>We describe the case of a COVID-19 patient who developed bilateral occipital lobe haemorrhages suggestive of haemorrhagic PRES. We then reviewed the available literature about haemorrhagic evolution of PRES in COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>We describe the clinical and radiological features of five COVID-19 patients who developed haemorrhagic PRES.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction resulting from the massive release of cytokines during the host immune response may be key factors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related PRES. Antithrombotic therapy and the leakage of the blood-brain barrier can subsequently increase the risk of haemorrhagic transformation of the lesioned brain tissue.

Breast cancer consists of a group of biologically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases originated from the breast. While the risk factors associated with this cancer varies with respect to other cancers, genetic predisposition, most notably mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> gene, is an important causative factor for this malignancy. Breast cancers can begin in different areas of the breast, such as the ducts, the lobules, or the tissue in between. Within the large group of diverse breast carcinomas, there are various denoted types of breast cancer based on their invasiveness relative to the primary tumor sites. It is important to distinguish between the various subtypes because they have different prognoses and treatment implications. As there are remarkable parallels between normal development and breast cancer progression at the molecular level, it has been postulated that breast cancer may be derived from mammary cancer stem cells. Normal breast development and mammary stem cells are regulated by several signaling pathways, such as estrogen receptors (ERs), HER2, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, which control stem cell proliferation, cell death, cell differentiation, and cell motility. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that epigenetic regulations and noncoding RNAs may play important roles in breast cancer development and may contribute to the heterogeneity and metastatic aspects of breast cancer, especially for triple-negative breast cancer. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the molecular, cellular and genetic aspects of breast cancer.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6147049?pdf=render

The ratio of male to female patients was 1.7:1, and the mean age of the patients was 5 years and 5 months. The most common symptoms were cough, fever, and sputum. Anorexia was the most common gastrointestinal symptom, followed by nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Mean levels of AST and ALT were 100.65 IU/L and 118.73 IU/L, respectively. Serum AST/ALT level was normalized within 7.5 days on average without complications. The mean duration of hospitalization (11.3 days) was longer for children with hepatitis than for those without hepatitis (P=0.034).<h4>Conclusion</h4>MP-associated hepatitis is not uncommon and has a relatively good prognosis. Therefore, clinicians should be concerned about liver involvement in MP infection but avoid further unnecessary evaluation of hepatitis associated with MP.",http://www.e-cep.org/upload/pdf/kjped-58-211.pdf

These kinds of injuries require prompt surgical intervention with surgical debridement of all ischemic tissue. Possibility of a general intoxication by the fluid must always be ruled out. Postoperative intensive physiotherapy is essential for the final hand function. The initial benign aspect is frequently causing a delay for an adequate treatment while in the mean time the possibility for subcutaneous damage continuously increases. Because of this delay the chance of permanent reduced functionality in the hand or finger amputation raises. Not only the latency time to adequate treatment but also the injected fluid's nature, the pressure, the volume and the location of injection, has influence on the seriousness and extensiveness of subcutaneous damage. All these factors influence the functional outcome of the patient.",

However, the sample size of patients with scores of 1 or more, captured by the CCI, did not exceed 35%. Further, some comorbidities were rarely found among patients who underwent HCT. Therefore, the current study was designed to (1) better define previously identified comorbidities using pretransplant laboratory data, (2) investigate additional HCT-related comorbidities, and (3) establish comorbidity scores that were suited for HCT. Data were collected from 1055 patients, and then randomly divided into training and validation sets. Weights were assigned to individual comorbidities according to their prognostic significance in Cox proportional hazard models. The new index was then validated. The new index proved to be more sensitive than the CCI since it captured 62% of patients with scores more than 0 compared with 12%, respectively. Further, the new index showed better survival prediction than the CCI (likelihood ratio of 23.7 versus 7.1 and c statistics of 0.661 versus 0.561, respectively, P < .001). In conclusion, the new simple index provided valid and reliable scoring of pretransplant comorbidities that predicted nonrelapse mortality and survival.

It has been speculated that MCCs express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), but this has never been assessed in a large series of MCCs. The main aim of this study was to assess the expression of SSTR2A and SSTR5 in MCC tumours. The secondary aims were to assess whether expression of SSTR was associated with the Ki67 proliferative index, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) status, clinical characteristics and outcome.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data and tumours were collected from an ongoing cohort of French patients with MCC. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-SSTR2A and anti-SSTR5 monoclonal antibodies, and tumours were classified into 3 groups: 'no expression', 'low expression' and 'moderate expression' using an SSTR staining score.<h4>Results</h4>SSTR expression was assessed for 105 MCC tissue samples from 98 patients, and clinical characteristics were available for 87 of them. SSTR expression was consistent between the primary skin tumour and the corresponding metastases for SSTR2A and SSTR5 in 3/7 and 6/7 cases, respectively. SSTR2A and SSTR5 were expressed in 58 cases (59.2%) and in 44 cases (44.9%), respectively. Overall, at least one SSTR was expressed in 75 tumours (76.5%). SSTR expression was not associated with clinical characteristics, Ki67 proliferative index, recurrence-free survival or MCC-specific survival. Expression of SSTR2A was associated with MCPyV status in MCC tumours but not SSTR5.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SSTRs were expressed in a high proportion of MCCs, although expression was heterogeneous between tumours and was not associated with disease severity.",

No data on self-harm in French-speaking Switzerland exist. To address this deficiency, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health commissioned a specific self-harm monitoring programme. We present and discuss its implementation and first findings.<h4>Methods</h4>Every patient aged 18&ndash;65 years presenting for self-harm to the emergency departments of the Lausanne and Neuch&acirc;tel general hospitals were included in the monitoring programme over a 10-month period (December 2016 to September 2017). Clinicians collected anonymous sociodemographic and clinical data.<h4>Results</h4>The sample included 490 patients (54.9% female and 45.1% male) for 554 episodes of self-harm, showing a higher proportion of patients aged 18&ndash;34 (49.2%) than older age groups (35&ndash;49, 33.7% and 50&ndash;65, 17.1%). Patients were mostly single (56.1%) and in problematic socioeconomic situations (65.7%). Self-poisoning was the most commonly used method (58.2%) and was preferred by women (71% of females and 42.5% of males, Fisher&rsquo;s exact test, p &lt;0.001) and the majority of patients (53.3%) had experienced at least one previous episode of self-harm. The self-harm rate was 220 per 100,000 inhabitants in Lausanne and 140 in Neuch&acirc;tel. Suicidal intent was clear for 50.6% of the overall sample, unclear for 25.1% and absent for 24.3%. It differed significantly between sites (&chi;2(2) = 9.068, p = 0.011) as Lausanne reported more incidents of unclear intent (27.7% versus 17.4% in Neuch&acirc;tel) and Neuch&acirc;tel more incidents with absence of intent (33.1% versus 21.3% in Lausanne). In Lausanne, patients more frequently resorted to methods such as jumping from a height (11.4%) and hanging (9%) than in Neuch&acirc;tel (1.6% and 4.9%, Fisher&rsquo;s exact test, p = 0.006).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results are globally consistent with previous research on self-harm. We found significant inter-site differences in methods, suicidal intent and self-harm rates. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing local self-harm monitoring to identify specific at-risk groups and develop targeted preventive intervention.",

It has been suggested that enteric pathogen co-infections play an important role in gastroenteritis, but most research efforts have only focused on a small range of species belonging to a few pathogen groups. This study aimed to assess the impact of co-infections with a broad range of enteric pathogens on children aged below five years who suffer from acute diarrhea in southwest China.<h4>Method</h4>A total of 1020 subjects (850 diarrhea cases and 170 healthy controls) were selected from four sentinel hospitals in Kunming, Yunnan province, southwest China, from June 2014 to July 2015. Stool specimens were collected to detect five virus (rotavirus group A, RVA; norovirus, NoV; Sapovirus, SaV; astrovirus, As; and adenovirus, Ad), seven bacterial (diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, DEC; non-typhoidal Salmonella, NTS; Shigella spp.; Vibrio cholera; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Aeromonas spp.; and Plesiomonas spp.), and three protozoan (Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, and Blastocystis hominis, B. hominis) species using standard microbiologic and molecular methods. Data were analyzed using the partial least square regression technique and chi-square test.<h4>Results</h4>At least one enteric pathogen was detected in 46.7 % (n = 397) of acute gastroenteritis cases and 13.5 % (n = 23) of healthy controls (χ(2) = 64.4, P < 0.05). Single infection with RVA was associated with acute diarrhea (26.5 % vs. 5.8 %, P < 0.05). The prevalence of a single infection with B. hominis in diarrhea cases was higher than in healthy controls (3.1 % vs. 0.5 %, OR = 4.7, 95 % CI: 1.01-112.0). Single infection with NoV GII was not associated with diarrhea (4.4 % vs. 3.5 %, OR = 1.2, 95 % CI: 0.5-3.3). Single infections with bacterial species were not observed. The prevalence of co-infections with two enteric pathogens in diarrhea cases was higher than in asymptomatic children (20.1 % vs. 5.3 %, P < 0.05). RVA-NoV GII was the most common co-infection in symptomatic children (4.4 %), with it aggravating the severity of diarrhea.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although it is clear that RVA has an overwhelming impact on diarrhea illnesses in children, co-infection with other enteric pathogens appears to also aggravate diarrhea severity. These findings should serve as evidence for public health services when planning and developing intervention programs.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4922062?pdf=render

Recent research has offered insight into potential differences between oral corticosteroid and intravenous corticosteroid treatment regimens in terms of efficacy and side-effect profiles, which proved more favorable for the latter. The use of some traditional immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate and mycophenolate, seems suitable as steroid-sparing medications. In recent years, many scientific reports demonstrated the effectiveness of biologic immunosuppressive agents in the management of TED. Etanercept, adalimumab, and tocilizumab have been shown to be effective in reduction of the inflammatory signs with the possible added advantage of preventing relapse of the disease. Teprotumumab may control the disease activity, and it seems to be very effective in preventing disease progression. Infliximab might be useful in severe TED resistant to steroids and orbital decompression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Steroid therapy remains the first-line therapy for moderate/severe and severe vision-threatening TED. The biological agents may provide a deep and long-standing block of inflammatory activity in TED, with the hope to lower the risk of recurrences and to reduce the need of surgical intervention in moderate-to-severe disease. Indeed, the actual incidence of adverse effects is not yet well assessed because of the paucity of studies. Therefore, their use should be limited to those cases that really need an alternative therapy to steroids, handled by expert physician in this field.",

Based on lesion data, a right hemisphere superiority for cerebral processing of emotional prosody has been assumed. However, the available clinical studies do not yet provide a coherent picture with respect to interhemispheric lateralization effects of prosody recognition and intrahemispheric localization of the respective brain regions. To further delineate the cerebral network engaged in the perception of emotional tone, a series of experiments was carried out based upon functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The findings obtained from these investigations allow for the separation of three successive processing stages during recognition of emotional prosody: (1) extraction of suprasegmental acoustic information predominantly subserved by right-sided primary and higher order acoustic regions; (2) representation of meaningful suprasegmental acoustic sequences within posterior aspects of the right superior temporal sulcus; (3) explicit evaluation of emotional prosody at the level of the bilateral inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, implicit processing of affective intonation seems to be bound to subcortical regions mediating automatic induction of specific emotional reactions such as activation of the amygdala in response to fearful stimuli. As concerns lower level processing of the underlying suprasegmental acoustic cues, linguistic and emotional prosody seem to share the same right hemisphere neural resources. Explicit judgment of linguistic aspects of speech prosody, however, appears to be linked to left-sided language areas whereas bilateral orbitofrontal cortex has been found involved in explicit evaluation of emotional prosody. These differences in hemispheric lateralization effects might explain that specific impairments in nonverbal emotional communication subsequent to focal brain lesions are relatively rare clinical observations as compared to the more frequent aphasic disorders.",

Past suicide attempters, in turn, performed worse than depressed non-attempters on attention and memory/working memory tasks [a computerized Stroop task, the Buschke Selective Reminding Task (SRT), the Benton Visual Retention Test (VRT) and an N-back task] but not on other executive function measures, including a task associated with ventral prefrontal function (Object Alternation). Deficits were not accounted for by current suicidal ideation or the lethality of past attempts.

Given that tics as motor phenomena are the defining and cardinal feature of Tourette syndrome, it has long been conceptualized as a motor/movement disorder. However, considering premonitory urges preceding tics, hypersensitivity to external stimuli and abnormalities in sensorimotor integration perceptual processes also seem to be relevant in the pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome. In addition, tic expression depends on attention and tics can, at least partly and transiently, be controlled, so that cognitive processes need to be considered as well. Against this background, explanatory concepts should encompass not only the motor phenomenon tic but also perceptual and cognitive processes. Representing a comprehensive theory of the processing of perceptions and actions paying particular attention to their interdependency and the role of cognitive control, the Theory of Event Coding seems to be a suitable conceptual framework for the understanding of Tourette syndrome. In fact, recent data suggests that addressing the relation between actions (i.e., tics) and perceptions (i.e., sensory phenomena like premonitory urges) in the context of event coding allows to gaining relevant insights into perception-action coding in Tourette syndrome indicating that perception action binding is abnormally strong in this disorder.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.597898/pdf

The tool was administered to 34 children (19 males, 15 females, mean age 8y 2mo, range 2y 5mo-18y 7mo) with hypertonia and cerebral palsy (CP) in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels: I, n=7; II, n=5; III, n=7 level IV, n=7; and level V, n=8 level. Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 determined internal consistency. To assess reliability, two physicians administered the tool to 25 additional children with CP (15 males, 10 females; mean age 10y 8 mo; GMFCS levels I, n=4; II, n=3; III, n=7; IV, n=4; and V, n=7) on two occasions, 2 weeks apart. To evaluate validity, a third physician diagnosed the hypertonia by neurological examination.<h4>Results</h4>The internal consistency of the spasticity items was moderate (alpha = 0.58), and dystonia was high (a=0.79). Item reduction eliminated seven of the 14 original items. The agreement of the spasticity and rigidity subscales was adequate (prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa [PABAK] ranging from moderate [0.57] to excellent [1.0]) for validity, test-retest reliability, and interrater reliability. For dystonia agreement was lower, with PABAK ranging from fair (0.30) to good (0.65). Eighty-seven per cent had spasticity and 78% had dystonia.<h4>Interpretation</h4>The Hypertonia Assessment Tool has good reliability and validity for identifying spasticity and the absence of rigidity, and moderate findings for dystonia.",

In the present study the prevalence of ATD and the clinical presentation at TE onset in a cohort of paediatric index cases are reported. In 319 unselected paediatric patients (0.1-18 years) from 313 families, recruited between July 1996 and December 2013, a comprehensive thrombophilia screening was performed along with recording of anamnestic data. 21 of 319 paediatric patients (6.6%), corresponding to 16 of 313 families (5.1%), were AT-deficient with confirmed underlying AT gene mutations. Mean age at first TE onset was 14 years (range 0.1 to 17). Thrombotic locations were renal veins (n=2), cerebral veins (n=5), deep veins (DVT) of the leg (n=9), DVT & pulmonary embolism (n=4) and pelvic veins (n=1). ATD co-occurred with the factor-V-Leiden mutation in one and the prothrombin G20210A mutation in two children. In 57.2% of patients a concomitant risk factor for TE was identified, whereas 42.8% of patients developed TE spontaneously. A second TE event within primarily healthy siblings occurred in three of 313 families and a third event among siblings was observed in one family. In an unselected cohort of paediatric patients with symptomatic TE, the prevalence of ATD adjusted for family status was 5.1%. Given its clinical implication for patients and family members, thrombophilia testing should be performed and the benefit of medical or educational interventions should be evaluated in this high risk population.",

The study of antithrombin deficiency has generated excellent, and in some cases, surprising results that may be extrapolated to other thrombophilia and genetic disorders. Routine diagnosis of antithrombin deficiency is based on functional assays. Few specialized laboratories also perform genetic analysis, even though nowadays it is a simple, fast and cheap process that generates relevant information with clinical usefulness. Molecular analysis of SERPINC1, the gene encoding antithrombin, has been restricted so far to cases with confirmed or familial antithrombin deficiency. However, some pathogenic mutations are not detected by current functional methods and other gene defects may have functional consequences only observed under specific conditions. Thus, molecular analysis may be the best method to identify antithrombin deficiency. Up to 80% of patients with antithrombin deficiency have SERPINC1 gene defects, mostly (90% of the 315 gene defects described so far) point mutations or small deletions or insertions affecting the 7 exons or flanking regions. The description of new SERPINC1 gene defects may reveal new residues with functional or structural relevance and new mechanisms causing deficiency of this endogenous anticoagulant. Moreover, other genes and mechanisms may also be involved in antithrombin deficiency. Thus, disorders of N-glycosylation explain up to 5% of cases with antithrombin deficiency. However, there are still up to 10-15% of cases with antithrombin deficiency of unknown cause, whose study may reveal new genes and mechanisms involved in thrombosis.",

The onset is mainly in childhood and the symptoms can either fade away or require pharmacological therapies associated with cognitive-behavior therapies. In rare cases, patients experience severe and disabling symptoms refractory to conventional treatments. In these cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be considered as an interesting and effective option for symptomatic control. DBS has been studied in numerous trials as a therapy for movement disorders, and currently positive data supports that DBS is partially effective in reducing the motor and non-motor symptoms of TS. The average response, mostly from case series and prospective cohorts and only a few controlled studies, is around 40% improvement on tic severity scales. The ventromedial thalamus has been the preferred target, but more recently the globus pallidus internus has also gained some notoriety. The mechanism by which DBS is effective on tics and other symptoms in TS is not yet understood. As refractory TS is not common, even reference centers have difficulties in performing large controlled trials. However, studies that reproduce the current results in larger and multicenter randomized controlled trials to improve our knowledge so as to support the best target and stimulation settings are still lacking. This article will discuss the selection of the candidates, DBS targets and mechanisms on TS, and clinical evidence to date reviewing current literature about the use of DBS in the treatment of TS.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=49419

Multivariate-adjusted OS of LCNEC patients resembled that of SCLC patients, and was poorer than those of SqCC and AdC patients. However, frequency of surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy resembled SqCC and AdC more than SCLC.Diagnosis of LCNEC has increased in recent years. The metastatic pattern of LCNEC resembles SCLC as does the OS. However, early-stage treatment strategies seem more comparable to those of SqCC and AdC.",

It comprises a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Sensitive and specific diagnostic tests such as cell-based assay are primordial for the detection of neuronal cell surface antibodies in patients' cerebrospinal fluid or serum and determine the treatment and follow-up of the patients. As neurological symptoms are fairly well described in the literature, this review focuses on the nature of psychiatric symptoms occurring at the onset or during the course of the diseases. In order to help the diagnosis, the main neurological symptoms of the most representative synaptic and neuronal cell surface autoantibodies were detailed. Finally, the exploration of these autoantibodies for almost a decade allowed us to present an overview of autoimmune encephalitis incidence in psychiatric disease and the general guidelines for the management of psychiatric manifestations. For the majority of autoimmune encephalitis, the prognosis depends on the rapidity of the detection, identification, and the management of the disease. Because the presence of pronounced psychiatric symptoms drives patients to psychiatric institutions and can hinder the diagnosis, the aim of this work is to provide clues to help earlier detection by physicians and thus provide better medical care to patients.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=33253

Despite dose adjustment for renal failure, diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV are at risk for rapid decline in renal function by whatever reason, so that MF toxicity might arise if the drug is not timely withdrawn. Sixteen consecutive patients were admitted to our Hospital's Emergency Department with clinical findings consistent with MALA. Fifteen had prior history of CKD, 60 % of them with GFR between 30 and 60 ml/min. Of these, 5 required mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular support; 3 promptly recovered renal function after rehydration, whereas 10 (62 %) required continuous veno-venous renal replacement treatment. SOFA and SAPS II scores were significantly related to the degree of lactic acidosis. In addition, lactate levels were relevant to therapeutic choices, since they were higher in dialyzed patients than in those on conservative treatment (11.92 mmol/l vs 5.7 mmol/l, p = 0.03). The overall death rate has been 31 %, with poorer prognosis for worse acidemia, as serum pH was significantly lower in non-survivors (pH 6.96 vs 7.16, p > 0.04). Our own data and a review of the literature suggest that aged, hemodynamically frail patients, with several comorbidities and CKD, are at greater risk of MALA, despite MF dosage adjustment. Moreover, renal replacement therapy rather than simple acidosis correction by administration of alkali seems the treatment of choice, based on eventual renal recovery and overall outcome.",

Ninety-five percent of people with VS present with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL); the mechanism of this SNHL is currently unknown. To establish the first model to study the role of VS-secreted factors in causing SNHL, murine cochlear explant cultures were treated with human tumour secretions from thirteen different unilateral, sporadic VSs of subjects demonstrating varied degrees of ipsilateral SNHL. The extent of cochlear explant damage due to secretion application roughly correlated with the subjects' degree of SNHL. Secretions from tumours associated with most substantial SNHL resulted in most significant hair cell loss and neuronal fibre disorganization. Secretions from VSs associated with good hearing or from healthy human nerves led to either no effect or solely fibre disorganization. Our results are the first to demonstrate that secreted factors from VSs can lead to cochlear damage. Further, we identified tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) as an ototoxic molecule and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) as an otoprotective molecule in VS secretions. Antibody-mediated TNFα neutralization in VS secretions partially prevented hair cell loss due to the secretions. Taken together, we have identified a new mechanism responsible for SNHL due to VSs.",https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18599.pdf

The rarity and severity of Lemierre's syndrome has made it an attractive subject for case reports but there is a paucity of evidence to inform areas of persistent uncertainty. In recent years, heightened attention and controversy has focused upon speculation that a purported rise in the incidence of Lemierre's syndrome is due to reduced antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections, that F. necrophorum is an under-appreciated cause of acute tonsillopharyngitis and that testing and targeted treatment would prevent cases of Lemierre's syndrome.",

This prompted us to investigate the correlation between semiquantitative CD30 protein assessment by IHC and messenger RNA (mRNA) assessment by microarrays in a cohort of 376 noncutaneous PTCLs representative of the main entities. By IHC, CD30 expression was heterogeneous across and within entities and significantly associated with large tumor cell size. In addition to 100% anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, 57% of other PTCL entities were CD30-positive at a 5% threshold. CD30 protein expression was highly correlated to mRNA levels. mRNA levels were bimodal, separating high from low CD30-expressing PTCL cases.

There is an association between CRC and endometrial cancer (EC). Up to 10% of this linkage may be due to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer but in the majority of patients a genetic disorder is not found. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on CRC since 2005 have suggested that women with endometrial or ovarian cancer diagnosed at less than 60 years of age have CRC screening with colonoscopy beginning at age 40 or at time of diagnosis of the gynecologic tumor. We assessed our population of women with EC to determine if women were receiving CRC screening after a diagnosis of EC.<h4>Methods</h4>Electronic medical records of all women diagnosed at our institution with EC predominantly between 1997 and 2007 were reviewed. We assessed age at diagnosis, tumor type, family history of malignancy, CRC screening, and findings at CRC screening and recorded the information in a database. Patients were evaluated for the Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred sixty-seven women with EC were evaluated. The median age was 66; 39% were less than age 60 at diagnosis. Family history of CRC was present in 25 (9.4%) of EC patients. Of these women, 125 (46.8%) had CRC screening, with 12 (9.6%) being screened for CRC within 1 year of diagnosis and 33 (26.4%) screened for CRC before diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Of the women, 142 (53.2%) did not have CRC screening reported. Of the women screened, ten had adenomatous polyps with one of those polyps being greater than 1 cm, four had tubulovillous histology, and three had CRC. Colonoscopy was performed in 59.2% of women who underwent CRC screening. One woman met criteria for Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Less than half of women with EC received screening for CRC. Women who were screened had significant pathology in 13.6% of cases and 2.4% had colon cancer. The NCCN guidelines should be more aggressively followed by physicians who care for women. A prospective colonoscopy screening study on these women with EC to assess the yield and utility in screening in this population is needed.",

These fusions typically occur mutually exclusively of one another and other well-known initiating mutations such as BRAF, NRAS, NF1, KIT, and GNAQ. Fusions are found in over 50% of Spitz neoplasms, including ALK, BRAF, NTRK1, NTRK3, ROS1, MET, MAP3K8, and RET. Familiarity with the typical morphologic features of certain fusion-driven melanocytic neoplasms can help with classification, diagnosis, and identification of targeted molecular therapies in malignant cases. Spitz tumors with ALK, NTRK1, and NTRK3 fusions have characteristic morphologic features. BRAF and MAP3K8 fusions, in particular, tend to be epithelioid, high grade, and more frequent in Spitz melanoma than other fusion subtypes. Sporadic cases of pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma may have PRKCA fusions and sheets of monomorphic epithelioid melanocytes. Fusion events are also enriched among melanomas without the key mutations BRAF, NRAS, or NF1. Although NGS is the most reliable method to detect fusions, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization are cost-effective alternatives in some cases. We describe recent discoveries regarding the role of kinase fusions in melanocytic neoplasms and their associated morphologies.",

Thrombotic risk is thought to vary according to the subtype of deficiency, with Heparin Binding Site (HBS) deficiencies being the less thrombogenic.<h4>Objectives and methods</h4>The study population consisted of 82 genetically confirmed HBS deficient patients sharing six different mutations. Plasma samples of 35 of them, including one homozygous patient, were used for the evaluation of 4 commercial activity assays in their ability to diagnose HBS deficiency. We assessed mutation-specific prevalence of venous and arterial thrombosis and the contribution of additional thrombophilic risk factors.<h4>Results and conclusions</h4>Only one assay showed 100% sensitivity for all HBS mutations. The other ones failed mainly in the cases with p.Pro73Leu and p.Arg79His mutations. Shortening of incubation time resulted in an increase in sensitivity. In one patient, a novel HBS mutation, p.Asn77His, was identified, a quite exceptional and important finding given the restricted number of causal mutations reported so far in AT HBS deficiency. The overall prevalence of VTE in our study population (35%) was higher than previously reported (6-8%) in these patients. The presence of additional thrombophilic risk factors such as Factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation G20210A contributed to a higher risk of VTE. Interestingly, the p.Pro73Leu and p.Arg79His mutations were associated with a high prevalence of arterial thrombosis. Our data suggest that AT HBS deficiencies are probably more prevalent and less benign than previously assumed.",

We aimed to contribute to fill this gap in investigating the relationship between personality as conceptualized by the Five-Factor Model, the IPTS constructs, and a dimensional measure of current suicidal ideation. We conducted correlation, multiple linear regression, and path analyses based on a trait-interpersonal framework in a sample of 201 individuals visiting the psychiatric emergency room of a general hospital with current suicidal ideation. Neuroticism (positively) and openness (negatively) predicted perceived burdensomeness, while neuroticism (positively) and extraversion (negatively) predicted thwarted belongingness. Higher conscientiousness and lower extraversion were both predictors of the acquired capability for suicide. However, none of the models involving path analyses with IPTS variables as mediators of the relationship between personality traits and suicidal ideation was adequately adjusted to the data. Thus, it appears that personality plays a significant albeit modest role in suicidality when considered from an IPTS perspective. As personality is frequently assessed in the clinical routine, health professionals should consider it as complementary to detect individuals at risk of or presenting suicidal ideation.",https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/4/636/pdf?version=1525345937

The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of 3D-CTA for patients with unruptured internal carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysms. We pre-operatively obtained surgical simulation images using 3D-CTA and 3D reconstruction and then compared them with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), conventional cerebral angiography and operative findings in the patients. Two patients with unruptured internal carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm were selected. These patients underwent direct neck clipping after the optic canal was unroofed through a combined epidural-subdural approach. The cerebral aneurysm was detected by 3D-CTA, MRA and conventional cerebral angiography in each case. Only by 3D-CTA, however, could we easily detect the relationships among the aneurysm neck, ophthalmic artery and optic canal. Based on this information, direct clipping operations were performed safely without any complications. 3D-CTA is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic method not only for detecting cerebral aneurysms, but also for evaluating the relationships between the aneurysms and surrounding structures.",

Increasing evidence suggests that stroke confers substantial risk for suicide and following a stroke, patients frequently develop poststroke depression, which is a well-established risk factor for suicide. In this overview of the current literature, we examined the association between suffering a stroke and subsequent risk for suicide and suicidal ideation. We performed a careful MedLine, Excerpta Medica, PsycLit, PsycInfo, and Index Medicus search to identify all articles and book chapters in English. We initially selected 31 articles published between 1990 and 2011; however, only 16 studies were included in this review. All articles identified stroke as a significant risk factor for suicide, especially among depressed patients, providing further support for poststroke depression and suicidality. The results also indicated that there were differences between patients who developed acute-onset suicidal plans and those who reported delayed-onset plans, which occurred more frequently. Many of the stroke patients who died by suicide suffered from depression prior to their death, suggesting that being diagnosed with a mood disorder contributes to an increased risk of suicide in this population. Suffering from a stroke increases the risk of dying by suicide and developing suicidal ideation, particularly in young adults and women. The factors found to confer the most risk for suicidality were depression, previous mood disorder, prior history of stroke, and cognitive impairment.",

Moreover, the dynamics of the disease requires further explanation, mainly concerning the transmission of the virus from humans to animals and vice versa. Therefore, this study aimed to gather information about the reported cases of COVID-19 transmission in animals through a literary review of works published in scientific journals and perform genomic and phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animal hosts. Although many instances of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, caution and further studies are necessary to avoid the occurrence of maltreatment in animals, and to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of the disease in the environment, humans, and animals.

The small echogenic lesion was easily detectable within the ureter lumen. A second patient, presenting with suprapubic pain, urgency and back pain, was also diagnosed with a ureteral calculus and additionally a hydroureter. The presence of a hydroureter is part of the differential diagnosis of any cystic structure in the pelvis. In a third case, an elderly woman, referred with uterine prolapse, transvaginal ultrasound examination showed a tubular anechoic structure lateral in the pelvis due to a hydroureter, illustrating the differential diagnosis with a hydrosalpinx. A fourth patient, presenting with hematuria, showed an irregular and highly vascularized mass in the bladder and was diagnosed with a transitional cell carcinoma.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The bladder and pelvic part of the ureters are easily identifiable on transvaginal scan. Important pathology of the lower urinary tract and the distal ureters can be readily diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound examination.

There is not yet definitive EMB/autopsy proof that SARS-CoV-2 causes direct cardiomyocyte damage in association with histological myocarditis. Clinical epidemiology data suggest that myocarditis is uncommon for both SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative PCR cases. We hypothesize that the rare virus-negative biopsy-proven cases may represent new-onset immune-mediated or latent pre-existing autoimmune forms,triggered or fostered by the hyperinflammatory state of severe COVID-19. We recommend the application of the ESC/WHO definitions and diagnostic criteria in future reports to avoid low-quality scientific information leading to an inaccurate estimate of myocarditis incidence based on misdiagnosis.",

This case series discusses the clinical and radiological aspects of one such stroke caused by occlusion of the artery of Percheron (AOP).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Computerized discharge summaries, outpatient records and imaging from picture archiving and communication system (PACS, GE), of patients with AOP infarction over a period of 12-years (2002-2014) were identified and their clinical and radiological features analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Of 3589 strokes (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), 17 (0.47%) were due to AOP infarction. Their mean age was 50 years (range: 31-72 years). Disorders of consciousness (94%) were the most common presenting symptoms followed by gaze (53%) and memory impairment (24%). At follow-up, 2/17 (12%) patients developed extrapyramidal features. All patients had bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Associated anterior thalamic (5/17; 30%) and mid brain (10/17; 59%) infarcts were also seen. CT scan done in 11/17 patients prior to the MRI picked up only 6/11 (55%) of these infarcts. The most common etiological factors detected using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria were cardio embolic (8/17; 47%) followed by small vessel occlusion (7/17; 41%). Mortality occurred in 2/17 (12%) patients. At 6 months, a modified Rankin score of 2 or less was seen in 8/17 (47%) patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Artery of Percheron infarcts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with sudden alterations in consciousness.

By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology-""pathogenic,"" ""likely pathogenic,"" ""uncertain significance,"" ""likely benign,"" and ""benign""-to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4544753?pdf=render

Multimodal imaging techniques, including color and red-free photographs, near-infrared reflectance, fluorescein angiography, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, were performed in all eyes, and the findings were correlated with microperimetry in two eyes. Imaging findings in DCI were compared with those of a cotton wool spot caused by superficial capillary ischemia (SCI).<h4>Results</h4>Unlike SCI, the imaging findings in DCI were subtler during both the acute and chronic phase, but specific optical coherence tomographic findings could readily differentiate these entities. Acute SCI showed inner retinal whitening, edema, and increased reflectivity, whereas acute DCI showed increased reflectivity of middle retinal layers. Chronic DCI showed retinal thinning with middle layer atrophy, whereas chronic SCI showed inner layer atrophy. In one patient, microperimetry showed a paracentral dense scotoma that corresponded well to the optical coherence tomographic findings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Deep capillary ischemia may represent a nonspecific finding of retinal ischemia and produces characteristic changes within the middle retinal layers, analogous to a deep cotton wool spot, but with distinct features differing from the superficial cotton wool spot which is seen in SCI. Among the various multimodal imaging techniques, optical coherence tomography seemed to be the most sensitive and specific technique in detecting DCI in both the acute and chronic phases.",

Due to limited evidence in this area, we conducted the first systematic literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate outcomes associated with the use of ICE.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Studies reporting the use of ICE during ablation procedures vs without ICE were searched using PubMed/MEDLINE. A meta-analysis was performed on the 19 studies (2186 patients) meeting inclusion criteria, collectively representing a broad range of arrhythmia mechanisms. Use of ICE was associated with significant reductions in fluoroscopy time (Hedges' g -1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.81 to -0.32; P < .01), fluoroscopy dose (Hedges' g -1.27; 95% CI -1.91 to -0.62; P < .01), and procedure time (Hedges' g -0.35; 95% CI -0.64 to -0.05; P = .02) vs ablation without ICE. A 6.95 minute reduction in fluoroscopy time and a 15.2 minute reduction in procedure time was observed between the ICE vs non-ICE groups. These efficiency gains were not associated with any decreased effectiveness or safety. Sensitivity analyses limiting studies to an atrial fibrillation (AF) only population yielded similar results to the main analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of ICE in the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias is associated with significantly lower fluoroscopy time, fluoroscopy dose, and shorter procedure time vs ablation without ICE.

Two forms of PHA1 exist. An autosomal recessive form features severe disease with manifestations persisting into adulthood. This form is caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding subunits of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC; refs 2,3). Autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1 is a milder disease that remits with age. Among six dominant and seven sporadic PHA1 kindreds, we have found no ENaC gene mutations, implicating mutations in other genes. As ENaC activity in the kidney is regulated by the steroid hormone aldosterone acting through the mineralocorticoid receptor, we have screened the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (MLR) for variants and have identified heterozygous mutations in one sporadic and four dominant kindreds. These include two frameshift mutations (one a de novo mutation), two premature termination codons and one splice donor mutation. These mutations segregate with PHA1 and are not found in unaffected subjects. These findings demonstrate that heterozygous MLR mutations cause PHA1, underscore the important role of mineralocorticoid receptor function in regulation of salt and blood pressure homeostasis in humans and motivate further study of this gene for a potential role in blood pressure variation.",

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of proper selection of antibiotics for treatment of severe MPP and increase awareness concerning the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant MPP.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>A case of severe life-threatening pneumonia in a 26-year-old man with high fever and cough was non-responsive to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones.<h4>Diagnoses</h4>The patient was diagnosed with MPP based on the test results of bronchoalveolar lavage using real-time quantitative PCR method.<h4>Interventions</h4>Tigecycline was given to the patient after azithromycin and fluoroquinolones failed.<h4>Outcomes</h4>The patients fever subsided within the first day of tigecycline therapy. He showed rapid symptom resolution and improvement in lung infiltration after 4 days of tigecycline therapy.<h4>Lessons</h4>The case suggests that fulminant MPP should be timely treated with proper antibiotics, and the possible emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant MPP should be of concern.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7360219?pdf=render

The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to develop consensus recommendations pertaining to 7 treatment topics. In February 2019, the international panel was reconvened with the addition of one member to represent South America. All previous recommendations were reviewed for currency, and new consensus recommendations were developed on topics that required inclusion or updates based on the recent literature. Up to 3 rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to reach consensus, with modifications to recommendations between rounds based on the panel input. A simple majority vote (80% of panel members voting ""yes"") was used to approve minor changes in grammar and syntax to improve clarity.<h4>Results</h4>The previous recommendations for thymectomy were updated. New recommendations were developed for the use of rituximab, eculizumab, and methotrexate as well as for the following topics: early immunosuppression in ocular MG and MG associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This updated formal consensus guidance of international MG experts, based on new evidence, provides recommendations to clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.",https://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/96/3/114.full.pdf

Surgical treatment is increasingly considered when tics become troublesome or even disabling or self-injurious despite optimal medical therapy. In this review, we describe the surgical techniques, stimulation parameters, outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in TS, and critically review target choices.<h4>Methods</h4>A search of the PubMed database was performed to identify all articles discussing DBS and TS. 'Tourette' and 'Stimulation' were used as MeSH headings.<h4>Results</h4>Since the first report of thalamic DBS for TS in 1999, follow-up on less than 100 patients has been reported in the literature. Reported targets for DBS include the thalamic centromedian nucleus and substantia periventricularis, posteroventral globus pallidus internus, ventromedial globus pallidus internus, globus pallidus externus, anterior limb of the internal capsule and nucleus accumbens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Determination of the optimal surgical target will require a multicenter, randomized trial, and an expanded understanding of the neurobiology of TS.",

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors related to survival and time to development of LMD in breast cancer patients. A retrospective analysis of breast cancer patients with LMD, evaluated in MDACC between 1995 and 2011. 103 patients with diagnosis of breast cancer and LMD were identified (one male). The median age at LMD diagnosis was 49.2 years. 78.2 % had invasive ductal carcinoma. Hormone receptors (HRs) were positive in 55.3 % of patients, 47.4 % were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive and 22.8 % were triple negative. 52 % of the patients were treated with WBRT, 19 % with spinal radiation, 36 % with systemic chemotherapy and 55 % with intrathecal chemotherapy. Estimated median overall survival from time of breast cancer diagnosis was 3.66 years. Median survival from time of LMD diagnosis was 4.2 months. Time from breast cancer diagnosis to LMD was 2.48 years. In multivariate analysis, HR status and stage at diagnosis were significantly associated with time to LMD diagnosis (p < 0.05). In triple negative patients, time to LMD was shorter. In patients who were HR positive, time to LMD was longer. Survival from LMD diagnosis was significantly associated with both treatment, as well as positive HR status (multivariate analysis p < 0.05). In conclusion LMD has dismal prognosis in breast cancer patients. HR status contributes to time to LMD diagnosis and survival from LMD diagnosis. The impact of treatment aimed at LMD cannot be ascertained in our retrospective study due to the inherent bias associated with the decision to treat.",

We aimed at investigating the effect of abdominal acupuncture (AA) on the laser-evoked potential (LEP) amplitude and laser-pain rating to stimulation of body parts either homotopic or heterotopic to the treated acupoint.<h4>Methods</h4>Laser-evoked potentials were recorded from 13 healthy subjects to stimulation of the right wrist (RW), left wrist (LW) and right foot (RF). LEPs were obtained before, during and after the AA stimulation of an abdominal area corresponding to the representation of the RW. Subjective laser-pain rating was collected after each LEP recording.<h4>Results</h4>The amplitude of the N2/P2 LEP component was significantly reduced during AA and 15 min after needle removal to both RW (F = 4.14, p = .02) and LW (F = 5.48, p = .008) stimulation, while the N2/P2 amplitude to RF stimulation (F = 0.94, p = .4) remained unchanged. Laser-pain rating was reduced during AA and 15 min after needle removal only to RW stimulation (F = 5.67, p = .007).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings showing an AA effect on LEP components to both the ipsilateral and contralateral region homotopic to the treated area, without any LEP change to stimulation of a heterotopic region, suggest that the AA analgesia is mediated by a segmental spinal mechanism.<h4>Significance</h4>Although abdominal acupuncture has demonstrated to be effective in the reduction in laser-evoked potential (LEP) amplitude and laser-pain rating, the exact mechanism of this analgesic effect is not known. In the current study, we found that treatment of an area in the ""turtle representation"" of the body led to a topographical pattern of LEP amplitude inhibition that can be mediated by a segmental spinal mechanism.",

Citations were independently screened by 2 authors, and those meeting the inclusion criteria defined a priori were retained. Data on year of publication, study design, country of origin, number of patients/controls, ethnicity, VTE type, and frequency of recurrence were abstracted. Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated, and summary odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated with both fixed-effects and random-effects models. Thirty-five of 50 studies met inclusion criteria. No significant heterogeneity was discerned across studies. Although >70% of patients had at least 1 clinical risk factor for VTE, a statistically significant association with VTE onset was demonstrated for each IT trait evaluated (and for combined IT traits), with summary odds ratios ranging from 2.63 (95% CI, 1.61 to 4.29) for the factor II variant to 9.44 (95% CI, 3.34 to 26.66) for antithrombin deficiency. Furthermore, a significant association with recurrent VTE was found for all IT traits except the factor V variant and elevated lipoprotein(a).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present meta-analysis indicates that detection of IT is clinically meaningful in children with, or at risk for, VTE and underscores the importance of pediatric thrombophilia screening programs.",

While the expression of Sry and Sox9 is sufficient to induce male development, we here show that female differentiation requires activation of the canonical beta-catenin signaling pathway. beta-catenin activation is controlled by Rspo1 in XX gonads and Rspo1 knockout mice show masculinized gonads. Molecular analyses demonstrate an absence of female-specific activation of Wnt4 and as a consequence XY-like vascularization and steroidogenesis. Moreover, germ cells of XX knockout embryos show changes in cellular adhesions and a failure to enter XX specific meiosis. Sex cords develop around birth, when Sox9 becomes strongly activated. Thus, a balance between Sox9 and beta-catenin activation determines the fate of the gonad, with Rspo1 acting as a crucial regulator of canonical beta-catenin signaling required for female development.",

However, only few studies exist regarding this subject. We conducted a mini-review on the possible associations between neurologic language impairment (on the motor, comprehension, and semantic sides) and SI/SB. Based on the literature review, we hypothesized that language impairments exacerbate psychiatric comorbidities, which, in turn, aggravate language impairments. Patients trapped in this vicious cycle can develop SI/SB. The so-called ""affective prosody"" provides some relevant insights concerning the interaction between the different language levels and the world of emotions. This hypothesis is illustrated in a clinical presentation, consisting of the case of a 74-year old woman who was admitted to a psychiatric emergency department (ED) after a failed SA. Having suffered an ischemic stroke two years earlier, she suffered from incomplete Broca's aphasia and dysprosody. She also presented with generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms. We observed that her language impairments were both aggravated by the exacerbations of her anxiety and depressive symptoms. In this patient, who had deficits on the motor side, these exacerbations were triggered by her inability to express herself, her emotional status, and suffering. SI was fluctuant, and-one year after the SA-she completed suicide. Further studies are needed to ascertain possible reciprocal and interacting associations between language impairments, psychiatric comorbidities, and SI/SB. They could enable clinicians to better understand their patient's specific suffering, as brought on by language impairment, and contribute to the refining of suicide risk detection in this sub-group of affected patients.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/12/1594/pdf?version=1638959751

Strategies of history taking and examination techniques are reviewed, followed by a broad overview of the causes of diplopia organized by neuroanatomic localization. Diplopia may be the first symptom of serious vision or life-threatening neurologic disease, and its correct localization and diagnosis are therefore essential. The systems responsible for ocular movement and alignment in the vertical and horizontal plane include complex supranuclear circuitry, brainstem nuclei, cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, and their respective neuromuscular junctions and target muscles. Disruption at any point within this system or within the vestibular afferents that govern eye movement in response to head movements may therefore produce diplopia, leading to a broad differential diagnosis for the patient with diplopia. With a careful history and examination, the neurologist should be able to observe the patterns of diplopia that reveal the site of dysfunction, thus generating a shorter localization-specific list of possible etiologies. Examination of ocular motility including smooth pursuit and saccadic function, followed, if necessary, by testing designed to uncover misalignments of the eyes, including cover and Maddox rod testing, are primary components of the efferent neurologic examination. Further testing designed to detect myasthenia (eg, lid testing and fatigable upgaze) and orbital disease (eg, measuring proptosis, testing for resistance to retropulsion) may be necessary.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Recent advances in the diagnosis of diplopia include the observation that vertical diplopia from skew deviation is more likely to improve with supine positioning than that caused by trochlear nerve palsies. Advances in the field of ocular myasthenia include the observation of decreased conversion to the generalized form with treatment with either steroids or thymectomy, although these conclusions need to be confirmed by prospective, randomized trials. Rarely, pure ocular myasthenia may be associated with the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody.<h4>Summary</h4>With proper skills, the neurologist can elucidate the localization of diplopia, even in cases of complex ocular misalignment, and generate a management plan that can address the underlying disease, and, in many cases, ameliorate or cure the diplopia.",

This study seeks to identify potential clinical and novel indicators of the weight of airway secretions cleared from a single session of chest physiotherapy in mechanically ventilated subjects.<h4>Methods</h4>We recorded airway crackles using artificial airway acoustic sound monitoring and computerized lung-sound amplitude using artificial airway acoustic sound detection and compared them to standard clinical assessments in 71 mechanically ventilated subjects immediately prior to a single session of chest physiotherapy. Correlational analyses were undertaken between the weight of airway secretions obtained after the single session of chest physiotherapy as the dependent variable and novel assessments, clinical assessments, patient characteristics, and ventilator parameters as the independent variables. Multiple linear regression analyses were then used to determine the best model to predict the weight of airway secretions obtained from the single chest physiotherapy session. Data are reported as mean and median as appropriate. Significance was set at <i>P</i> < .05.<h4>Results</h4>71 mechanically ventilated subjects were included for analysis. Statistically significant associations with the weight of airway secretions included the presence of a sawtooth waveform on expiration and the novel assessment of average airway crackles during inspiration. The best predictive model of the weight of airway secretions included the presence of the sawtooth waveform on expiration and ventilator tidal volume.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Simple clinical assessments used in this study were able to independently predict the weight of airway secretions cleared during a single session of chest physiotherapy.

The Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Scale score improved by a mean of 45.7% (range, 11.0%-77.2%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study is currently the largest reported GPi DBS case series of patients with treatment-refractory TS with the longest follow-up. Our results support the potential beneficial effect of GPi DBS on disabling tic reduction and improvement of quality of life.",

This syndrome is strictly related to the spondyloarthopathies (particularly to psoriatic arthritis) and many SaS cases fulfil the classification criteria for the spondyloarthopathies. Because SaS is an uncommon disease, current knowledge regarding its therapy is based on limited experiences gained by treating mainly small groups of patients. As a consequence, its treatment is still empiric. Several drugs (including NSAIDs, corticosteroids, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, ciclosporin, leflunomide, calcitonin and so on) have been administered and obtained conflicting results. The use of antibiotics, due to the isolation of Propionibacterium acnes from the bone biopsies of several subjects with SaS, has not represented a turning point in therapy, although some patients are responsive to this treatment. Initial reports concerning the administration of bisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronic acid) and of an anti-TNF-alpha agent (infliximab) are very promising for the future. In any case, larger, multi-centre, controlled, double-blind studies are required to emerge from the present pioneering phase.",

We evaluated the survival outcomes and incidence of brain recurrence of advanced LCNECs, and compared them with those of a population of SCLCs matched by stage.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Forty-eight unresected stage III HGNECs (16 LCNECs and 32 SCLCs) and 113 stage IV HGNECs (37 LCNECs and 76 SCLCs) were eligible for the analysis. The efficacy of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy with or without thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) and/or prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Overall response was significantly lower for LCNECs compared with SCLCs for both stage III (43.8% vs 90.6% respectively, P=0.004) and stage IV (43.3% vs 64.5%, respectively, P=0.04). Similarly, an inferior outcome was observed in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) for LCNECs compared with SCLCs, which, however, reached significance only for stage III disease (median: 5.6 vs 8.9 months, P=0.06 and 10.4 vs 17.6 months, P=0.03 for PFS and OS, respectively). In the lack of PCI, LCNECs showed a high cumulative incidence of brain metastases, as 58% and 48% of still living stage III and IV patients, respectively, developed brain metastases at 18 months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patients with advanced LCNECs are at high risk for brain recurrence. Unresected stage III LCNECs treated with platinum-etoposide with or without TRT bear a dismal prognosis, when compared indirectly with SCLC counterparts. Randomized trials should evaluate whether PCI could improve survival of advanced LCNECs.",

In this study, two type I FCoVs, three type II FCoVs and ten type II CCoVs were genetically compared. The results showed that three Japanese type II FCoVs, M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627, also emerged by homologous recombination between type I FCoV and type II CCoV and their parent viruses were genetically different from one another. In addition, the 3'-terminal recombination sites of M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 were different from one another within the genes encoding membrane and spike proteins, and the 5'-terminal recombination sites were also located at different regions of ORF1. These results indicate that at least three Japanese type II FCoVs emerged independently. Sera from a cat experimentally infected with type I FCoV was unable to neutralize type II CCoV infection, indicating that cats persistently infected with type I FCoV may be superinfected with type II CCoV. Our previous study reported that few Japanese cats have antibody against type II FCoV.

Nine patients were younger than 60 years. Eight patients had risk factors for osteonecrosis. Necrosis was extensive and involved nearly the whole femoral head. Fracture occurred at the junction between a necrotic bone and reparative bone and extended downward through the reparative interface to the healthy inferior cortex of the femoral neck. Patients experienced hip pain that was aggravated gradually during a period of 1 to 24 weeks before diagnosis of the fracture. In all patients, the opposite femoral head was involved with osteonecrosis. In two femoral heads, slight collapse or subchondral fracture (crescent sign) also was observed. No patient had a history of precipitating trauma. In patients younger than 60 years with a subcapital fracture, fracture associated with extensive osteonecrosis of the femoral head should be suspected when a history of trauma is not obvious, when the opposite hip shows findings of osteonecrosis, and when the patient has a risk factor of osteonecrosis. In these fractures, osteosynthesis rarely should be considered because of the high failure rate caused by additional progression of extensive osteonecrosis and the probability of nonunion.",

Disease primers,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but highly aggressive skin cancer with neuroendocrine features. MCC pathogenesis is associated with either the presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus or chronic exposure to ultraviolet light (UV), which can cause a characteristic pattern of multiple DNA mutations. Notably, in the Northern hemisphere, the majority of MCC cases are of viral aetiology; by contrast, in areas with high UV exposure, UV-mediated carcinogenesis is predominant. The two aetiologies share similar clinical, histopathological and prognostic characteristics. MCC presents with a solitary cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule, most frequently in sun-exposed areas. In fact, UV exposure is probably involved in both viral-mediated and non-viral-mediated carcinogenesis, by contributing to immunosuppression or DNA damage, respectively. Confirmation of diagnosis relies on analyses of histological features and immunological marker expression profiles of the lesion. At primary diagnosis, loco-regional metastases are already present in ∼30% of patients. Excision of the tumour is the first-line therapy; if not feasible, radiotherapy can often effectively control the disease. Chemotherapy was the only alternative in advanced-stage or refractory MCC until several clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors.",

Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify the antigen and to develop an assay with Caspr2-expressing cells. Immunoabsorption with Caspr2 and comparative immunostaining of brain and peripheral nerve of wild-type and Caspr2-null mice were used to assess antibody specificity.<h4>Results</h4>Using Caspr2-expressing cells, antibodies were identified in 8 patients but not in 140 patients with several types of autoimmune or viral encephalitis, PNH, or mutations of the Caspr2-encoding gene. Patients' antibodies reacted with brain and peripheral nerve in a pattern that colocalized with Caspr2. This reactivity was abrogated after immunoabsorption with Caspr2 and was absent in tissues from Caspr2-null mice. Of the 8 patients with Caspr2 antibodies, 7 had encephalopathy or seizures, 5 neuropathy or PNH, and 1 isolated PNH.

None of the patients had active cancer; 7 responded to immunotherapy and were healthy or only mildly disabled at last follow-up (median, 8 months; range, 6-84 months).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Caspr2 is an autoantigen of encephalitis and PNH previously attributed to VGKC antibodies. The occurrence of other autoantibodies may result in a complex syndrome that at presentation could be mistaken for a motor neuron disorder.

Sabah State, located on the island of Borneo, has previously reported a particularly high burden of disease and faces unique contextual challenges compared with peninsular Malaysia. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of TB in Sabah to identify risk groups and hotspots of TB transmission.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a retrospective review of TB cases notified in Sabah, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2018. Using data from the state's 'myTB' notification database, we calculated the case notification rate and described trends in the epidemiology, diagnostic practices and treatment outcomes of TB in Sabah within this period. The Chi-squared test was used for determining the difference between two proportions.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2012 and 2018 there were 33 193 cases of TB reported in Sabah (128 cases per 100 000 population). We identified several geographic hotspots, including districts with > 200 cases per 100 000 population per year. TB rates increased with age and were highest in older males. Children < 15 years accounted for only 4.6% of cases. Moderate or advanced disease on chest X-ray and sputum smear positivity was high (58 and 81% of cases respectively), suggesting frequent late diagnosis. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB prevalence was low (0.3% of TB cases), however, rapid diagnostic test coverage was low (1.2%) and only 18% of all cases had a positive culture result. Treatment success was 83% (range: 81-85%) in those with drug-sensitive TB and 36% (range: 25-45%) in cases of MDR-TB.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Between 2012 and 2018, TB notifications in Sabah State equated to 20% of Malaysia's total TB notifications, despite Sabah representing only 10% of Malaysia's population. We found hotspots of TB in urbanised population hubs and points of migration, as well as evidence of late presentation and diagnosis.

The MRI artifact induced by the cochlear implant magnet is a known problem that should be further observed by this investigation.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared the artifacts of Cochlear 512 magnets at different head positions in vivo at 3 T. The observed positions varied with a nasion-external ear canal angle of 90, 120, and 160 degrees and a variable distance of 5, 7, and 9 cm in relation to the external ear canal and different MRI sequences.<h4>Results</h4>The complete assessment of the internal auditory canal and labyrinth was possible with a magnet positioned at 90 degrees and 9 cm and 160 degrees and 9 cm. Evaluation of the IAC alone was possible with magnet positions at 90 degrees and 7 cm and 9 cm, 120 degrees and 9 cm, and 160 degrees and 7 cm and 9 cm. A high-resolution 3D T2w Drive sequence decreased the visibility of the structures significantly. A high-resolution TSE 2D T2w sequence together with one of the above-described positions allowed sufficient visualization of the structures.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The position of the implant and the MRI sequence used determine the assessment of the IAC and the labyrinth at 3 T MRI. A position of the implant magnet at a nasion-external auditory canal angle which is more horizontal and posterior than so far commonly used allows a better visualization of the IAC and the labyrinth at 3 T.",

Nineteen of 20 GISTs expressed DOG-1 and 12 of 20 were diffusely positive (≥95%) with moderate to strong intensity. There was focal, predominantly luminal staining of colorectal (three of 10), endometrioid (four of 10) and acinic cell carcinomas (four of five). One case each of spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma (2+), schwannoma (trace) and MPNST (2+) showed DOG-1 expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study supports that DOG-1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for GISTs and also highlights hitherto unrecognized and unusual patterns of expression in non-mesenchymal neoplasms.",

Two nodular lesions in the left and right lobes of the liver were clinically diagnosed as metastatic tumours by computed tomography of the abdomen. A demarcating grey-white mass of size 1.4 cm was observed in a partially resected liver specimen. On examining the lesion microscopically, it was found to be composed of hyperplastic lymphoid follicles, lymphocytes, plasma cells, other inflammatory cells and interlaced hyalinised fibrous tissues. In the portal tracts around the lesion, chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates were seen, but no interface hepatitis or lymphoid follicle was observed. No evidence of monoclonality was observed by immunohistochemistry for B and T cell markers, in situ hybridisation for kappa and lambda light chains, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chains or T cell receptor beta and gamma gene rearrangements. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was not observed in the germinal centre. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen (latent membrane protein-1) and EBV-encoded small RNAs were not detected. A proliferation neither of myofibroblasts nor of cells positive for follicular dendritic cell markers was observed. RLH, formerly known as pseudolymphoma, has been reported of the liver in only 14 cases and is considered to be a differential diagnosis of small nodular lesions of the liver. That RLH has an inflammatory reactive nature, not a neoplastic disposition, and that EBV does not participate in the pathogenesis of RLH is supported by this case.",

Two questionnaires were developed. A 16-item Binge Eating Scale was constructed describing both behavioral manifestations (e.g., eating large amounts of food) and feeling/cognitions surrounding a binge episode (e.g., guilt, fear of being unable to stop eating). An 11-item Cognitive Factors Scale was developed measure two cognitive phenomena thought to be related to binge eating: the tendency to set unrealistic standards for a diet (e.g., eliminating ""favorite foods"") and low efficacy expectations for sustaining a diet. The results showed that the Binge Eating Scale successfully discriminated among persons judged by trained interviewers to have either no, moderate or severe binge eating problems. Significant correlation between the scales were obtained such that severe bingers tended to set up diets which were unrealistically strict while reporting low efficacy expectations to sustain a diet. The discussion highlighted the differences among obese persons on binge eating severity and emphasized the role of cognitions in the relapse of self control of eating.",

Patients were enrolled between August 7, 2014, and December 29, 2015. Analyses for this report were conducted at the time of database lock on June 20, 2019.<h4>Interventions</h4>Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo, 150 mg, every 12 hours on a continuous schedule plus fulvestrant, 500 mg, per label. Randomization was stratified based on site of metastasis (visceral, bone only, or other) and resistance to prior ET (primary vs secondary).<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Overall survival was a gated key secondary end point. The boundary P value for the interim analysis was .02.<h4>Results</h4>Of 669 women enrolled, 446 (median [range] age, 59 [32-91] years) were randomized to the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm and 223 (median [range] age, 62 [32-87] years) were randomized to the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. At the prespecified interim, 338 deaths (77% of the planned 441 at the final analysis) were observed in the intent-to-treat population, with a median OS of 46.7 months for abemaciclib plus fulvestrant and 37.3 months for placebo plus fulvestrant (hazard ratio [HR], 0.757; 95% CI, 0.606-0.945; P = .01). Improvement in OS was consistent across all stratification factors. Among stratification factors, more pronounced effects were observed in patients with visceral disease (HR, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.511-0.891) and primary resistance to prior ET (HR, 0.686; 95% CI, 0.451-1.043). Time to second disease progression (median, 23.1 months vs 20.6 months), time to chemotherapy (median, 50.2 months vs 22.1 months), and chemotherapy-free survival (median, 25.5 months vs 18.2 months) were also statistically significantly improved in the abemaciclib arm vs placebo arm. No new safety signals were observed for abemaciclib.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Treatment with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful median OS improvement of 9.4 months for patients with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative ABC who progressed after prior ET regardless of menopausal status. Abemaciclib substantially delayed the receipt of subsequent chemotherapy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02107703.",https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/articlepdf/2752266/jamaoncology_sledge_2019_oi_190093.pdf

To pinpoint key regulatory domains involved in development and evolution of the vertebrate genitourinary system, we have isolated WT1 orthologues from all gnathostome classes. Partial nucleotide sequence from chick, alligator, Xenopus laevis and zebrafish reveals extensive conservation. Both the zinc fingers and the transregulatory domain exhibit a high level of similarity in all the species examined. However, of the two alternatively spliced regions only one, the three amino acid KTS insertion between zinc fingers 3 and 4, is found in species other than mammals. The 17 amino acid insertion at the C-terminal end of the transregulatory domain is present only in mammals. Residues with reported human pathological mutations are also unaltered across species, underlining their structural significance. Studies in chick and alligator reveal that the mammalian intermediate mesoderm expression pattern is conserved in birds and reptiles. A wider role in mesodermal differentiation is suggested by expression in some paraxial and lateral mesoderm derivatives.",

Several drug candidates have been suggested as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19, including remdesivir, currently the only authorized drug for use under an Emergency Use Authorization. However, there is only limited information regarding the safety profiles of the proposed drugs, in particular drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity and cardiotoxicity of remdesivir using cardiomyocytes-derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs) as an alternative source of human primary cardiomyocytes (CMs). In this study, remdesivir exhibited up to 60-fold higher antiviral activity in hPSC-CMs compared to Vero E6 cells; however, it also induced moderate cardiotoxicity in these cells. To gain further insight into the drug-induced arrhythmogenic risk, we assessed QT interval prolongation and automaticity of remdesivir-treated hPSC-CMs using a multielectrode array (MEA). As a result, the data indicated a potential risk of QT prolongation when remdesivir is used at concentrations higher than the estimated peak plasma concentration. Therefore, we conclude that close monitoring of the electrocardiographic/QT interval should be advised in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients under remdesivir medication, in particular individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7571425?pdf=render

The early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and multidrug resistance is a priority in TB diagnosis to improve the successful treatment rate of TB and reduce transmission. The Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) test, recently endorsed by the World Health Organization for the detection of pulmonary TB, was evaluated to test its utility in 547 patients with suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Five hundred forty-seven extrapulmonary specimens were split and processed simultaneously for both culture (solid and liquid) and Xpert testing. For culture, the sensitivity was low, 53% (150/283 specimens). Xpert sensitivity and specificity results were assessed in comparison to a composite reference standard made up of smear and culture results and clinical, radiological, and histological findings. The sensitivity of the Xpert assay was 81% (228/283 specimens) (64% [89/138] for smear-negative cases and 96% [139/145] for smear-positive cases), with a specificity of 99.6%. The sensitivity was found to be high for the majority of specimen types (63 to 100%) except for cerebrospinal fluid, the sensitivity of which was 29% (2/7 specimens). The Xpert test correctly identified 98% of phenotypic rifampin (RIF)-resistant cases and 94% of phenotypic RIF-susceptible cases. Sequencing of the 6 discrepant samples resolved 3 of them, resulting in an increased specificity of 98%. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the Xpert test also shows good potential for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB and that its ease of use makes it applicable for countries where TB is endemic.",

Recent developments offer the potential to improve both the assessment and treatment of patients.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Vascular imaging is increasingly being used in the diagnostic algorithm for GCA. Results from recent vascular ultrasound and high-resolution cranial MRI studies have led some groups to suggest forgoing temporal artery biopsy (TAB) in selected patients. The treatment armamentarium has been enhanced with the addition of Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-6 and has been shown to be effective in sustaining glucocorticoid-free remission out to 52 weeks. New publications have provided guidance in how clinicians can interpret minimally inflamed biopsies and navigate the controversy about what role, if any, varicella zoster virus may play in the pathophysiology of GCA. Basic science developments have improved our understanding of the immunopathology of GCA including the role of Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes and mechanisms of arterial wall lymphocyte invasion.<h4>Summary</h4>There have been significant recent advances in GCA, particularly in relation to imaging and treatment options. Longer term outcome data will help clarify how best to utilize them in routine clinical practice.",

This disorder usually develops acutely, and research has suggested that high-dose steroid therapy soon after the onset of visual loss can result in significant visual improvement. This treatment, however, is not universally successful. The addition of a potent vasodilator could help to restore ocular blood flow. This case report describes the use of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a powerful vasodilator of the microcirculation, to treat three separate episodes of NA-PION over five years in the same patient. A 68-year-old white male was first seen in June 2009 with NA-PION in the left eye, and the condition was treated with steroids and PGE1. The patient had a subsequent episode in July 2010 that was treated with steroids and PGE1 and another in May 2014 that was treated with PGE1 alone. Visual acuity improved from 4/10 to 11/10 in 2009, from 4/10 to 11/10 in 2010, and from 5/10 to 10/10 in 2014. No complications due to the use of PGE1 were noted. PGE1 should be considered as a treatment for NA-PION to immediately restore blood flow and potentially improve vision.",

As such, the differential operation of the brain centers underlying EFs (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]) may explain controlled aspects of dietary self-control. The present study was designed to examine the causal relationship between DLPFC function and two aspects of dietary self-control: visceral cravings and actual consumptive behaviors.<h4>Methods</h4>The research was conducted using a within-participant design. A sample of 21 healthy female young adults aged 19 to 26 years (mean [M; standard deviation] = 21.10 [1.86] years) received both active and sham continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to the left DLPFC. Before and after each session, subjective food cravings were assessed using the Food Craving Questionnaire-State. After each stimulation session, participants competed three measures of EF (Stroop, Go/No-Go, and Stop-Signal) and a bogus taste test.<h4>Results</h4>Participants reported larger increases in snack food cravings after active stimulation (M = 9.98% change, standard error [SE] = 0.45) than after sham stimulation (M = -3.46, SE = 0.39, p = .012) on the reinforcement anticipation dimension of Food Craving Questionnaire-State. Likewise, participants consumed significantly more snack foods after active stimulation (M = 70.62 grams, SE = 5.17) than after sham stimulation (M = 61.33, SE = 3.56, p = .006). Finally, performance on the Stroop task was reduced more after active (M = 71.56 milliseconds, SE = 25.18) than after sham stimulation (M = 20.16, SE = 13.32, p = .033); reduction in Stroop performance mediated the effect of active stimulation on increased appetitive food consumption.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results support the contention that EF strength, as modulated by DLPFC activity, is causally associated with effective dietary self-control.",

We aimed to introduce the role of immune-modulators (corticosteroid and/or intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG) treatment for childhood MP pneumonia based on previous our experiences.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A retrospective case series analysis for 183 children with MP pneumonia was performed. MP pneumonia patients were diagnosed by two Immunoglobulin M (IgM) tests: the micro-particle agglutination method (≥1:40) and the cold agglutination test (≥1:4), and were examined twice at the initial admission and at discharge. Among 183 MP pneumonia patients, 90 patients with persistent fever for over 48 hours after admission or those with severe respiratory symptoms and signs received additional prednisolone (82 patients, 1 mg/kg/day) or intravenous methylprednisolone (8 patients, 5-10 mg/kg/day) with antibiotics. Four patients with aggravated clinical symptoms and chest radiographic findings after corticosteroid treatment received IVIG (1 g/kg/day, 1-2 doses).<h4>Results</h4>Mean age of 183 patients was 5.5 ± 3.2 years (6 months-15 years), and the male: female ratio was 1.1:1 (96:87). Fifty-seven patients (31%) were seroconverters and 126 seropositive patients showed increased diagnostic IgM antibody titres during admission (over 4 folds). The majority of the patients who received corticosteroids (86/90 cases) showed rapid defervescence within 48 hours with improved clinical symptoms, regardless of the used antibiotics. Also, 4 patients who received additional IVIG improved both clinically and radiographically within 2 days without adverse reaction.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the era of macrolide-resistant MP strains, early additional immune-modulator therapy with antibiotics might prevent from the disease progression and reduce the disease morbidity without adverse reaction.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4285006?pdf=render

This knowledge objective cannot be achieved without a prerequisite knowledge of primitive venous system. We present here an update on the development of the transverse foramen venous system through a literature review. Our review of the classical literature aimed at synthesis of available related embryological knowledge and relating this synthesis to cervical vertebrae anatomy. Our findings with regard to different primitive descriptions were consistent and often complementary across the studies. The description has varied from a single vertebral vein to a single vein divided at certain areas, or even to a confluence of venous plexus. In this manner, the embryonic knowledge for instance on venous system can help us to better understand the segmental development of vertebral veins and their plexus arrangement. Furthermore, the cranial-caudal embryology, in particular of the nervous system, conveys the initial plexiform arrangement of vertebral veins, which ends into a single venous trunk joining the subclavian vein.",

Patients with IVC atresia were identified based on imaging and chart review. Differences in demographics and thrombotic risk factors between patients with and without IVC atresia were statistically assessed. Extent and chronicity of DVT on imaging, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes were evaluated for all patients with IVC atresia.<h4>Results</h4>4.2% of DVT patients (17/409) were found to have IVC atresia; mean age at diagnosis was 25.5 ± 9.4 years. The rate of heritable thrombophilia was significantly higher in patients with IVC atresia compared to patients without IVC atresia (52.9% vs. 17.9%, p < 0.0001). There were bilateral DVT in 70.6% of IVC atresia patients; DVT was chronic in 41.2% and acute on chronic in 58.8%. Pre-intervention Villalta scores were 13.9 ± 9.8 in the left limb and 8.5 ± 7.0 in the right limb. DVT in IVC atresia patients was typically treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by stent placement, achieving complete or partial symptom resolution in 78.6% of cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Thrombotic risk factors such as heritable thrombophilia are associated with IVC atresia. IVC atresia patients can experience high burdens of lower-extremity thrombotic disease at a young age which benefit from endovascular treatment.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level 4.",

We conducted a retrospective, dosimetric study to evaluate the relationship between hearing loss after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and the dose-volume of irradiated cochlea.<h4>Methods</h4>Cochlear dose data were retrospectively collected on consecutive patients who underwent SRS (18 Gy in 3 sessions) for vestibular schwannoma between 1999 and 2005 at Stanford University Hospital. Inclusion criteria included Gardner-Robertson (GR) grade I or II hearing prior to radiosurgical treatment, complete audiograms, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up. A cochlea dose-volume histogram was generated for each of the 94 patients who qualified for this study.<h4>Results</h4>GR grade I-II hearing posttreatment was maintained in 74% of patients (70/94). Median time to last follow-up audiogram was 2.4 years (range 0.4-8.9) and to last MRI was 3.6 years (range 0.5-9.4). Each higher level of cochlear irradiation was associated with increased risk of hearing loss. Larger cochlear volume was associated with lower risk of hearing loss. Controlling for differences in cochlear volume among subjects, each additional mm(3) of cochlea receiving 10 to 16 Gy (single session equivalent doses of 6.6-10.1 Gy3) significantly increased the odds of hearing loss by approximately 5%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Larger cochlear volume is associated with lower risk of hearing loss following trisession SRS for vestibular schwannoma. Controlling for this phenomenon, higher radiation dose and larger irradiated cochlear volume are significantly associated with higher risk of hearing loss. This study confirms and quantifies the risk of hearing loss following trisession SRS for vestibular schwannoma.",

We identified 6 such children (male/female: 3/3) aged 3-9 years who were treated between 1998 and 2006. During the same period, 190 children with MP were admitted to our institution.<h4>Results</h4>Common laboratory findings of the patients included cytopenia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, and elevated urine beta(2)-microglobulin levels, suggesting complication of hypercytokinemic condition. We initiated intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/kg on 10.2+/-2.8 clinical days and administered it once daily for 3 consecutive days.

Significant results have been achieved to the point where near lead-free procedures in routine clinical practice has become a realistic goal. The integration of MediGuide technology [non-fluoroscopic catheter visualization technology (NFCV)] and three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping is one of the methods developed in response to radiation reduction initiatives. We aimed to evaluate the impact of this NFCV technology on atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation in terms of reduction in procedural and radiation time as well as safety aspects.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Between March 2012 and March 2017, a total of 1000 patients underwent AF ablation using NFCV. Patient and procedural data and complications within the first 3 months were entered into a prospective registry and analysed. We assessed procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and dose and complications. In a cohort of 1000 patients (62.9 ± 11 years; 72% men; left ventricular ejection fraction 57%; and left atrial diameter 43.2 mm), the median procedure time was 120 min, median fluoroscopy time was 0.90 min, and the median fluoroscopy dose of was 345.1 cGy · cm2. Stratification of the first (Group 1) and the last 250 (Group 2) cases showed significant improvement in the median procedure time (140-110 min) and reduction in the median fluoroscopy time (6-0.5 min) and the median dose (2263-151.9 cGy · cm2). The overall complication rate was 2.0%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of NFCV technology enables safe, consistent, and 'near lead-free' performance of AF ablation in routine clinical practice.",

Herein, we provide a summary of the current knowledge of TED management, followed by discussion of a novel insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) antagonist antibody and its potential to change the course of the disease.<h4>Design</h4>Perspective.<h4>Methods</h4>Review of the literature and authors' experience.<h4>Results</h4>Many publications demonstrate IGF-1R overexpression in TED, and its activation as an autoantigen as a critical factor in TED pathogenesis. Several in vitro studies demonstrate that IGF-1R inhibition attenuates downstream molecular events including cytokine and hyaluronan production, and cellular differentiation. These observations led to the hypothesis that blocking IGF-1R may abrogate the clinical progression of TED. The recent completion of phase 2 and 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrate the efficacy and safety of teprotumumab, a fully human monoclonal IGF-1R antagonist antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe, active TED. Both the phase 2 and the recent phase 3 study results demonstrate that more patients with active TED receiving teprotumumab experienced a meaningful improvement in proptosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Current TED treatment strategies target inflammation and symptoms, but do not modify the disease course. Therefore, proptosis as well as strabismus and its resulting diplopia often remain, impacting patient well-being and quality of life over the long term. Targeted molecular therapy using teprotumumab demonstrates disease-modifying benefits with the potential to shift the paradigm for TED treatment.",

Mutations in the last titin immunoglobulin (Ig) domain M10, which interacts with the N-terminal Ig-domains of obscurin and obsl1, lead to hereditary muscle diseases. The M10 domain is unusual not only in that it is a frequent target of disease-linked mutations, but also in that it is the only currently known muscle Ig-domain that interacts with two ligands--obscurin and obsl1--in different sarcomeric subregions. Using x-ray crystallography, we show the structural basis for titin M10 interaction with obsl1 in a novel antiparallel Ig-Ig architecture and unravel the molecular basis of titin-M10 linked myopathies. The severity of these pathologies correlates with the disruption of the titin-obsl1/obscurin complex. Conserved signature residues at the interface account for differences in affinity that direct the cellular sorting in cardiomyocytes. By engineering the interface signature residues of obsl1 to obscurin, and vice versa, their affinity for titin can be modulated similar to the native proteins. In single-molecule force-spectroscopy experiments, both complexes yield at forces of around 30 pN, much lower than those observed for the mechanically stable Z-disk complex of titin and telethonin, suggesting why even moderate weakening of the obsl1/obscurin-titin links has severe consequences for normal muscle functions.",

A case following osteonecrosis of the femoral head is quite rare; even more uncommon is its occurrence in the bilateral hips. Magnetic resonance imaging has been established as the preferred tool for diagnosing nondisplaced femoral neck stress fracture due to overuse injury. Magnetic resonance imaging was also useful to detect the initial lesion even in this case, although the etiology was different between overuse injury and insufficiency fracture.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 41-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with bilateral early stage idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head was observed non-weight-bearing as much as possible using a stick. However, her pain and difficulty in walking progressed. Bilateral femoral neck stress fractures were subsequently detected by magnetic resonance imaging. The fracture initially appeared as a spot of bone marrow edema at the medial site of the femoral neck, and then developed into a fracture line. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the preparatory reaming served as core decompression of the femoral heads, as well as being treatment for osteonecrosis. Her bone mineral density and 25-hydroxy vitamin D values were low for her age. We administered eldecalcitol and teriparatide acetate. Her symptoms mostly improved, and the fracture lines and necrotic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging reduced at 5 months after the surgery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Bilateral femoral neck stress fractures are a very rare condition and are often missed. It is important to listen to the patient's complaints and perform an appropriate examination. We encountered a case of bilateral femoral neck stress fracture that occurred in a patient with early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and were able to observe progression of stress fracture since before fracture occurred.

Early clinical trials with SRS proved that tumor control rates are superior to whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone. As a result, WBRT plus SRS was widely adopted for patients with a limited number of brain metastases (""limited number"" customarily means 1-4). Subsequent trials focused on answering whether WBRT upfront was necessary at all. Based on current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses comparing SRS alone to SRS plus WBRT, adjuvant WBRT results in better intracranial control; however, at the expense of neurocognitive functioning and quality of life. These adverse effects of WBRT may also negatively impact on survival in younger patients. Based on the results of these studies, treatment has shifted to SRS alone in patients with a limited number of metastases. Additionally, RCTs are evaluating the role of SRS alone in patients with >4 brain metastases. New developments in SRS include fractionated SRS for large tumors and the integration of SRS with targeted systemic therapies that cross the blood brain barrier and/or stimulate an immune response.

They are inflammatory-demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system and likely have an immunologic pathogenesis. Although these neuropathies usually have a characteristic presentation, the electromyographer plays a central role in their recognition, since the demyelinating component of the neuropathy, which greatly reduces the differential diagnosis, is often first identified in the electromyography laboratory. In AIDP, the electromyographer, in addition to establishing the diagnosis, can sometimes predict the prognosis. Recognition of the chronic and dysproteinemic forms of acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy is important since they are treatable.

Although there is a large variability in ""mean"" predicted MIP depending on the chosen reference values, it remains unclear whether those discrepancies actually impact on the prevalence of weakness, that is, MIP below the lower limit of normal.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 1,729 subjects (50.1% men, aged 20 to 94 years) who underwent MIP measurements in a clinical laboratory comprised the study group. MIP was predicted according to the most frequently cited regression equations as of August 2015. Pretest probability of weakness was defined by a cluster of clinical and physiologic variables.<h4>Results</h4>Prevalence of weakness ranged from 33.4 to 66.9%. Set 2 equations agreed well in indicating weakness (κ [95% CI] ranging from 0.81 [0.79-0.83] to 0.83 [0.81-0.85]; P < .01). There was closer agreement between higher pretest probability of weakness and low MIP according to set 2 equations compared with set 1 equations. Thus, a significant fraction of subjects with abnormal MIP according to set 1 equations but preserved MIP according to set 2 equations had higher pretest probability of weakness (P < .05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The choice of MIP reference values strongly impacts on the prevalence of weakness. Some specific equations relate better to clinical and physiologic indicators of weakness, suggesting that they might be particularly useful to screen subjects for advanced respiratory neuromuscular assessment.",

Relevant prospective literature was reviewed through a Medline search of English-language articles published between 1966 and March 2012. GBS causes severe persistent disability in 14% of patients at 1 year. Loss of full strength, persistent pain and need for professional change occurs in about 40%. Mortality is of about 4% within the first year. Analysis of prognostic predictors consistently demonstrates the negative impact of higher age, preceding diarrhoea, greater disability/weaker muscles at admission, short interval between symptom-onset and admission, mechanical ventilation and absent/low amplitude compound muscle action potentials.

The purpose of this study was to describe the normal anatomic development and complex of anomalies of the human fetal venous system and to review recently published series of these anomalies.<h4>Methods</h4>Normal embryologic and anatomic development is described. An English language literature search of recent MEDLINE listings was performed to glean data from recently published series reporting prenatal diagnosis of the various anomalies and their associated malformations.<h4>Results</h4>Anomalies of the human fetal venous system occur sporadically, often associated with cardiac or other malformations. The pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to abnormal in utero development of the human venous system remain largely undetermined. On the basis of the type of vein involved, embryologic precursor, and etiologic correlation (primary or secondary), classification into 4 major groups is described.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Prenatal evaluation of fetuses found to have anomalies of the venous system should include a careful search for cardiac anomalies, including pulmonary venous drainage, and a detailed anatomic survey of the umbilical, portal, hepatic, and ductal systems to determine aberrant communication and, if possible, to discover clues to systemic diseases or thromboembolic phenomena.",

To investigate the clinical features of severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia in adults admitted to an intensive care unit, a multi-centre CAP surveillance study was performed. Among all hospitalized CAP cases between January 2000 and December 2004, there were 227 cases with M. pneumoniae pneumonia without the complication of other pathogens. A total of 13 of the cases required admission to an intensive care unit because of acute respiratory failure (ARF), and the remaining 214 cases (non-ARF) were low to moderately severe. The clinical features of ARF cases were compared with those of non-ARF cases. The underlying conditions in both types of case were identical, whereas clinical findings on admission clearly differed between the two groups. A regimen of an antibiotic effective against M. pneumoniae was begun on average at 9.3 days after the onset of symptoms in ARF cases, which was significantly later than for non-ARF cases (P<0.0001). However, two of the ARF cases progressed to respiratory failure despite the fact that adequate antibiotics were initially administered within 3 days after the onset of symptoms. All ARF cases received corticosteroids with adequate antibiotics, and their condition improved promptly. These results indicate that the clinical features, excluding underlying conditions, clearly differed between severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia and low to moderately severe pneumonia.

However, specific cases were rarely described until 2018, when a wave of reports surfaced. With expanding I-O indications in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant curative setting, growing numbers of patients will receive limited courses of immunotherapy before entering routine surveillance. In this context, under-recognition of DIRE could pose a growing clinical hazard.<h4>Methods</h4>The aim of this study was to characterize DIRE through identification of existing reports of delayed post-treatment irAE in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. We performed a PubMed literature review from 2008 through 2018 to determine the median data safety reporting window from existing I-O clinical trials, which we then applied to define the DIRE cutoff, and collated all qualifying reports over the same time span. DIRE was defined as new immune-related adverse events (irAE) manifesting ≥90 days after discontinuation of immunotherapy.<h4>Results</h4>Median duration of I-O clinical trials data safety reporting was 90 days (82% ≤ 90 days). DIRE cutoff was thus set as ≥90 days post-immunotherapy. We identified 23 qualifying cases; 21 by literature review and 2 from our institution. Median off-treatment interval to DIRE was 6 months (range: 3 to 28). Median cumulative immunotherapy exposure was 4 doses (range: 3 to 42). Involvement included endocrine, neurologic, GI, pulmonary, cardiac, rheumatologic and dermatologic irAE.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As immunotherapy indications expand into the curative setting, often with brief exposure and potentially sequenced with multimodality treatments, it will be necessary to recognize an emerging diagnostic complex, which we have termed delayed immune-related events (DIRE). Clinical vigilance has the potential to reduce morbidity from diagnostic delay, as irAE are generally manageable with prompt initiation of treatment - or from misdiagnosis - as misattribution can lead to unnecessary or harmful interventions as we describe. DIRE should therefore figure prominently in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with illnesses of unclear etiology, irrespective of intervening treatments or interval post-immunotherapy, both of which can confound diagnosis. Increased recognition will rest on delineation of DIRE as a clinical diagnostic entity.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6609357?pdf=render

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a rare disease that can cause severe dehydration along with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia because of renal tubular unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. Autosomal dominant PHA1 (ADPHA1, OMIM #177735) is caused by inactivating mutations in the <i>NR3C2</i> gene, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor, and it can lead to renal salt-wasting, dehydration, and failure to thrive during infancy. Here, we report a case of a 20-day-old female neonate who presented as severe dehydration with hyponatremia and polyuria. We suspected that her diagnosis might be PHA1 based on markedly elevated plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels. For the genetic diagnosis of PHA1, we performed targeted exome sequencing of all causative genes of PHA1, but the result was negative. We confirmed by chromosomal microarray that a novel heterozygous microdeletion was found in the 4q31.23 region spanning exons 7-9 of the <i>NR3C2</i> gene, and the patient was diagnosed with ADPHA1.

Its waveform is related to the pressure-volume changes in the cardiac atria and it is therefore important in the monitoring of any fetal condition that may affect forward cardiac function. The cardiovascular parameters that can influence forward cardiac function include afterload, myocardial performance and preload. Decreased forward flow during atrial systole (a-wave) is the most sensitive and ubiquitous finding when any of these parameters is affected. In contrast, decreased forward velocities during end-systolic relaxation (v-wave) are more specifically related to myocardial performance. The ductus venosus pulsatility index alone does not accurately reflect cardiac function, and in cases of suspected fetal cardiac dysfunction, echocardiography is required to identify the underlying mechanism. The role of ductus venosus Doppler in the assessment of fetal growth restriction, supraventricular tachycardia, fetal hydrops, complicated monochorionic twins and congenital heart disease is discussed with these considerations in mind.",

The interpretation of the numerous rare variants identified in TTN is a difficult challenge given its large size.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify genetic variants in titin in a cohort of patients with muscle disorders.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>In this case series, 9 patients with titinopathy and 4 other patients with possibly disease-causing variants in TTN were identified. Titin mutations were detected through targeted resequencing performed on DNA from 504 patients with muscular dystrophy, congenital myopathy, or other skeletal muscle disorders. Patients were enrolled from 10 clinical centers in April 2012 to December 2013. All of them had not received a diagnosis after undergoing an extensive investigation, including Sanger sequencing of candidate genes. The data analysis was performed between September 2013 and January 2017. Sequencing data were analyzed using an internal custom bioinformatics pipeline.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The identification of novel mutations in the TTN gene and novel patients with titinopathy. We performed an evaluation of putative causative variants in the TTN gene, combining genetic, clinical, and imaging data with messenger RNA and/or protein studies.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 9 novel patients with titinopathy, 5 (55.5%) were men and the mean (SD) age at onset was 25 (15.8) years (range, 0-46 years). Of the 4 other patients (3 men and 1 woman) with possibly disease-causing TTN variants, 2 (50%) had a congenital myopathy and 2 (50%) had a slowly progressive distal myopathy with onset in the second decade. Most of the identified mutations were previously unreported. However, all the variants, even the already described mutations, require careful clinical and molecular evaluation of probands and relatives. Heterozygous truncating variants or unique missense changes are not sufficient to make a diagnosis of titinopathy.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>The interpretation of TTN variants often requires further analyses, including a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical phenotype (deep phenotyping) as well as messenger RNA and protein studies. We propose a specific workflow for the clinical interpretation of genetic findings in titin.",

When impairment occurs after brain damage, the profiles of affective-prosodic disturbances differ depending on the hemisphere injured. Patients with left brain damage (LBD) improve their performance whereas patients with right brain damage (RBD) do not when the verbal-articulatory demands of the test stimuli are reduced systematically. One of the major arguments for a right hemispheric contribution to schizophrenia has been the documentation of affective prosodic deficits under the assumption that these abnormalities reflect right hemispheric dysfunction. Thus, an essential question to resolve is whether the profile of affective prosodic disturbances in schizophrenia is similar to LBD or RBD, or represents a unique variation.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were collected from four subject groups: 45 chronic, medication-stabilised, schizophrenic patients, 10 patients with focal LBD, nine patients with focal RBD, and 19 controls. All groups were tested on the aprosodia battery, which uses stimuli having incrementally reduced verbal-articulatory demands. Schizophrenic and aphasic symptoms were evaluated using standard assessment tools.<h4>Results</h4>For patients with impaired performance on the aprosodia battery, schizophrenic patients were statistically identical to patients with RBD and robustly different from those with LBD. Thirty eight schizophrenic patients (84.4%) were found to have some type of affective prosodic deficit with the predominant pattern indicating, at minimum, right posterior sylvian dysfunction (57.8%). When schizophrenic symptoms and aprosodic deficits were examined using a principal component analysis, affective comprehension and repetition loaded uniquely as separate factors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The profile of affective-prosodic deficits found in impaired schizophrenic patients is characteristic of RBD, supporting the concept that schizophrenia is a bihemispheric disease process. These deficits may also represent cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia as they are highly prevalent and, except for spontaneous affective prosody, are not associated statistically with traditional clusters of schizophrenic symptoms.",

All had serum/cerebrospinal fluid antibodies that predominantly immunolabeled the neuropil of hippocampus/forebrain, in particular the cell surface of hippocampal neurons, and reacted with NR2B (and to a lesser extent NR2A) subunits of the NMDAR. NR2B binds glutamate and forms heteromers (NR1/NR2B or NR1/NR2A/NR2B) that are preferentially expressed in the adult hippocampus/forebrain. Expression of functional heteromers (not single subunits) was required for antibody binding. Eleven patients had teratoma of the ovary (six mature) and one a mature teratoma in the mediastinum; five of five tumors examined contained nervous tissue that strongly expressed NR2 subunits and reacted with patients' antibodies. Tumor resection and immunotherapy resulted in improvement or full recovery of eight of nine patients (paralleled by decreased antibody titers); two of three patients without tumor resection died of neurological deterioration. Autopsies showed extensive microgliosis, rare T-cell infiltrates, and neuronal degeneration predominantly involving, but not restricted to, the hippocampus.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Antibodies to NR2B- and NR2A-containing heteromers of the NMDAR associate with a severe but treatment-responsive encephalitis.

The study was divided into three groups according to the used repair materials: titanium mesh (16 cases), Medpor (12 cases), and Medpor titanium mesh (26 cases). All test data were analyzed using the SPSS version 23.0 statistical software. The mean age and duration of disease between the groups were compared through one-way analysis of variance. The Chi-square (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>) test was used to compare the number of males and females, different fracture types, and different surgical approaches among groups. The <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the frequencies for complications in each group.<h4>Results</h4>The baseline characteristics of age and gender in each group were matched (<i>F</i>=1.763, <i>P</i>=0.172; <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>=0.026, <i>P</i>=0.987). In addition, there was no difference in the type of fracture and surgical approach (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>=0.460, <i>P</i>=0.977; <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>=0.691, <i>P</i>=0.952), or the incidence of complications (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>=0.081, <i>P</i>=0.960) between the three groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although there is no difference in effect of various repair materials on the incidence of complications, the effect of repair materials on postoperative complications of orbital blowout fractures should not be ignored.",

The cardiac pathological changes in these patients with COVID-19 have yet to be well described.<h4>Methods and results</h4>In an international multicentre study, cardiac tissue from the autopsies of 21 consecutive COVID-19 patients was assessed by cardiovascular pathologists. The presence of myocarditis, as defined by the presence of multiple foci of inflammation with associated myocyte injury, was determined, and the inflammatory cell composition analysed by immunohistochemistry. Other forms of acute myocyte injury and inflammation were also described, as well as coronary artery, endocardium, and pericardium involvement. Lymphocytic myocarditis was present in 3 (14%) of the cases. In two of these cases, the T lymphocytes were CD4 predominant and in one case the T lymphocytes were CD8 predominant. Increased interstitial macrophage infiltration was present in 18 (86%) of the cases. A mild pericarditis was present in four cases. Acute myocyte injury in the right ventricle, most probably due to strain/overload, was present in four cases. There was a non-significant trend toward higher serum troponin levels in the patients with myocarditis compared with those without myocarditis. Disrupted coronary artery plaques, coronary artery aneurysms, and large pulmonary emboli were not identified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In SARS-CoV-2 there are increased interstitial macrophages in a majority of the cases and multifocal lymphocytic myocarditis in a small fraction of the cases. Other forms of myocardial injury are also present in these patients. The macrophage infiltration may reflect underlying diseases rather than COVID-19.",https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-pdf/41/39/3827/46627204/ehaa664.pdf

Previously we showed that mutations in the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits are responsible for PHA. In this study we examined four independent probands with multisystem PHA, three of whom were born to consanguineous parents. In our search for mutations we also determined the complete coding sequences of each of the three genes encoding alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits in individuals representing different ethnic groups. Our analyses revealed the following homozygous mutations in three probands: 1) insertion of a T in exon 8 of the alpha ENaC gene that causes a frameshift error at Tyr(447) and leads to a premature stop codon at K459 in a Pakistani patient; 2) R508stop mutation in exon 11 of the alpha ENaC gene in an Indian patient; and 3) a splice site mutation in intron 12 of the beta ENaC gene (1669 + 1 g-->a) in a Scottish patient. The parents were heterozygous for the latter two mutations. The second mutation was previously observed in an Iranian Jewish patient. Our sequencing of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coding sequences revealed some sequence variants, some of which may represent single nucleotide polymorphisms. The gamma-subunit protein sequence was completely conserved in the six subjects examined. The homozygous mutations identified in the alpha and beta ENaC genes should result in reduced or abolished ENaC activity in PHA patients, explaining the disease symptoms.",

Our purpose is to describe the most common metabolic patterns of tuberculomas by MR spectroscopy (MRS) with emphasis on potential specific markers.<h4>Methods</h4>Single-voxel MRS short echo time was performed in 13 cases of tuberculomas proven by histology and/or response to anti-mycobacterial therapy. For comparison MRS was also performed in 19 biopsy-proven malignant tumors (13 high-grade gliomas and six metastasis). Presence of metabolic peaks was assessed visually and categorical variables between groups were compared using chi-square. Metabolite ratios were compared using Mann-Whitney test and diagnostic accuracy of the metabolite ratios was compared using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Spectroscopic peaks representing lipids and glutamate/glutamine (Glx) as well as a peak at ∼3.8 ppm were well defined in 77% (10/13), 77% (10/13) and 69% (nine of 13) of tuberculomas, respectively. Lipid and Glx peaks were also present in most of the malignant lesions, 79% (15/19) and 74% (14/19) respectively. However, a peak at ∼3.8 ppm was present in only 10% (two of 19) of the tumor cases (p < 0.001). Higher Cho/Cr and mI/Cr ratios helped discriminate malignant lesions with an area under the ROC curve of 0.86 (SE: 0.078, p < 0.002, CI: 0.7-1) and 0.8 (SE: 0.1, p < 0.009, CI: 0.6-1), respectively. Threshold values between 1.7-1.9 for Cho/Cr and 0.8-0.9 for mI/Cr provided high specificity (91% for both metabolites) and adequate sensitivity (75% and 80%, respectively) for discrimination of malignant lesions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A singlet peak at ∼3.8 ppm is present in the majority of tuberculomas and absent in most malignant tumors, potentially a marker to differentiate these lesions. The assignment of the peak is difficult from our analysis; however, guanidinoacetate (Gua) is a possibility. Higher Cho/Cr and mI/Cr ratios should favor malignant lesions over tuberculomas. The presence of lipids and Glx is non-specific.",

They were then asked to examine the ductus venosus during the routine 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' scan. Each scan was assessed by an experienced sonographer and classified as being successful or unsuccessful (failure to obtain a waveform, poor quality image with contamination or wrong classification of the A-wave). Each sonographer performed a total of 300 examinations, the data were analyzed in 15 groups of 20 examinations and in each group the percentage of unsuccessful examinations was calculated.<h4>Results</h4>In the total 3000 cases examined by the 10 sonographers there were 2849 (95.0%) successful examinations and 151 unsuccessful, including 104 failures to obtain a waveform, 30 cases where the quality of the image was considered to be inadequate and 17 cases in which the classification of the A-wave was wrong. The overall frequency of unsuccessful examinations decreased significantly with the number of scans carried out (r = 0.982, P < 0.0001). The sonographers required an average of 80 examinations before they could successfully examine the ductus in at least 19 of a group of 20 scans. Although one of the 10 trainees achieved this standard within the first block of 20 scans some of the sonographers required training in 100 cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Competence in Doppler assessment of the ductus venosus is achieved only after extensive supervised training.",

The identification of a homozygous truncating mutation in the M-line part of titin prompted us to sequence this region in 2 additional patients presenting similar clinical and biochemical characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>The 3 patients shared similar features: coexistence of limb-girdle weakness and early-onset diffuse joint contractures without cardiomyopathy. The biopsies showed rimmed vacuoles, a dystrophic pattern, and secondary reduction in calpain 3. We identified a novel homozygous mutation in the exon Mex3 of the TTN gene in the first patient. At protein level, this mutation introduces a stop codon at the level of Mex3. Interestingly, we identified truncating mutations in both alleles in the same region of the TTN gene in patients from 2 additional families. Molecular protein analyses confirm loss of the C-ter part of titin.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study broadens the phenotype of titinopathies with the report of a new clinical entity with prominent contractures and no cardiac abnormality and where the recessive mutations lead to truncation of the M-line titin and secondary calpain 3 deficiency.",

The cases were collected from three centers that specialize in the use of pelvic ultrasound and had been examined between January 2007 and October 2018. Clinical data were obtained from the computer databases and all tumor images were assessed by two of the authors (D.J. and J.K.) to identify characteristic sonographic patterns. We compared the characteristics of tumors between women presenting with symptoms suspicious of urinary bladder malignancy and those without such symptoms.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty women with a confirmed diagnosis of urinary bladder malignancy on histological examination were included. Median age at diagnosis was 70.5 (range 36-88) years. The most common presenting symptom was postmenopausal bleeding, which was recorded in 18 (60%) women. Ten (33%) women had symptoms suspicious of bladder malignancy, of whom six had unexplained visible hematuria, three had unexplained recurrent urinary tract infections and one had dysuria and microhematuria. On histological examination, 23 (77%) women were diagnosed with primary bladder malignancy whilst seven (23%) had metastases in the bladder from other primary tumors. Out of 23 primary tumors, 21 (91%) were of urothelial origin (12 low grade and nine high grade). Most low-grade urothelial carcinomas appeared on ultrasound as irregular papillary growth (11/12, 92%) and were moderately to highly vascular on color Doppler examination (8/12, 67%). The ultrasound appearances of primary non-urothelial and metastatic tumors varied, without a clear common morphological tumor pattern. The tumors found in women with symptoms suggestive of bladder malignancy did not differ unequivocally from those detected in other women in terms of size, ultrasound morphology, vascularity or histological type.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Urinary bladder malignancies can be detected in patients undergoing transvaginal ultrasound examination for suspected gynecological problems. Primary urothelial cancers have a relatively uniform morphological pattern, whilst the appearances of other bladder malignancies are more variable. Copyright © 2019 ISUOG.

We used a novel approach by utilizing Swedish registers to assess metastatic spread in gastric cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide description of metastases in gastric cancer.<h4>Results</h4>The most common sites of metastasis were liver (in 48% of metastatic cancer patients), peritoneum (32%), lung (15%), and bone (12%). Metastases to the lung, nervous system, and bone were more frequent in cardia cancer and men, whereas non-cardia cancer more frequently metastasized within the peritoneum. Signet ring adenocarcinomas more frequently metastasized within the peritoneum, bone and ovaries, and less frequently to the lungs and liver compared with generic adenocarcinoma. The liver and the peritoneum were commonly single metastases while lung metastases occurred frequently together with liver metastases. The median survival in metastatic gastric cancer was 3 months, worst among those with bone and liver metastases (2 months).<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 7,559 patients with gastric cancer were identified. Metastatic patterns and survival depending on sex, age, stage, anatomical location (cardia and non-cardia), and histological type were assessed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The patterns of metastasis differ notably depending on histological type. Cardia cancer exhibits a completely different metastatic behavior than non-cardia cancer. Awareness of the differing patterns may guide in tailored diagnosis of metastases. Survivors from cardia cancer would benefit from increased surveillance of extraperitoneal metastases. Bone metastases should be considered in patients with signet ring adenocarcinoma if symptoms emerge.",http://www.oncotarget.com/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=download&path%5B%5D=10740&path%5B%5D=34002

Induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1), an antiapoptotic BCL2 family member, is commonly upregulated in AML cells and is often a primary mode of resistance to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Here, we describe VU661013, a novel, potent, selective MCL1 inhibitor that destabilizes BIM/MCL1 association, leads to apoptosis in AML, and is active in venetoclax-resistant cells and patient-derived xenografts. In addition, VU661013 was safely combined with venetoclax for synergy in murine models of AML. Importantly, BH3 profiling of patient samples and drug-sensitivity testing <i>ex vivo</i> accurately predicted cellular responses to selective inhibitors of MCL1 or BCL2 and showed benefit of the combination. Taken together, these data suggest a strategy of rationally using BCL2 and MCL1 inhibitors in sequence or in combination in AML clinical trials. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting antiapoptotic proteins in AML is a key therapeutic strategy, and MCL1 is a critical antiapoptotic oncoprotein. Armed with novel MCL1 inhibitors and the potent BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, it may be possible to selectively induce apoptosis by combining or thoughtfully sequencing these inhibitors based on a rational evaluation of AML.<i>See related commentary by Leber et al., p. 1511</i>.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1494</i>.",

We can suppose that BVDV may have modulated the BCoV infection exacerbating the long viral excretion, as well as favoring the onset of mutations in the genome of BCoV detected in fecal samples at T21. An extensive study was performed to verify if the selective pressure in the S gene could be a natural mode of variation of BCoV, providing data for the identification of new epidemic strains, genotypes or recombinant <i>betacoronaviruses</i>.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/12/3350/pdf?version=1637822411

Investigators have recently discovered disturbances in the ""future self"" in semantic dementia. We report a 63-year-old man with semantic dementia who was hospitalized after suicide attempts that he attributed to his loss of a sense of future self. He complained of a decreased sense of being human, because he could not imagine doing things in the future that he had done in the past. Suicidal thinking and inability to place himself in future tasks persisted despite resolution of depression. Clinical assessment revealed a crossmodal loss of semantic knowledge, and neuroimaging showed bilateral anterior temporal atrophy and hypometabolism. On specific tests of autobiographical memory, identity, attribute knowledge, and future projection, the patient could return to the past and visualize himself in familiar scenarios, but he could not visualize himself even passively in these scenarios in the future. His future self was impaired not from seeing himself disabled; it was from an absence of semantic details of potential experiences, associated with impaired semantic autobiographical memory. His self-representations were concrete and specific rather than abstract and generalizable. This patient and recent publications indicate that semantic dementia impairs the ability to imagine oneself as capable in the future, leading some patients to suicidal behavior. We discuss possible mechanisms for these findings, including the potential role of abstract construals for future thinking.",

Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to determine which risk factors were associated with patient delay (>30 days) and 'extreme'  patient delay (>90 days).<h4>Results</h4>The percentage of patients who sought treatment after 30 and 90 days was respectively 51.8% (95%CI 45.7-57.9) and 23.5% (95%CI 18.6-29.0). The strongest factors associated with patient delay and 'extreme' patient delay was when  the first choice for treatment was a non-government health facility and in 30-39-year-olds. 'Extreme' patient delay was also weakly associated, among other factors, with comorbidity and livestock ownership.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Delay and extreme delay in seeking treatment were  more common when the usual first treatment choice was a non-government health facility. Continuous health education on TB aimed at raising awareness and correcting misconceptions is needed, particularly among those who use non-government facilities.",
873,32252114,Combined Use of CytoSorb and ECMO in Patients with Severe Pneumogenic Sepsis.,10.1055/s-0040-1708479,"Akil A, Ziegeler S, Reichelt J, Rehers S, Abdalla O, Semik M, Fischer S.",2021,The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,"<h4>Background</h4>High morbidity and mortality are frequently reported in intensive care patients suffering from severe sepsis with systemic inflammation. With the development of severe respiratory failure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is often required. In this study, cytokine adsorption therapy in combination with ECMO is applied in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe pneumogenic sepsis. The efficacy of this therapy is evaluated compared with a historical cohort without hemoadsorption therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>Between January and May 2018, combined high-flow venovenous ECMO and CytoSorb therapy (CytoSorb filter connected to ECMO circuit) was applied in patients (<i>n</i> = 13) with pneumogenic sepsis and ARDS. These patients were prospectively included (CytoSorb group). Data from patients (<i>n</i> = 7) with pneumogenic sepsis and ECMO therapy were retrospectively analyzed (control group).<h4>Results</h4>All patients survived in the CytoSorb group, where the 30-day mortality rate reached 57% in the control group. After CytoSorb therapy, we instantly observed a significant reduction in procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared with the control group. Within 48 hours, the initial high doses of catecholamine could be weaned off only in the CytoSorb group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results indicate that CytoSorb in combination with ECMO is an effective therapy to prevent escalation of sepsis with rapid weaning off high-dose catecholamine infusions and quick reduction in PCT and CRP levels. Optimal timing of immunomodulatory therapy and impact on ECMO-related inflammation still need to be furtherly investigated.",

Oncology,"<h4>Background</h4>Although international guidelines support the administration of hormone therapies with or without targeted therapies in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, upfront use of chemotherapy remains common even in the absence of visceral crisis. Because first-line or second-line treatments, or both, based on chemotherapy and on hormone therapy have been scarcely investigated in head-to-head randomised controlled trials, we aimed to compare these two different approaches.<h4>Methods</h4>We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis with a systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and online archives of the most relevant international oncology conferences. We included all phase 2 and 3 randomised controlled trials investigating chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies and hormone therapies with or without targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or both, in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017. Additional recently published randomised controlled trials relevant to the topic were also subsequently added. No language restrictions were adopted for our search. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was done to compare hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (the primary outcome), and to compare odds ratios (ORs) for the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (the secondary outcome). All treatments were compared to anastrozole and to palbociclib plus letrozole. This study is registered in the Open Science Framework online public database, registration DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/496VR.<h4>Findings</h4>We identified 2689 published results and 140 studies (comprising 50 029 patients) were included in the analysis. Palbociclib plus letrozole (HR 0·42; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0·25-0·70), ribociclib plus letrozole (0·43; 0·24-0·77), abemaciclib plus anastrozole or letrozole (0·42; 0·23-0·76), palbociclib plus fulvestrant (0·37; 0·23-0·59), ribociclib plus fulvestrant (0·48; 0·31-0·74), abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (0·44; 0·28-0·70), everolimus plus exemestane (0·42; 0·28-0·67), and, in patients with a PIK3CA mutation, alpelisib plus fulvestrant (0·39; 0·22-0·66), and several chemotherapy-based regimens, including anthracycline and taxane-containing regimens, were associated with better progression-free survival than was anastrozole alone. No chemotherapy or hormone therapy regimen was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole for progression-free survival. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was the only clinically relevant regimen that was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (OR 8·95; 95% CrI 1·03-76·92).<h4>Interpretation</h4>In the first-line or second-line setting, CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies are better than standard hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Moreover, no chemotherapy regimen with or without targeted therapy is significantly better than CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Our data support treatment guideline recommendations involving the new combinations of hormone therapies plus targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or in both settings, in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.<h4>Funding</h4>None.",

There are no published estimates of open neurovascular case volumes during residency or Committee on Advanced Subspecialty Training (CAST) accredited fellowships.<h4>Methods</h4>Case volumes from residency programs submitting data for CAST accredited fellowship applications were collected and analyzed. The study period covered the academic years of 2013-2016. Case index volumes were calculated to provide an estimate of total volume of cases each trainee participated in a given year. The case index volume was defined as the total volume of cases per year divided by the total training complement.<h4>Results</h4>Over the study period, institutional data from 46 programs were available. Of those programs, 9 programs had CAST accredited open cerebrovascular fellowships. Across all 46 programs, the median number of vascular cases was 246 (interquartile range [IQR]: 148-340), whereas the median number of open vascular cases was 105 (IQR: 67-152). The median number of open aneurysm cases among programs with CAST cerebrovascular fellowships was 80 (IQR: 54-103) and among programs without CAST cerebrovascular fellowships was 34 (IQR: 24-63). The median open aneurysm case index volume for trainees at programs with and without CAST cerebrovascular fellowships was 23 (IQR: 14-29) and 19 (IQR: 11-24).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Strong neurovascular training can be obtained through dedication and planning. Completion of a CAST accredited cerebrovascular fellowship will often more than double aneurysm case exposure of trainees.",

Because of the rarity and various manifestations of ACTs, patients of ACTs are not easily diagnosed. Some patients were misdiagnosed before surgery.<h4>Objective</h4>Identify the clinical, laboratorial, imaging and histopathological characteristics of adrenocortical tumors in children. Compare adrenalcortical adenoma with carcinoma.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review of 34 identified patients who were younger than 15 years old with histologic confirmation of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) or adenomas from 1991 to 2010.<h4>Results</h4>In these 34 patients, 19 were adrenocortical adenoma (ACA) and 15 were ACC. The median age at diagnosis was 3.33 years (range, 0-16 years), and 70.6% of the patients were younger than five years. Girls slightly predominated over boys (1.4:1). For endocrine abnormality, 14 patients had isolated precocious puberty, five patients had isolated Cushing syndrome, 10 patients had precocious puberty plus Cushing syndrome, and five patients did not have any symptoms. The most frequent findings in laboratory tests were disturbance of the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion (93.8%), followed by elevated serum level of testosterone (89.7%). Only 3.8% of ultrasound diagnosis and 12.1% of computed tomography (CT) diagnosis were consistent with pathologic diagnosis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Different from those in adult, the most frequent presentation in children with ACTs is peripheral precocious puberty with or without Cushing syndrome, and isolated Cushing syndrome. Few present with non-functional local mass. Laboratory tests usually reveal the discordantly elevated serum levels of sexual corticosteroid hormones, change of diurnal rhythm of cortisol or increase of morning cortisol. The differentiation of malignant from benign tumor cannot merely depend on imaging. Final diagnosis relies on comprehensive evaluation of clinical manifestations, laboratory data, imaging and pathology.",

We show here that the complete sequence of the human titin gene contains 363 exons, which together code for 38 138 residues (4200 kDa). In its central I-band region, 47 novel PEVK exons were found, which contribute to titin's extensible spring properties. Additionally, 3 unique I-band titin exons were identified (named novex-1 to -3). Novex-3 functions as an alternative titin C-terminus. The novex-3 titin isoform is approximately 700 kDa in size and spans from Z1-Z2 (titin's N-terminus) to novex-3 (C-terminal exon). Novex-3 titin specifically interacts with obscurin, a 721-kDa myofibrillar protein composed of 57 Ig/FN3 domains, followed by one IQ, SH3, DH, and a PH domain at its C-terminus. The obscurin domains Ig48/Ig49 bind to novex-3 titin and target to the Z-line region when expressed as a GFP fusion protein in live cardiac myocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy detected the C-terminal Ig48/Ig49 obscurin epitope near the Z-line edge. The distance from the Z-line varied with sarcomere length, suggesting that the novex-3 titin/obscurin complex forms an elastic Z-disc to I-band linking system. This system could link together calcium-dependent, SH3-, and GTPase-regulated signaling pathways in close proximity to the Z-disc, a structure increasingly implicated in the restructuring of sarcomeres during cardiomyopathies.",

Six patients died within three months of diagnosis; one patient was lost to follow up. Twelve of the remaining 33 patients had suffered from limited IVC thrombosis; during follow up (for up to nine years) none showed persisting caval obstruction (successful thrombolysis, n = 2; spontaneous recanalisation, n = 10). The remaining 21 patients presented with extensive IVC thrombosis. During follow up (for up to 18 years) complete restitution was found in only four cases (one thrombolysis, two surgery, one spontaneous recanalisation). Persisting iliac and/or caval venous obstruction occurred in 17 patients, including six with thrombolysis. Varicose veins were found in 12, and post-thrombotic syndrome in seven of these cases. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, 30% of patients with persisting venous disease will develop post-thrombotic syndrome within 10 years of the thrombotic event.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Infants and children with extensive IVC thrombosis are at high risk for persisting venous disease and serious long term complications. Prospective trials are urgently needed to establish effective treatment strategies and to improve long term prognosis. Central venous catheters, contributing to IVC thrombosis in the majority of cases reported here, should be inserted only if essential.",

Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non-intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic.<h4>Methods</h4>This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City. We included patients suspected of having COVID-19 with hypoxia on arrival. A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO<sub>2</sub> . SpO<sub>2</sub> measurements were recorded at triage and after 5 minutes of proning. Supplemental oxygenation methods included non-rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula. We also characterized post-proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty patients were included. Overall, the median SpO<sub>2</sub> at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85). After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90). After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO<sub>2</sub> improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95). Comparison of the pre- to post-median by the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test yielded P = 0.001. Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Awake early self-proning in the emergency department demonstrated improved oxygen saturation in our COVID-19 positive patients. Further studies are needed to support causality and determine the effect of proning on disease severity and mortality.",

Inadequate response to current therapeutic interventions constitutes a challenging clinical problem. A better understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms could improve psychotherapeutic and drug treatment strategies.<h4>Method</h4>A review highlighting the current state of brain imaging in eating disorders related to the anxiety and pathological fear learning model of anorexia nervosa (AN) and the impulsivity model of binge eating in bulimia nervosa (BN).<h4>Results</h4>Available neuroimaging studies in patients with acute AN primarily suggest a hyper-responsive emotional and fear network to food, but not necessarily to eating disorder-unrelated, salient stimuli. Furthermore, patients with AN show decreased activation in the ventral fronto-striatal circuits during the performance of a cognitive flexibility task. Results in patients with BN primarily suggest a hypo-responsive reward system to food stimuli, especially to taste reward. Additionally, patients with BN exhibit impaired brain activation in the inhibitory control network during the performance of general response-inhibition tasks.<h4>Discussion</h4>Anxiety and pathological fear learning may lead to conditioned neural stimulus-response patterns to food stimuli and increased cognitive rigidity, which could account for the phobic avoidance of food intake in patients with acute AN. However, further neurobiological studies are required to investigate pathological fear learning in patients with AN. Patients with BN may binge eat to compensate for a hypo-responsive reward system. The impaired brain activation in the inhibitory control network may facilitate the loss of control over food intake in patients with BN.",

Headache of sudden and severe onset is the main symptom, associated with visual disturbances or ocular palsy. Signs of meningeal irritation or altered consciousness may complicate the diagnosis. Corticotropic deficiency (secondary adrenal failure) may be life-threatening if untreated. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirm the diagnosis by revealing a pituitary tumour with haemorrhagic and/or necrotic components: CT is most useful in the acute setting (24 - 48 h), MRI is useful for identifying blood components in the subacute setting (4 days to 1 month). Owing to the highly variable course of this syndrome and the limited individual experience, the optimal management of acute pituitary apoplexy is controversial. Some authors advocate early transphenoidal surgical decompression for all patients, whereas others adopt a more conservative approach for selected patients (those without visual acuity or field defects and with normal consciousness).

This study is to set up basic parameters of targeted NGS for clinical diagnosis and to understand advantage of targeted NGS in comparison with the conventional methods of molecular diagnosis.<h4>Methods</h4>Genomic DNA from 1000 Genomes Project and DNA from cancer cell lines have been used to establish the basic parameters for targeted NGS. The following confirmation was conducted by clinical samples. The multiple variants tested by amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were evaluated by targeted NGS to determine the sensitivity. Furthermore, the multiple variants detected by targeted NGS were confirmed by current conventional methods to elucidate the specificity.<h4>Results</h4>At sequencing depth of 500×, the maximal sensitivities on detecting single nucletic variances (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (Indels) can reach 99% and 98.7% respectively, and in 20% of cancer cells, CNV detection can reach to the maximal level. The following confirmation of the sensitivity and specificity was conducted by a large cohort of clinical samples. For SNV and indel detection in clinical samples, targeted NGS can identify all hotspot mutations with 100% sensitivity and specificity. On ALK fusion detection, about 86% IHC-identified cases could be identified by targeted NGS and all ALK fusion detected by targeted NGS were confirmed by IHC. For HER2-amplification, 14 HER2-amplification cases identified by target NGS were all confirmed by FISH and about 93.3% of Her-2 IHC (3+) cases were identified by targeted NGS. Finally, the targeted NGS platform developed here has accurately detected EGFR hotspot mutations in 215 NSCLC patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DNA from cancer cell lines is better than standard DNA as a reference to establish basic parameters for targeted NGS. Comparison of the conventional methods using a large cohort of patient samples confirmed the high preformance of targeted NGS on detecting DNA alterations.",https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13046-017-0591-4

This study outlines a detailed and standardized laboratory protocol for preparation of a color-perfused human placenta model. Survey-based validation of the model is also reported herein.<h4>Methods</h4>The protocol involved cleaning and cannulation of the umbilical vein and arteries, irrigation with heparin, and storage at 3°C or freezing at -18°C. Before use, arteries were perfused with carmine/cochineal, and veins were perfused with methylthioninium chloride. A questionnaire with 5 questions was administered to 40 participants among attending or resident neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, and maxillofacial surgeons on 4 consecutive microsurgical courses to assess the reliability of the placenta model. Trainees were divided into 3 groups based on their experience. A χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to identify differences between groups.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-two placentas were considered appropriate for training and were successfully perfused with dyes. Thirty-three participants completed the questionnaire, of which most, especially advanced and intermediate participants, indicated the placenta as a valuable, accurate, and reproducible model. No differences were observed among the groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The human placenta is an excellent tool for vascular microneurosurgery laboratory training. Color perfusion enhances the reliability of this model, which was validated by most surgeons, regardless of their experience.",

Dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with craving. We investigated whether stimulation of the DLPFC reduces food craving in people with a bulimic-type eating disorder.<h4>Methods</h4>Thirty-eight people with bulimic-type eating disorders were randomly allocated to receive one session of real or sham high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left DLPFC in a double-blind procedure. Outcome measures included self-reported food craving immediately after the stimulation session and frequency of bingeing over a 24-hour follow-up period.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with sham control, real rTMS was associated with decreased self-reported urge to eat and fewer binge-eating episodes over the 24 hours following stimulation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>High-frequency rTMS of the left DLPFC lowers cue-induced food cravings in people with a bulimic eating disorder and may reduce binge eating. These results provide a rationale for exploring rTMS as a treatment for bulimic eating disorders.",

After early reports of myocarditis during adverse events monitoring, the Israeli Ministry of Health initiated active surveillance.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively reviewed data obtained from December 20, 2020, to May 31, 2021, regarding all cases of myocarditis and categorized the information using the Brighton Collaboration definition. We analyzed the occurrence of myocarditis by computing the risk difference for the comparison of the incidence after the first and second vaccine doses (21 days apart); by calculating the standardized incidence ratio of the observed-to-expected incidence within 21 days after the first dose and 30 days after the second dose, independent of certainty of diagnosis; and by calculating the rate ratio 30 days after the second dose as compared with unvaccinated persons.<h4>Results</h4>Among 304 persons with symptoms of myocarditis, 21 had received an alternative diagnosis. Of the remaining 283 cases, 142 occurred after receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine; of these cases, 136 diagnoses were definitive or probable. The clinical presentation was judged to be mild in 129 recipients (95%); one fulminant case was fatal. The overall risk difference between the first and second doses was 1.76 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 2.19), with the largest difference among male recipients between the ages of 16 and 19 years (difference, 13.73 per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.11 to 19.46). As compared with the expected incidence based on historical data, the standardized incidence ratio was 5.34 (95% CI, 4.48 to 6.40) and was highest after the second dose in male recipients between the ages of 16 and 19 years (13.60; 95% CI, 9.30 to 19.20). The rate ratio 30 days after the second vaccine dose in fully vaccinated recipients, as compared with unvaccinated persons, was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 5.02); the rate ratio was again highest in male recipients between the ages of 16 and 19 years (8.96; 95% CI, 4.50 to 17.83), with a ratio of 1 in 6637.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The incidence of myocarditis, although low, increased after the receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine, particularly after the second dose among young male recipients.

In this study, neuropsychological performance was compared among depressed patients with at least one prior suicide attempt of high lethality, depressed patients with low-lethality prior attempts, depressed patients with no prior suicide attempts, and nonpatients.<h4>Method</h4>Fifty unmedicated patients in a major depressive episode (21 with no history of suicide attempts and 14 and 15 patients with previous attempts of low and high lethality, respectively) and 22 nonpatients were assessed. Groups were comparable in age, education, occupational level, and estimated premorbid intelligence. The neuropsychological battery produced scores within five composite domains: general intellectual functioning (current), motor functioning, attention, memory, and executive functioning.<h4>Results</h4>Patients whose prior suicide attempts were of high lethality performed significantly worse than all groups on tests of executive functioning and were the only group to perform significantly worse than nonpatients on tests of general intellectual functioning, attention, and memory. A discriminant function analysis revealed two prominent dimensions in the data: one that discriminated high-lethality suicide attempters from all other groups (primarily associated with performance on tests of executive functioning) and another that discriminated all depressed patient groups from nonpatients (associated with performance on measures of attention and memory). For the patients with high-lethality prior suicide attempts, deficits did not appear to reflect diffuse brain damage from past attempts, since the results of tests commonly affected by diffuse injury were not selectively impaired.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Neuropsychological deficits in depressed patients with high-lethality prior suicide attempts suggest impairment of executive functioning beyond that typically found in major depression. This more extensive neuropsychological impairment in the context of depression may be a risk factor for severe suicide attempts.",

In a double masked, randomised, crossover design, each subject received orally on separate days either 20 mg of 5-isosorbide mononitrate (ISMO) or placebo. Ch flow and ON flow were determined monocularly at baseline and 1 hour after dosing. In the last six subjects, additional measurements were obtained at 3 hours. Mean arterial blood pressure (BPm), heart rate, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were monitored, and ocular perfusion pressure (PP) was estimated.<h4>Results</h4>No significant changes in ON flow, PP, IOP, or BPm were observed following placebo. Following ISMO, ON flow increased from baseline by 19.8% (SEM 9.3%) at 1 hour (paired t test, p = 0.058) and by 33.1% (7.5%) at 3 hours (p = 0.007).

This study was set up to determine the incidence of brain metastases and to investigate the outcome following multimodal treatment in 70 patients with LCNEC.<h4>Methods</h4>Seventy patients with histologically confirmed LCNEC were treated at the University Hospital of Heidelberg between 2001 and 2014. Data were collected retrospectively. Al most all patients received thoracic surgery as initial treatment (94 %). Chemotherapy was administered in 32 patients as part of the initial treatment. Fourteen patients were treated with adjuvant or definitive thoracic radiotherapy according to NSCLC protocols. Cranial radiotherapy due to brain metastases, mostly given as whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), was received by fourteen patients. Statistical analysis was performed using the long-rank test and the Kaplan-Meier method.<h4>Results</h4>Without PCI, the detected rate for brain metastases was 25 % after a median follow-up time of 23.4 months, which is comparable to NSCLC patients in general.

This paper explores the mechanisms underlying affective-prosodic deficits following left and right brain damage by testing the ability of subjects to repeat and comprehend affective prosody under progressively reduced verbal-articulatory conditions. The results demonstrate that reducing verbal-articulatory conditions robustly improves the performance of left but not right brain damaged patients, a finding that supports the supposition that affective prosody is strongly lateralized to the right hemisphere. However, the performance of left brain damaged patients was not correlated to the presence, severity, or type of aphasic deficit(s). Based on functional-anatomic correlations for spontaneous affective prosody and affective-prosodic repetition, deep white matter lesions located below the supplementary motor area that disrupt interhemispheric connections coursing through the mid-rostral corpus callosum may contribute to affective-prosodic deficits that are both additive and independent of any aphasic deficits. In light of these and other findings, various anatomical, functional, and maturational hierarchic relationships between the affective-prosodic and verbal-linguistic aspects of language are posited in order to help further explain discrepancies that exist in the literature regarding the neurology of affective prosody.",

The most common clinical presentation is asymptomatic hematuria, which should prompt evaluation with cystoscopy, renal function testing, and upper urinary tract imaging in adults 35 years and older and in those with irritative voiding symptoms, risk factors for bladder cancer, or gross hematuria at any age. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor allows for definitive diagnosis, staging, and primary treatment. Non-muscle-invasive disease is treated with transurethral resection, most often followed by intravesical bacille Calmette-Guérin or intravesical chemotherapy. Bladder cancer that invades the muscle layer is typically treated with radical cystectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy because of higher rates of progression and recurrence. No major organization recommends screening asymptomatic adults for bladder cancer, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening.",

Rates of self-harm may be increased in mild dementia and are higher before than after predictive testing for Huntington's disease. Overall, the risk of suicide in dementia appears to be the same or less than that of the age-matched general population but is increased soon after diagnosis, in patients diagnosed with dementia during hospitalization and in Huntington's disease. Putative risk factors for suicide in dementia include depression, hopelessness, mild cognitive impairment, preserved insight, younger age and failure to respond to anti-dementia drugs. Large, good quality prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Further research should be undertaken to examine how rates of suicide and self-harm change during the course of the illness and vary according to the specific sub-type of dementia.",

Relapsed or refractory disease is generally considered incurable by conventional therapeutic approaches, although durable responses can be achieved with novel monoclonal antibodies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) may have potential value by inducing graft vs-lymphoma (GvL) effects, but there is currently no consensus regarding the timing of alloHSCT or type of conditioning regimen. Here we present the case of a male patient who achieved a complete remission (CR) of primary refractory SS after non-myeloablative alloHSCT. Patient: Two years prior to HSCT, the patient had been refractory to CHOEP-based chemotherapy, interferon, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), and bexarotene. Directly prior to alloHSCT brentuximab-vedotin (BV) was applied resulting in a partial remission of the skin compartment and overall in a stable disease. Prior to HSCT, flow cytometry of the bone marrow and peripheral blood showed an infiltration with T-cells positive for CD5, CD4, low CD3, low CD2 and negative for CD7, CD38, HLA-DR and CD8. The trephine biopsy showed a 7% infiltration of SS cells. The CD4:CD8 ratio in peripheral blood (pb) was massively increased at 76.67, with 63.5% of white blood cells expressing a SS immune phenotype. The conditioning regimen included 30 mg/m2 fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from day-1 and mycophenolate mofetil from day 0. The patient received 6.55x106 CD34+ cells and 1.11x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight. Bone marrow evaluation on day 28 still showed persistent SS cells by flow cytometry. After tapering immunosuppression until day 169, the CD4:CD8 ratio in pb normalized. CR was documented on day 169 after alloHSCT and is now ongoing for almost 3 years after alloHSCT. Conclusions: We confirm that an alloHSCT can be a curative option for refractory patients with SS. The achievement of a CR after tapering the immunosuppressive therapy indicates a significant role of the GvL effect. In present treatment algorithms for patients with SS, the timing of an alloHSCT and the intensity of conditioning should be further explored.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.749691/pdf

We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would decrease mortality among patients with septic shock who were being treated with conventional (catecholamine) vasopressors.<h4>Methods</h4>In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 microg of norepinephrine per minute to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) or norepinephrine (5 to 15 microg per minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary end point was the mortality rate 28 days after the start of infusions.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 778 patients underwent randomization, were infused with the study drug (396 patients received vasopressin, and 382 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00). In the prospectively defined stratum of less severe septic shock, the mortality rate was lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group at 28 days (26.5% vs. 35.7%, P=0.05); in the stratum of more severe septic shock, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (44.0% and 42.5%, respectively; P=0.76). A test for heterogeneity between these two study strata was not significant (P=0.10).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Low-dose vasopressin did not reduce mortality rates as compared with norepinephrine among patients with septic shock who were treated with catecholamine vasopressors.

We endeavoured to evaluate the relationship between ABCDEF bundle performance and patient-centered outcomes in critical care.<h4>Design</h4>Prospective, multicenter, cohort study from a national quality improvement collaborative.<h4>Setting</h4>68 academic, community, and federal ICUs collected data during a 20-month period.<h4>Patients</h4>15,226 adults with at least one ICU day.<h4>Interventions</h4>We defined ABCDEF bundle performance (our main exposure) in two ways: 1) complete performance (patient received every eligible bundle element on any given day) and 2) proportional performance (percentage of eligible bundle elements performed on any given day). We explored the association between complete and proportional ABCDEF bundle performance and three sets of outcomes: patient-related (mortality, ICU and hospital discharge), symptom-related (mechanical ventilation, coma, delirium, pain, restraint use), and system-related (ICU readmission, discharge destination). All models were adjusted for a minimum of 18 a priori determined potential confounders.<h4>Measurements and results</h4>Complete ABCDEF bundle performance was associated with lower likelihood of seven outcomes: hospital death within 7 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.32; CI, 0.17-0.62), next-day mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.28; CI, 0.22-0.36), coma (AOR, 0.35; CI, 0.22-0.56), delirium (AOR, 0.60; CI, 0.49-0.72), physical restraint use (AOR, 0.37; CI, 0.30-0.46), ICU readmission (AOR, 0.54; CI, 0.37-0.79), and discharge to a facility other than home (AOR, 0.64; CI, 0.51-0.80). There was a consistent dose-response relationship between higher proportional bundle performance and improvements in each of the above-mentioned clinical outcomes (all p < 0.002). Significant pain was more frequently reported as bundle performance proportionally increased (p = 0.0001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>ABCDEF bundle performance showed significant and clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes including survival, mechanical ventilation use, coma, delirium, restraint-free care, ICU readmissions, and post-ICU discharge disposition.",

Although rare, fulminant and fatal toxic effects may complicate these otherwise transformative therapies; characterizing these events requires integration of global data.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the spectrum, timing, and clinical features of fatal ICI-associated toxic effects.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>We retrospectively queried a World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance database (Vigilyze) comprising more than 16 000 000 adverse drug reactions, and records from 7 academic centers. We performed a meta-analysis of published trials of anti-programmed death-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) to evaluate their incidence using data from large academic medical centers, global WHO pharmacovigilance data, and all published ICI clinical trials of patients with cancer treated with ICIs internationally.<h4>Exposures</h4>Anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab or tremelimumab), anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab), or anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab).<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Timing, spectrum, outcomes, and incidence of ICI-associated toxic effects.<h4>Results</h4>Internationally, 613 fatal ICI toxic events were reported from 2009 through January 2018 in Vigilyze. The spectrum differed widely between regimens: in a total of 193 anti-CTLA-4 deaths, most were usually from colitis (135 [70%]), whereas anti-PD-1/PD-L1-related fatalities were often from pneumonitis (333 [35%]), hepatitis (115 [22%]), and neurotoxic effects (50 [15%]). Combination PD-1/CTLA-4 deaths were frequently from colitis (32 [37%]) and myocarditis (22 [25%]). Fatal toxic effects typically occurred early after therapy initiation for combination therapy, anti-PD-1, and ipilimumab monotherapy (median 14.5, 40, and 40 days, respectively). Myocarditis had the highest fatality rate (52 [39.7%] of 131 reported cases), whereas endocrine events and colitis had only 2% to 5% reported fatalities; 10% to 17% of other organ-system toxic effects reported had fatal outcomes. Retrospective review of 3545 patients treated with ICIs from 7 academic centers revealed 0.6% fatality rates; cardiac and neurologic events were especially prominent (43%). Median time from symptom onset to death was 32 days. A meta-analysis of 112 trials involving 19 217 patients showed toxicity-related fatality rates of 0.36% (anti-PD-1), 0.38% (anti-PD-L1), 1.08% (anti-CTLA-4), and 1.23% (PD-1/PD-L1 plus CTLA-4).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>In the largest evaluation of fatal ICI-associated toxic effects published to date to our knowledge, we observed early onset of death with varied causes and frequencies depending on therapeutic regimen.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo).

In ICU, hyperbilirubinemia is an independent factor that influences patients' morbidity and mortality. Jaundice can reflect the course of disease or be caused by treatment (e.g. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), thus can be difficult to differentiate. Sepsis was also associated with development of jaundice secondary to intrahepatic cholestasis. Prolonged cholestasis should be addressed to avoid liver damage. The patient with diagnosis of septic shock and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome was retrieved to our hospital for ECMO. Three days after initiation of ECMO, the patient developed jaundice, with increase of bilirubin, Gamma-glutamyltransferase and Alkaline phosphatase, without elevation of alanine aminotransferase and INR. Although ECMO was stopped, bilirubin serum levels were increasing, reaching the peak of 18.41 mg/dL of total and 15.67 mg/dL of direct bilirubin. Abdominal computed tomography showed homogeneous liver and non-dilated bile ducts. Viral hepatitis was excluded. CIOMS/RUCAM score was 0. Sepsis-related cholestasis was diagnosed. Despite cessation of sedation, the patient remained unconscious. Hemoadsorption therapy was initiated due to prolonged high levels of conjugated bilirubin. After 48 h of CytoSorb treatment, total bilirubin level was decreased to 2.4 mg/dL, the patient regained spontaneous eyes opening and could be transferred to regional hospital. Hyperbilirubinemia did not return in 3 months. Sepsis-related cholestasis is a diagnosis of exclusion that should be considered in case of jaundice in critically ill patients.

Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1) is a primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance characterized in the newborn by salt wasting, hyperkalemia, and failure to thrive. Inactivating mutations of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; NR3C2) are responsible for autosomal dominant and some sporadic cases of PHA1. The question as to whether other genes may be involved in the disease is of major importance because of the potential life-threatening character of the disease, the potential cardiovascular effects of compensatory aldosterone excess, and the role of the mineralocorticoid system in human hypertension. We present the first comprehensive study seeking nucleotide substitutions in coding regions, intron-exon junctions, and untranslated exons, as well as for large deletions. A total of 22 MR gene abnormalities were found in 33 patients. We demonstrate that MR mutations are extremely frequent in PHA1 patients classified according to aldosterone and potassium levels and give indications for accurate clinical and biological investigation. In our study the possibility of a genocopy exists in three PHA1 kindreds. The other patients without MR mutations might have different diseases resembling to PHA1 in the neonatal period, which could be identified by extensive clinical and functional exploration.",

Bladder cancer ranges from unaggressive and usually noninvasive tumors that recur and commit patients to long-term invasive surveillance, to aggressive and invasive tumors with high disease-specific mortality.<h4>Observations</h4>Advanced age, male sex, and cigarette smoking contribute to the development of bladder cancer. Bladder tumors can present with gross or microscopic hematuria, which is evaluated with cystoscopy and upper tract imaging depending on the degree of hematuria and risk of malignancy. Non-muscle-invasive tumors are treated with endoscopic resection and adjuvant intravesical therapy, depending on the risk classification. Enhanced cystoscopy includes technology used to improve the detection of tumors and can reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive tumors that do not respond to adjuvant therapy with the standard-of-care immunotherapy, bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), constitute a challenging patient population to manage and many alternative therapies are being studied. For patients with muscle-invasive disease, more aggressive therapy with radical cystectomy and urinary diversion or trimodal therapy with maximal endoscopic resection, radiosensitizing chemotherapy, and radiation is warranted to curb the risk of metastasis and disease-specific mortality. Treatment of patients with advanced disease is undergoing rapid changes as immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and antibody-drug conjugates have become options for certain patients with various stages of disease.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Improved understanding of the molecular biology and genetics of bladder cancer has evolved the way localized and advanced disease is diagnosed and treated. While intravesical BCG has remained the mainstay of therapy for intermediate and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the therapeutic options for muscle-invasive and advanced disease has expanded to include immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition, targeted therapies, and antibody-drug conjugates.",

No Japanese cases have been reported.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed 219 cases previously diagnosed as blue nevus in Japan. Common blue nevus was identified in 154 cases and cellular blue nevus in 65 cases.<h4>Results</h4>We have found two Japanese cases of PEM previously diagnosed as cellular blue nevus. Two patients were female. The age at presentation was 32 and 28 years. Two lesions were on the buttock. Two cases fulfilled histological criteria proposed for PEM. There is no evidence of recurrence or metastases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PEM is a distinct melanocytic tumor and the unifying diagnostic term. PEM is present in Japanese, but these cases may be previously diagnosed as cellular blue nevus. Japanese pathologists should recognize a new concept of PEM, and when they make a diagnosis of PEM, they should be recommended sentinel lymph node sampling.",

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that presynaptic dopamine release from the striatum is abnormal in adults with Tourette's syndrome.<h4>Method</h4>Seven adults with Tourette's syndrome and five age-matched comparison subjects each received two positron emission tomography (PET) scans with high specific activity [11C]raclopride. The first scan followed an intravenous injection of saline; the second followed an intravenous injection of amphetamine. The relative dopamine release was estimated as the percentage difference in binding potential between the postsaline and postamphetamine scans.<h4>Results</h4>Binding potential determined after the initial [11C]raclopride scan did not significantly differ between Tourette's syndrome and comparison subjects. After amphetamine challenge, the mean value of intrasynaptic dopamine in the putamen (as determined by true equilibrium bolus estimation) increased by 21% in the subjects with Tourette's syndrome and did not change in the comparison subjects; the mean values increased by 16.9% and decreased by 1.8%, respectively, when measured by the constrained method. Dopamine release in the caudate region was not significantly different in the Tourette's syndrome and comparison subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Greater putamen dopamine release was seen in adults with Tourette's syndrome than in comparison subjects after a pharmacologic challenge with amphetamine. These results suggest that the underlying pathobiology in Tourette's syndrome is a phasic dysfunction of dopamine transmission.",

We report an updated OS and tolerability analysis, including analyses adjusting for potential bias introduced by crossover from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (for up to 2 years) or investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles). Patients assigned to chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab upon meeting eligibility criteria. The primary end point was progression-free survival; OS was an important key secondary end point. Crossover adjustment analysis was done using the following three methods: simplified two-stage method, rank-preserving structural failure time, and inverse probability of censoring weighting.<h4>Results</h4>Three hundred five patients were randomly assigned (pembrolizumab, n = 154; chemotherapy, n = 151). At data cutoff (July 10, 2017; median follow-up, 25.2 months), 73 patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 96 in the chemotherapy arm had died. Median OS was 30.0 months (95% CI, 18.3 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab and 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.8 to 19.0 months) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.86). Eighty-two patients assigned to chemotherapy crossed over on study to receive pembrolizumab. When adjusted for crossover using the two-stage method, the hazard ratio for OS for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.69); results using rank-preserving structural failure time and inverse probability of censoring weighting were similar. Treatment-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events were less frequent with pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (31.2% v 53.3%, respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>With prolonged follow-up, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy continues to demonstrate an OS benefit over chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated, advanced NSCLC without EGFR/ALK aberrations, despite crossover from the control arm to pembrolizumab as subsequent therapy.",

Extracorporeal clearance of hepatotoxic metabolites, including bilirubin and ammonia, aims to attenuate further hepatocyte damage and liver injury, resulting in decreased mortality. The efficacy of hemadsorption combined with conventional hemodialysis to eliminate bilirubin and ammonia to support the liver's excretory function in acute liver injury has been described previously. However, the optimal use of liver support systems in chronic liver dysfunction due to secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) has not been defined yet. We herein describe the kinetics of successful bilirubin and ammonia elimination by hemadsorption in a patient with SSC-CIP after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the course of the disease, the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before clinically detectable jaundice or elevated bilirubin levels. A diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) based on intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts. The patient showed stable elevations of bilirubin and ammonia levels thereafter, but presented with progressive nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion. Based on these laboratory findings, hemadsorption was combined with hemodialysis treatment and successfully eliminated bilirubin and ammonia. Moreover, direct comparison revealed that ammonia is more efficiently eliminated by hemadsorption than bilirubin levels. Clinical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion improved. In summary, bilirubin and ammonia were successfully eliminated by hemadsorption combined with hemodialysis treatment in SSC-CIP following ECMO therapy and severe COVID-19. This observation is particularly relevant since it has been reported that a considerable subset of critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffer from liver dysfunction associated with high mortality.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8698542?pdf=render

A hepatic tumor in the left lobe was concurrently revealed by computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The appearance suggested liver metastasis. Right hemicolectomy and partial hepatectomy were performed. On histopathological examination, lymphoid follicles with germinal centers were seen in the tumor-like lesion, and remarkable lymphoid infiltration with germinal centers was seen in the portal area around the nodule. Immunohistochemical studies revealed polyclonality of infiltrating lymphocyte. Consequently, this nodular lesion was diagnosed as RLH of the liver. In the second case, a 64-year-old woman who had a radical right hemicolectomy for stage II ascending colon cancer 10 years ago was admitted with dysuria. A hepatic tumor in the left lobe was concurrently revealed by CT and MRI, suggesting hepatocellular carcinoma. A left lateral segmentectomy was performed. Microscopically, this lesion revealed the almost same findings as the first case, so this nodular lesion was diagnosed as RLH of the liver.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our two cases were the first report of RLH of the liver accompanying colon cancer. Because there are a very few cases, so it is not clear whether the malignancies were involved in the onset of RLH. But we believe that new factors involved in the onset mechanism of RLH may be identified by carefully monitoring the clinical course of our two patients.",https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-230X-6-25

A range of neurostimulation approaches, most prominently repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), are rapidly emerging as potential novel interventions. We have previously reviewed these techniques as potential treatments of EDs.<h4>Aim</h4>To provide an update of the literature examining the effects of DBS, rTMS and tDCS on eating behaviours, body weight and associated symptoms in people with EDs and relevant analogue populations.<h4>Methods</h4>Using PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO from 1st January 2013 until 14th August 2017, to update our earlier search. Studies assessing the effects of neurostimulation techniques on eating and weight-related outcomes in people with EDs and relevant analogue populations were included. Data from both searches were combined.<h4>Results</h4>We included a total of 32 studies (526 participants); of these, 18 were newly identified by our update search. Whilst findings are somewhat mixed for bulimia nervosa, neurostimulation techniques have shown potential in the treatment of other EDs, in terms of reduction of ED and associated symptoms. Studies exploring cognitive, neural, and hormonal correlates of these techniques are also beginning to appear.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Neurostimulation approaches show promise as treatments for EDs. As yet, large wellconducted randomised controlled trials are lacking. More information is needed about treatment targets, stimulation parameters and mechanisms of action.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6187753?pdf=render

The purpose of this study is to report the effectiveness of PGT-M based on karyomapping for three cases of dynamic mutation diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion.<h4>Methods</h4>PGT-M was carried out on three couples, whose family members were diagnosed with Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12. The whole genome amplification was obtained using the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) method. Then, karyomapping was performed to detect the allele that is carrying the trinucleotide repeat expansion using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage analyses, and the copy number variations (CNVs) of the embryos were also identified. Prenatal diagnosis was performed to validate the accuracy of PGT-M.<h4>Results</h4>PGT-M was successfully performed on the three couples, and they accepted the transfers of euploid blastocysts without the relevant pathogenic allele. The clinical pregnancies were acquired and the prenatal diagnosis of the three families confirmed the effectiveness of karyomapping. The three born babies were healthy and free of the pathogenic alleles HTT, ATXN2, or PPP2R2B corresponding to Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study shows that karyomapping is a highly powerful and efficient approach for dynamic mutation detection in preimplantation embryos. In this work, we first report the birth of healthy babies that are free of the pathogenic gene for dynamic mutation diseases in patients receiving PGT-M by karyomapping.",

It is not clear whether BRK expression correlates with breast cancer subtypes, or the expression has prognostic or diagnostic significance. Herein, we investigated the correlation of BRK with any breast cancer subtypes and clinicopathological significance of BRK expression in breast cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we examined BRK expression in 120 breast tumor samples and 29 breast cancer cell lines to explore the positive correlation between BRK and the expression of ERα. We used immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and immunoblotting to analyse our experimental samples.<h4>Result</h4>We demonstrate that estrogen induces BRK gene and protein expression in ER+ breast cancer cells. Over-expression of ERα in the ER-negative breast cancer cell line increased BRK expression, and knock-down of ESR1 in MCF7 cells reduced BRK levels. Further, we provide evidence that BRK is regulated by ERα signaling and the presence of ER antagonists (tamoxifen and fulvestrant) reduce the expression of BRK in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the overall survival of ER-positive breast cancer patients is poor when their cancers express high levels of BRK.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data indicate that BRK is a prognostic marker for ER+ breast cancers and provide a strong rationale for targeting BRK to improve patients' survival.",https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12885-018-5186-8

But no studies to date have described hypoxic hepatitis (HH) in patients with COVID-19. We aim to identify the prevalence of and possible mechanisms of HH in COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study was conducted on 51 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ICU at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from December 21, 2019, to March 11, 2020. Information on clinical features of enrolled patients was collected for analysis. <b>Results:</b> HH was observed in 5.88% of the ICU patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All HH patients were progressing to respiratory failure and peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 1665, 1414, and 1140 U/L during hospitalization, respectively. All patients with HH died as a result of the deterioration of multiple organ failure (MOF). The dynamic changes of ALT, aspartate transaminase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) levels were more dramatic in HH groups. Levels of TBIL, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6(IL-6) showed statistically significant elevation in HH cases compared with that in non-HH cases (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Besides, the median survival time of the HH group was significantly shorter than the non-HH group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> In ICU, HH was not a rare condition in patients with severe COVID-19 and has a high mortality. The main causes of HH are respiratory and cardiac failure and may be associated with the immune-mediated inflammatory response. Clinicians should search for any underlying hemodynamic or respiratory instability even in patients with normal ALT levels on admission.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.607206/pdf

Here we review all reported cases of TS DBS and provide updated recommendations for selection, assessment, and management of potential TS DBS cases based on the literature and implantation experience. Candidates should have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM V) diagnosis of TS with severe motor and vocal tics, which despite exhaustive medical and behavioral treatment trials result in significant impairment. Deep brain stimulation should be offered to patients only by experienced DBS centers after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. Rigorous preoperative and postoperative outcome measures of tics and associated comorbidities should be used. Tics and comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions should be optimally treated per current expert standards, and tics should be the major cause of disability. Psychogenic tics, embellishment, and malingering should be recognized and addressed. We have removed the previously suggested 25-year-old age limit, with the specification that a multidisciplinary team approach for screening is employed. A local ethics committee or institutional review board should be consulted for consideration of cases involving persons younger than 18 years of age, as well as in cases with urgent indications.

To determine whether anticoagulant proteins also show such a circadian variation we measured protein C (PC), protein S (PS), antithrombin (AT) and heparin cofactor-II (HC-II) levels on venous plasma samples taken from 10 healthy men at three-hour intervals throughout a 24-hour period. To investigate the possible temporal mapping of circadian periodicity, we also measured plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) as an indicator of platelet activation, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as one of the possible regulatory factors that drive this rhythm. Blood samples were drawn at 6 a.m., 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m. and midnight. PC, IL-6 and beta-TG were measured by ELISA, PS and AT by latex immune assay and HC-II by chromogenic substrate method. A significant circadian variation was found in PC, PS, AT, beta-TG and IL-6, but not in HC-II levels. PC, PS, IL-6 and beta-TG were at their peaks at 6 a.m., and nadirs at a time from noon to midnight. AT peak was at 6 p.m. and nadir at noon. The regression of PS on IL-6 was significant. Although the fluctuations of PS and AT were within the normal ranges during the day, some PC levels of two subjects were below the lower normal limit (0.70). These data indicate that PC, PS, and AT show a marked circadian periodicity as the other components of the blood coagulation and fibrinolytic system do. The similar trends in plasma concentrations of PC, PS, beta-TG and IL-6 may be coincidental, but could reflect a common regulatory mechanism or an effect on each other. The clinical implications of these physiological changes in coagulation inhibitors and the role of IL-6 in the anticoagulant response deserve further studies.",

The 2005 World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (WHO-EORTC) consensus classification has served as a golden standard for the diagnosis and classification of these conditions. In September 2018, an updated version of the WHO-EORTC was published in the fourth edition of the WHO Classification of Skin Tumours Blue Book. In this classification, primary cutaneous acral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus positive (EBV<sup>+</sup>) mucocutaneous ulcer are included as new provisional entities, and a new section on cutaneous forms of chronic active EBV disease has been added. The term ""primary cutaneous CD4<sup>+</sup> small/medium T-cell lymphoma"" was modified to ""primary cutaneous CD4<sup>+</sup> small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder"" because of its indolent clinical behavior and uncertain malignant potential. Modifications have also been made in the sections on lymphomatoid papulosis, increasing the spectrum of histologic and genetic types, and primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas recognizing 2 different subtypes. Herein, the characteristic features of these new and modified entities as well as the results of recent molecular studies with diagnostic, prognostic, and/or therapeutic significance for the different types of primary cutaneous lymphomas are reviewed.

Ticks, fleas, phlebotomine sand flies, and mosquitoes are recognized vectors of pathogens affecting cats and dogs, some of which (e.g., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Dipylidium caninum, Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis, and Dirofilaria repens) are of zoonotic concern. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of fleas as vectors of pathogens of zoonotic relevance (e.g., Rickettsia felis) in this country. While some arthropod vectors (e.g., ticks and fleas) are present in certain Italian regions throughout the year, others (e.g., phlebotomine sand flies) are most active during the summer season. Accordingly, control strategies, such as those relying on the systematic use of acaricides and insecticides, should be planned on the basis of the ecology of both vectors and pathogens in different geographical areas in order to improve their effectiveness in reducing the risk of infection by vector-borne pathogens.

We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 1362 individual studies, of which 36 case-control studies and 4 cohort studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. In high quality case-control studies, there were statistically significant associations between those sustaining head trauma in childhood (OR=1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.44; p<0.001), premorbid head trauma (OR=1.40; 95% CI, 1.08-1.81; p=0.01), and other traumas during childhood (OR=2.31; 95% CI, 1.06-5.04; p=0.04) and the risk of being diagnosed with MS. In lesser quality studies, there was a statistical association between ""other traumas"" premorbid and spinal injury premorbid. No association was found between spinal injury during childhood, or fractures and burns at any age and the diagnosis of MS. The pooled OR of four cohort studies looking at premorbid head trauma was not statistically significant.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The result of the meta-analyses of high quality case-control studies suggests a statistically significant association between premorbid head trauma and the risk for developing MS. However, cohort studies did not. Future prospective studies that define trauma based on validated instruments, and include frequency of traumas per study participant, are needed.",

A highly important technical detail during a PA is the preservation of the frontotemporal branch of the facial nerve, which can be achieved through an interfascial dissection.<h4>Objective</h4>To describe the anatomy of the interfascial vein (IFV), highlighting its recognition as a significant anatomic reference to perform an interfascial dissection (IFD).<h4>Methods</h4>Eight adult cadaveric heads, fixed with formaldehyde and injected with colored silicone, were studied. In 6 heads, an IFD was performed, simulating a PA. In the 2 remaining heads, the IFV was dissected. In addition, an IFD was performed in 10 patients, studying the IFV anatomy.<h4>Results</h4>In the 6 cadaveric heads in which the PA with an IFD was performed, and in the 10 patients who underwent a PA with an IFD, the IFV was found. If the interfascial space is divided into thirds, in all cases, the IFV was located within the middle third of the interfascial fat pad. On the 2 cadaveric heads in which the IFV was anatomically dissected, the IFV was also located within the middle third of the interfascial space.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Recognizing the IFV in the interfascial space is of great help as an anatomic landmark to confirm that one is actually between both layers of the superficial temporal fascia.",

Neurology,"<h4>Background</h4>A severe form of encephalitis associated with antibodies against NR1-NR2 heteromers of the NMDA receptor was recently identified. We aimed to analyse the clinical and immunological features of patients with the disorder and examine the effects of antibodies against NMDA receptors in neuronal cultures.<h4>Methods</h4>We describe the clinical characteristics of 100 patients with encephalitis and NR1-NR2 antibodies. HEK293 cells ectopically expressing single or assembled NR1-NR2 subunits were used to determine the epitope targeted by the antibodies. Antibody titres were measured with ELISA. The effect of antibodies on neuronal cultures was determined by quantitative analysis of NMDA-receptor clusters.<h4>Findings</h4>Median age of patients was 23 years (range 5-76 years); 91 were women. All patients presented with psychiatric symptoms or memory problems; 76 had seizures, 88 unresponsiveness (decreased consciousness), 86 dyskinesias, 69 autonomic instability, and 66 hypoventilation. 58 (59%) of 98 patients for whom results of oncological assessments were available had tumours, most commonly ovarian teratoma. Patients who received early tumour treatment (usually with immunotherapy) had better outcome (p=0.004) and fewer neurological relapses (p=0.009) than the rest of the patients. 75 patients recovered or had mild deficits and 25 had severe deficits or died. Improvement was associated with a decrease of serum antibody titres. The main epitope targeted by the antibodies is in the extracellular N-terminal domain of the NR1 subunit. Patients' antibodies decreased the numbers of cell-surface NMDA receptors and NMDA-receptor clusters in postsynaptic dendrites, an effect that could be reversed by antibody removal.<h4>Interpretation</h4>A well-defined set of clinical characteristics are associated with anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis. The pathogenesis of the disorder seems to be mediated by antibodies.",

To this end, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 entry factor and antigen expression in post-mortem COVID-19 patient ocular surface tissue and observed productive viral replication in cadaver samples and eye organoid cultures, most notably in limbal regions. Transcriptional analysis of ex vivo infected ocular surface cells and hESC-derived eye cultures revealed robust induction of NF-κB in infected cells as well as diminished type I/III interferon signaling.

In 1938, Fischer published a seminal paper describing five segments of the ICA that were designated C1 through C5. These segments were based on the angiographic course of the intracranial ICA rather than its arterial branches or anatomic compartments. Subsequent attempts to apply modern nomenclature to these numerical segments failed to recognize Fischer's original intent of describing patterns of arterial displacement by tumors and, therefore, resulted in a nomenclature that was anatomically inaccurate. Fischer's system was further limited, because segments were numbered opposite the direction of blood flow and the extracranial ICA was excluded. The authors propose a new classification, which includes the entire ICA, uses a numerical scale in the direction of blood flow, and describes the segments of the ICA according to a detailed understanding of the anatomy surrounding the ICA and the compartments through which it travels. Twenty cadaveric specimens with intravascular injection of silicone rubber were used for microscopic dissection and 20 dry skulls were inspected. Histological sections in critical areas were examined. The authors' classification has the following seven segments: C1, cervical; C2, petrous; C3, lacerum; C4 cavernous; C5, clinoid; C6, ophthalmic; and C7, communicating. This classification is practical, accounts for new anatomic information and clinical interests, and clarifies all segments of the ICA.",

WT1 binds preferentially to DNA sequences that are closely related to the EGR-1 consensus site. We report the structure determination by both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy of the WT1 zinc finger domain in complex with DNA. The X-ray structure was determined for the complex with a cognate 14 base-pair oligonucleotide, and composite X-ray/NMR structures were determined for complexes with both the 14 base-pair and an extended 17 base-pair DNA. This combined approach allowed unambiguous determination of the position of the first zinc finger, which is influenced by lattice contacts in the crystal structure. The crystal structure shows the second, third and fourth zinc finger domains inserted deep into the major groove of the DNA where they make base-specific interactions. The DNA duplex is distorted in the vicinity of the first zinc finger, with a cytidine twisted and tilted out of the base stack to pack against finger 1 and the tip of finger 2. By contrast, the composite X-ray/NMR structures show that finger 1 continues to follow the major groove in the solution complexes. However, the orientation of the helix is non-canonical, and the fingertip and the N terminus of the helix project out of the major groove; as a consequence, the zinc finger side-chains that are commonly involved in base recognition make no contact with the DNA. We conclude that finger 1 helps to anchor WT1 to the DNA by amplifying the binding affinity although it does not contribute significantly to binding specificity. The structures provide molecular level insights into the potential consequences of mutations in zinc fingers 2 and 3 that are associated with Denys-Drash syndrome and nephritic syndrome. The mutations are of two types, and either destabilize the zinc finger structure or replace key base contact residues.",

Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is the term used to categorize a pregnancy in a woman with a positive pregnancy test when no pregnancy has been visualized using TVS. This review appraises current tools for the diagnosis of EP, describes the diagnostic criteria for non-tubal EP and reviews the literature on the clinical management of PUL.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a targeted search using the PubMed database. All articles published in the English language from January 1984 to March 2013 were screened for eligibility.<h4>Results</h4>Using TVS to diagnose EP is highly sensitive (87-99%) and specific (94-99.9%). Variations exist in the criteria used for ultrasound diagnosis. Studies report that between 5 and 42% of women seen for ultrasound assessment with a positive pregnancy test have a PUL. For PUL, measurements of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and progesterone are used to predict pregnancy viability and therefore give an indication of the risk of an EP. Only 6-20% of PUL are subsequently diagnosed with EP. Non-tubal EPs are relatively uncommon, difficult to diagnose and result in disproportionate morbidity and mortality.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Access to expertise and equipment for high-quality TVS means the majority of women with EP in developed countries can be diagnosed rapidly and accurately. Identifying PUL, which are low risk and therefore requiring less follow-up, finding better serum markers for EP and safely identifying women who do not require intervention for EP are the current diagnostic challenges.",

As this rare anatomical variant artery may be involved in endovascular procedures or encountered surgically during basilar terminus aneurysms, the present study was warranted.<h4>Method</h4>Thirty-four adult (20 male and 14 female) formalin-fixed cadaveric brains underwent dissection of the 68 posterior cerebral arteries. Observations were made of the presence and the variations of the thalamoperforating arteries as well as the presence of the AOP.<h4>Findings</h4>Thalamoperforating arteries arose from the superior or posterior surfaces of the P1 segment at a mean of a 1.87 mm (range, 0.39-5.25 mm) distance from the basilar apex and entered the brain through the posterior perforated substance. The average number was 4.25 (range 1-9), and the mean diameter was 0.73 mm (range 0.46-1.16 mm). Thalamoperforating arteries were classified into four different types according to their origin at the P1 segment: type I (bilateral multiple, n = 19), 55.8 %; type II (unilateral multiple, unilateral single, n = 4), 11.7 %; type III (bilateral single, n = 7), 20.5 %; type IV [one side with a single branch, the other side with no branches (the AOP), n = 4], 11.7 %. In three separate specimens with ruptured basilar artery aneurysms, the origin of the thalamoperforating arteries was incorporated not only into the posterior aspect of the aneurysm neck but also into the fundus.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In about one tenth of cases the possibility of the presence of a single arterial trunk that supplies the two paramedian thalamic territories should be taken into consideration during treatment planning of basilar terminus aneurysms. Furthermore, our data show that the thalamoperforating arteries may take off from both the aneurysm neck and the fundus.",

Thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria of having an isolated BOFs with or without a minimally displaced medial wall fracture. The maxillofacial CT of these patients, which included axial, coronal, and sagittal reconstruction of the face in both soft tissue and bone algorithm, were independently reviewed by a neuroradiologist and an oculoplastic surgeon. Each reviewer analyzed the images to answer the following 3 questions: (1) extent of the fracture fragment; greater than or less than 50%? (2) involvement of the inframedial strut (IMS)? and (3) cranial-caudal discrepancy of the orbits. This novel measurement was defined as the difference between the cranial-caudal dimension (CCD), measured just posterior to the globe, of the fractured orbit minus the CCD of the normal side. Electronic medical record was reviewed to determine the course of recovery, ophthalmologist assessment of the globe, motility, diplopia, and the need for operative repair. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the accuracy of the measured CT parameters for the prediction of those who would ultimately require surgical repair.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 33 patients included in the study, 8 patients required surgical correction of their BOFs. Others were managed conservatively. The accuracy of BOF > 50% for predicting those requiring surgical repair was 48%. The accuracy of IMS involvement was 74%. Using a threshold CCD value of 0.8 cm, the accuracy of CCD was 94%. Cranial-caudal discrepancy had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92%. κ Agreement between the 2 readers evaluating the CT images was 0.93.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Initial maxillofacial CT studies obtained in the ED for those with BOF is used to predict which patients may need urgent surgical repair. In this report, we introduce a new CT measurement, called CCD. Cranial-caudal discrepancy greater than 0.8 cm is predictive of the development of diplopia and/or enophthalmos that will require surgical correction. Orbital floor fracture greater than 50% and IMS involvement were much less accurate in making similar predictions. Cranial-caudal discrepancy should be used by the ED physicians to identify those patients who should be referred sooner than later to an oculoplastic surgeon for surgical evaluation and intervention. Correct and timely triaging can prevent the complications of delayed correction including scarring, difficult surgical repair, and/or poor functional and aesthetic outcomes.",

Their demographics etiology, associated systemic diseases, bacteriology, radiology, treatment, duration of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes were reviewed. The attributing factors to deep neck infections, such as the age and systemic diseases of patients, were also analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred eighty-five charts were recorded; 109 (58.9%) were men, and 76 (41.1%) were women, with a mean age of 49.5 +/- 20.5 years. Ninety-seven (52.4%) of the patients were older than 50 years old. There were 63 patients (34.1%) who had associated systemic diseases, with 88.9% (56/63) of those having diabetes mellitus (DM). The parapharyngeal space (38.4%) was the most commonly involved space. Odontogenic infections and upper airway infections were the two most common causes of deep neck infections (53.2% and 30.5% of the known causes). Streptococcus viridans and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common organisms (33.9%, 33.9%) identified through pus cultures. K. pneumoniae was also the most common infective organism (56.1%) in patients with DM. Of the abscess group (142 patients), 103 patients (72.5%) underwent surgical drainages. Thirty patients (16.2%) had major complications during admission, and among them, 18 patients received tracheostomies. Those patients with underlying systemic diseases or complications or who received tracheostomy tended to have a longer hospital stay and were older. There were three deaths (mortality rate, 1.6%). All had an underlying systemic disease and were older than 72 years of age.<h4>Conclusions</h4>When dealing with deep neck infections in a high-risk group (older patients with DM or other underlying systemic diseases) in the clinic, more attention should be paid to the prevention of complications and even the possibility of death. Early surgical drainage remains the main method of treating deep neck abscesses. Therapeutic needle aspiration and conservative medical treatment are effective in selective cases such as those with minimal abscess formation.",

The median Breslow depth was 2.22 mm. A SLNB was performed in 17 patients, eight (47%) were positive. Younger age was associated with: (i) animal-type melanoma with features equivocal for malignancy (median age of 7 vs. 48 years, P = 0.01), and (ii) a negative SLNB (median age 12 vs. 53 years, P = 0.03). Four patients with unequivocal animal-type melanoma developed recurrent metastatic disease, with one patient death. No patient with an equivocal animal-type melanoma or negative SLNB developed recurrent disease; however, this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.13 and P = 0.09, respectively). Conclusions Animal-type melanoma has a propensity for regional lymphatic metastasis and is rarely capable of disseminated metastatic disease and death. Animal-type melanoma appears to exhibit a spectrum of biological behaviour, with young patient age associated with more indolent disease.",

First-line treatment remains conservative, but several surgical techniques have also been described. We describe a 44-year-old woman with increasing pain in her left heel for a year and a half, who noticed swelling on the lateral side of the calcaneus. The patient underwent radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography of her left foot, which was suspicious for an intraosseous lipoma with a threatening calcaneal fracture. We performed a surgical procedure, curettage of the tumor, spongioplastics (by autologous bone transplant and β-tricalcium phosphate), and internal stabilization with a calcaneal plate considering the goal of immediate postoperative weightbearing. Histologic examination confirmed an intraosseous lipoma of the calcaneus. The patient's pain was relieved immediately after surgery. Internal stabilization of the calcaneus allowed the patient to immediately fully weightbear and to return to usual daily activities. Although a benign bone tumor, intraosseous lipoma can cause many complications, such as persistent pain, decreased function, or even pathologic fracture as a result of calcaneal bone weakening. Choosing an appropriate treatment is still controversial. Conservative treatment is the first option, but for patients with severe problems and threatening fracture, surgery is necessary.

Disease manifestations could be severe in infancy but improve after the age of 1-3 years. Some affected members are asymptomatic and remain so life-long. In this study, we report the identification of a large deletion in the NR3C2 gene (c.1897+1_1898-1)_(c.*2955+?)del in renal PHA1 patients from an extended family spanning four generations. We prospectively evaluated the plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone profiles over four decades in symptomatic and asymptomatic affected family members. The benefits of early diagnosis on the clinical outcome were assessed as well. The long-term follow-up showed an age-dependent decrease in both plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels over the years. However, aldosterone levels remain high life-long. Thus, levels of aldosterone are a reliable marker to detect asymptomatic family members. The diagnosis of the proposita led to early diagnosis and therapy in other affected family members, significantly mitigating the clinical course. Despite the extremely elevated serum aldosterone levels during pregnancy, affected pregnant women did not experience any ill effects.

Microbe,"<h4>Background</h4>Studies have found different waning rates of neutralising antibodies compared with binding antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The impact of neutralising antibody waning rate at the individual patient level on the longevity of immunity remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the peak levels and dynamics of neutralising antibody waning and IgG avidity maturation over time, and correlate this with clinical parameters, cytokines, and T-cell responses.<h4>Methods</h4>We did a longitudinal study of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 up to day 180 post-symptom onset by monitoring changes in neutralising antibody levels using a previously validated surrogate virus neutralisation test. Changes in antibody avidities and other immune markers at different convalescent stages were determined and correlated with clinical features. Using a machine learning algorithm, temporal change in neutralising antibody levels was classified into five groups and used to predict the longevity of neutralising antibody-mediated immunity.<h4>Findings</h4>We approached 517 patients for participation in the study, of whom 288 consented for outpatient follow-up and collection of serial blood samples. 164 patients were followed up and had adequate blood samples collected for analysis, with a total of 546 serum samples collected, including 128 blood samples taken up to 180 days post-symptom onset. We identified five distinctive patterns of neutralising antibody dynamics as follows: negative, individuals who did not, at our intervals of sampling, develop neutralising antibodies at the 30% inhibition level (19 [12%] of 164 patients); rapid waning, individuals who had varying levels of neutralising antibodies from around 20 days after symptom onset, but seroreverted in less than 180 days (44 [27%] of 164 patients); slow waning, individuals who remained neutralising antibody-positive at 180 days post-symptom onset (46 [28%] of 164 patients); persistent, although with varying peak neutralising antibody levels, these individuals had minimal neutralising antibody decay (52 [32%] of 164 patients); and delayed response, a small group that showed an unexpected increase of neutralising antibodies during late convalescence (at 90 or 180 days after symptom onset; three [2%] of 164 patients). Persistence of neutralising antibodies was associated with disease severity and sustained level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, T-cell responses were similar among the different neutralising antibody dynamics groups. On the basis of the different decay dynamics, we established a prediction algorithm that revealed a wide range of neutralising antibody longevity, varying from around 40 days to many decades.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Neutralising antibody response dynamics in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 vary greatly, and prediction of immune longevity can only be accurately determined at the individual level. Our findings emphasise the importance of public health and social measures in the ongoing pandemic outbreak response, and might have implications for longevity of immunity after vaccination.<h4>Funding</h4>National Medical Research Council, Biomedical Research Council, and A*STAR, Singapore.",http://www.thelancet.com/article/S2666524721000252/pdf

The present study was undertaken to review the spectrum of fetal central veins and umbilico-portal system anomalies, and to propose a classification system.<h4>Methods</h4>A 7-year restrospective survey was conducted.<h4>Results</h4>Nineteen fetuses showed abnormal connection between central veins and the fetal heart. Three fetuses showed abnormal connections of the cardinal veins, two of which had interruption of the inferior vena cava, and one had isolated persistent left superior vena cava. Anomalies of pulmonary veins were seen in four fetuses: in two with asplenia syndrome, a vertical confluent pulmonary artery was observed. In a further two cases total anomalous pulmonary venous connections were found. Abnormalities of the umbilical vein (UV) were seen in 10 cases; seven had persistent right UV, and three had a spectrum of anomalies: One had abnormal connections of the UV to the left iliac vein associated with agenesis of the ductus venosus (DV) and hydrops fetalis. One case showed in utero occlusion of the DV by echogenic foci that resulted in a persistent left proximal UV and porto-systemic shunt. One case had obliteration of the DV secondary to in utero fetal hepatic fibrosis. Abnormalities of the vitelline veins or portal system were demonstrated in two cases. One had a left porto-systemic shunt which resolved spontaneously at 3 months of age, and one had secondary partial occlusion of the left portal system with liver echogenicities and direct communication of the UV with the right atrium. None of the 19 cases had an abnormal karyotype or evidence of in utero infection.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Detection of various fetal vein anomalies in utero is feasible. The anomalies vary according to embryologic precursors or etiology. Two major mechanisms seem to be involved in the genesis of fetal vein anomalies: in most cases primary maldevelopment of the venous system occurs, while in the minority secondary anomalies from possible thromboembolic events or systemic disease may play a role.",

All patients (mortality at 28 days: 42%, mean admission SAPS II score: 54) had decreased HLA-DR expression. This expression was significantly lower in non-survivors at all time points. All patients had elevated IL-10 concentrations, the highest values were found in non-survivors. IL-10 was the sole cytokine to significantly correlate with HLA-DR expression (r: -0.6, p<0.001). TNF and TGF values did not provide any prognostic information. TGF levels from septic patients were even found to be decreased in comparison with normal values which suggested that IL-10 is likely more important than TGF regarding the immunosuppressive properties of septic patients' plasma.

American journal of neuroradiology,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Occlusion of the AOP results in a characteristic pattern of ischemia: bilateral paramedian thalamus with or without midbrain involvement. Although the classic imaging findings are often recognized, only a few small case series and isolated cases of AOP infarction have been reported. The purpose of this study was to characterize the complete imaging spectrum of AOP infarction on the basis of a large series of cases obtained from multiple institutions.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Imaging and clinical data of 37 patients with AOP infarction from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The primary imaging criterion for inclusion was an abnormal signal intensity on MR imaging and/or hypoattenuation on CT involving distinct arterial zones of the bilateral paramedian thalami with or without rostral midbrain involvement. Patients were excluded if there was a neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory etiology.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 4 ischemic patterns of AOP infarction: 1) bilateral paramedian thalamic with midbrain (43%), 2) bilateral paramedian thalamic without midbrain (38%), 3) bilateral paramedian thalamic with anterior thalamus and midbrain (14%), and 4) bilateral paramedian thalamic with anterior thalamus without midbrain (5%). A previously unreported finding (the ""V"" sign) on FLAIR and DWI sequences was identified in 67% of cases of AOP infarction with midbrain involvement and supports the diagnosis when present.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The 4 distinct patterns of ischemia identified in our large case series, along with the midbrain V sign, should improve recognition of AOP infarction and assist with the neurologic evaluation and management of patients with thalamic strokes.",

For each drug, an efficacy index (El) was determined as follows: ""0"" for less than 30% improvement, as judged by the patient, on horizontal visual analog scale, ""0.5"" for partial efficacy, and ""1"" for more than 60% improvement.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 120 patients with the SAPHO syndrome (50 men, 70 women), of whom 102 patients were followed-up prospectively after 1992; 3 of these 102 patients were lost to follow-up. Six patients also had Crohn's disease, and three had ulcerative colitis. Except for a significant association of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) or psoriasis vulgaris (PV) with axial osteitis (P = .007), the dermatologic presentation had no significant influence on rheumatic symptoms (ie, osteitis or arthritis, peripheral or axial). The HLA B27 antigen was not significantly associated with a particular pattern of distribution of arthritis or osteitis. No severe or disabling complications were noted. In the 47 patients followed-up for more than 5 years (mean, 9.5; range, 5 to 23), the mean number of osteitis or arthritis foci increased during follow-up from 1.57 to 1.91 and from 2.68 to 3.11, respectively. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed in 113 of 120 (94%) patients, with a mean El of 0.67 (+/-0.39). Corticosteroid (CS) therapy was used in 23 patients, with a mean El of 0.67 (+/-0.42). Colchicine and sulfasalazine had a mean El of 0.36 (+/-0.44) and 0.16 (+/-0.30), in 28 and 18 patients, respectively. Methotrexate was given to 10 patients (6 with peripheral arthritis), with a mean El of 0.64 (+/-0.48). Doxycyclin (100 mg twice daily) was used in 20 patients, usually to treat osteitis, with a mean El of 0.26 (+/-0.42). Intraarticular injections of a CS or osmic acid were used in 27 patients, with a mean El of 0.77 (+/-0.35).<h4>Conclusions</h4>SAPHO syndrome is a relevant and stable entity, with a good long-term prognosis. NSAIDs and intraarticular injections (CS or osmic acid) most often alleviate rheumatic symptoms, but prednisone or methotrexate are sometimes necessary and appear globally helpful.",

It not only investigates the decision-making of patients, especially the medical consultation, but also further influences on the therapy decision and the patients' evaluation of possible side-effects of the treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Only a minority of the patients was informed about radiosurgery and radiotherapy at all.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The praxis of patient counselling of acoustic neuroma patients in Germany is far from the ideal condition of medical consultation: The most important shortcoming is that it is unilateral: About 69% of the patients are informed about only one treatment option, generally surgery. Furthermore, information about side effects is usually insufficient. We recommend to advice all patients on all treatment options by an interdisciplinary team. The counselling should firstly be based on evidence-based medicine and secondly respond to the patients' individual life situation and preferences.",

We aimed to improve the understanding of PCS by analyzing variables that influence the mortality of PCS patients.<h4>Methods</h4>The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for cases of PCS from 1973 to 2016. Cases were analyzed for patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and surgical intervention. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to investigate the overall survival (OS) and prognostic factors.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-nine cases of PCS were identified along with the disease demographics and characteristics. The majority of patients had a regionally invasive or metastatic disease. There was a significant decrease in OS with the increase of the tumor extension. Conversely, surgery showed to improve OS in the crude analysis, including patients that underwent lymphadenectomy. In addition, the unadjusted Cox regression results showed decreased hazard ratios with a local disease versus distant metastasis and with cancer-directed surgery versus no surgery. Nevertheless, the adjusted Cox regression results revealed that metastatic disease was the only significant predictor of survival.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This population-based study provides some insight to a very rare disease by analyzing 39 cases of PCS. Our finding suggests considering PCS as a nonsurgical disease and reserving surgery solely for patients with a localized disease in combination or after neoadjuvant therapy. Consequently, there is a need to further investigate novel therapies for this aggressive malignancy.",

In the present study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays were used to analyse the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, and some pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including MCP-1, TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of SARS. SARS-CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2-expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS-CoV infection in vivo in humans. High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS-CoV-infected ACE2+ cells, but not in the uninfected cells. These results suggest that cells infected by SARS-CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno-mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi-organ dysfunction. Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS.",

The presence of miliary nodules in the CNS was recorded. Lesions were categorized according to their distribution, enhancement pattern, size and signal characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>A miliary distribution of nodules was present in 88% of patients. All patients with a miliary distribution had leptomeningeal nodules and 18% of these patients had deep parenchymal nodules in addition. At least one tuberculoma with central T2 hypointensity was identified in 39% of patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The high prevalence of miliary leptomeningeal nodules in the CNS of children with TBM is significant because it points to a pathogenetic relationship that has long been suspected on epidemiological grounds.

High-volume plasma exchange (HVP), defined as exchange of 8-12 or 15% of ideal body weight with fresh frozen plasma in case series improves systemic, cerebral and splanchnic parameters.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective, randomised, controlled, multicentre trial we randomly assigned 182 patients with ALF to receive either standard medical therapy (SMT; 90 patients) or SMT plus HVP for three days (92 patients). The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. The primary endpoint was liver transplantation-free survival during hospital stay. Secondary-endpoints included survival after liver transplantation with or without HVP with intention-to-treat analysis. A proof-of-principle study evaluating the effect of HVP on the immune cell function was also undertaken.<h4>Results</h4>For the entire patient population, overall hospital survival was 58.7% for patients treated with HVP vs. 47.8% for the control group (hazard ratio (HR), with stratification for liver transplantation: 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.86; p=0.0083). HVP prior to transplantation did not improve survival compared with patients who received SMT alone (CI 0.37 to 3.98; p=0.75). The incidence of severe adverse events was similar in the two groups. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores fell in the treated group compared to control group, over the study period (p<0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment with HVP improves outcome in patients with ALF by increasing liver transplant-free survival.

While dysfunction in serotoninergic neurotransmission is believed to play an important role, several neurologic and immuno-endocrine mechanisms may also be relevant. A theory is advanced based on an inherited imbalance in neuro-vegetative systems resulting from increased sympathetic tone because of a metabolic deficiency in the serotoninergic system that, when exposed to a precipitating event, leads to the development of the clinical manifestations of FM. The importance of both nonpharmacological treatments and multimodal medication management is stressed.",

Because most screening tools are complex and biased toward fluid swallowing, we developed a simple, stepwise bedside screen that allows a graded rating with separate evaluations for nonfluid and fluid nutrition starting with nonfluid textures. The Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) aims at reducing the risk of aspiration during the test to a minimum; it assesses the severity of aspiration risk and recommends a special diet accordingly.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifty acute-stroke patients were assessed prospectively. The validity of the GUSS was established by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. For interrater reliability, 2 independent therapists evaluated 20 patients within a 2-hour period. For external validity, another group of 30 patients was tested by stroke nurses. For content validity, the liquid score of the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing was compared with the semisolid score.<h4>Results</h4>Interrater reliability yielded excellent agreement between both raters (kappa=0.835, P<0.001). In both groups, GUSS predicted aspiration risk well (area under the curve=0.77; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.02 in the 20-patient sample; area under the curve=0.933; 95% CI, 0.833 to 1.033 in the 30-patient sample). The cutoff value of 14 points resulted in 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 100% in the 20-patient sample and of 100%, 69%, and 100%, respectively, in the 30-patient sample. Content validity showed a significantly higher aspiration risk with liquids compared with semisolid textures (P=0.001), therefore confirming the subtest sequence of GUSS.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The GUSS offers a quick and reliable method to identify stroke patients with dysphagia and aspiration risk. Such a graded assessment considers the pathophysiology of voluntary swallowing in a more differentiated fashion and provides less discomfort for those patients who can continue with their oral feeding routine for semisolid food while refraining from drinking fluids.",

At the end of each exposure period, we examined pulmonary and cardiovascular biomarkers of injury. In the 16-week study, we observed mild pulmonary pathology in the ozone, DEP, and ozone + DEP exposure groups, a slight decrease in circulating lymphocytes in the ozone and DEP groups, and decreased platelets in the DEP group. After 16 weeks of exposure, mRNA biomarkers of oxidative stress (hemeoxygenase-1), thrombosis (tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue plasminogen activator, and von Willebrand factor), vasoconstriction (endothelin-1, endothelin receptors A and B, endothelial NO synthase) and proteolysis [matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-3, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease-2] were increased by DEP and/or ozone in the aorta, but not in the heart. Aortic LOX-1 (lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1) mRNA and protein increased after ozone exposure, and LOX-1 protein increased after exposure to ozone + DEP. RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) mRNA increased in the ozone + DEP group. Exposure to ozone or DEP depleted cardiac mitochondrial phospholipid fatty acids (DEP > ozone). The combined effect of ozone and DEP exposure was less pronounced than exposure to either pollutant alone. Exposure to ozone or DEP for 2 days (acute) caused mild changes in the aorta.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In animals exposed to ozone or DEP alone for 16 weeks, we observed elevated biomarkers of vascular impairments in the aorta, with the loss of phospholipid fatty acids in myocardial mitochondria.

We evaluated a nonfluoroscopic three-dimensional mapping system, termed CARTO, and compared the results of ablation using this technique with those of conventional mapping.<h4>Methods and results</h4>We compared the results of 88 arrhythmia ablations (79 patients) using CARTO with 100 ablations (94 patients) using the conventional technique. The ablations were separated into four groups: (1) AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT); (2) atrial tachycardia/flutter; (3) ventricular tachycardia (VT); and (4) bypass tract tachycardia. We compared the success rate, complications, and fluoroscopy and procedure times. The ablation outcomes were excellent and comparable in all four types of the arrhythmias between the two techniques. Major complications included one cardiac tamponade in each group and one second-degree AV block in the conventional group. Fluoroscopy time was shorter using the CARTO technique: 10+/-7 versus 27+/-15 minutes for AVNRT (P < 0.01), 18+/-17 versus 44+/-23 minutes for atrial tachycardia and flutter (P < 0.01), 15+/-12 versus 34+/-31 minutes for VT (P < 0.05), and 21+/-14 versus 53+/-32 minutes for bypass tract tachycardia (P < 0.01). Procedure times were similar except for the bypass tract patients, which was shorter in the CARTO group, 4+/-1.3 versus 5.5+/-2.5 hours (P < 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The electroanatomic three-dimensional mapping technique reduced fluoroscopy time and resulted in excellent outcome without increasing the procedure time.",

Here, we summarize neurologic irAEs associated with nivolumab and ipilimumab melanoma treatment, present cases of treatment-related encephalitis, and provide practical guidance on diagnosis and management.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched a Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology database for neurologic irAEs reported over an 8-year period in patients with advanced melanoma receiving nivolumab with or without ipilimumab from 12 studies sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Serious neurologic irAEs were reviewed, and relationship to nivolumab or ipilimumab was assigned.<h4>Results</h4>In our search of 3,763 patients, 35 patients (0.93%) presented with 43 serious neurologic irAEs, including neuropathy (<i>n</i> = 22), noninfective meningitis (<i>n</i> = 5), encephalitis (<i>n</i> = 6), neuromuscular disorders (<i>n</i> = 3), and nonspecific adverse events (<i>n</i> = 7). Study drug was discontinued (<i>n</i> = 20), interrupted (<i>n</i> = 8), or unchanged (<i>n</i> = 7). Most neurologic irAEs resolved (26/35 patients; 75%). Overall, median time to onset was 45 days (range 1-170) and to resolution was 32 days (2-809+). Median time to onset of encephalitis was 55.5 days (range 18-297); four cases resolved and one was fatal.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both oncologists and neurologists need to be aware of signs and symptoms of serious but uncommon neurologic irAEs associated with checkpoint inhibitors. Prompt diagnosis and management using an established algorithm are critical to minimize serious complications from these neurologic irAEs.<h4>Implications for practice</h4>With increasing use of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer, practicing oncologists need to be aware of the potential risk of neurologic immune-related adverse events and be able to provide prompt treatment of this uncommon, but potentially serious, class of adverse events. We summarize neurologic adverse events related to nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma from 12 studies and examine in depth 6 cases of encephalitis. We also provide input and guidance on the existing neurologic adverse events management algorithm for nivolumab and ipilimumab.",

These patients had hip pain, negative radiographs, and radionuclide bone scans consistent with femoral neck stress fracture. Twenty-two hips were identified as positive for femoral neck stress fracture by bone scan. Each patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging and 6-week follow-up plain radiographs of the hips. Magnetic resonance imaging studies differentiated femoral neck stress fractures from a synovial pit, iliopsoas muscle tear, iliopsoas tendinitis, obturator externus tendinitis, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and a unicameral bone cyst. The follow-up radiographs were used to verify the diagnosis of stress fracture. The radiographs showed healing callus in patients with stress fractures. Patients with diagnoses other than stress fractures had no changes on follow-up radiographs. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were as sensitive and much more specific than bone scan in determining the cause of hip pain. Radionuclide bone scan had an accuracy of 68% for femoral neck stress fractures with 32% false-positive results; MRI was 100% accurate. Magnetic resonance imaging proved to be superior to radionuclide bone scanning in providing an early and accurate diagnostic tool that aided in the differential diagnosis of hip pain in the young endurance athlete.",

Three decades of increasingly powerful scientific studies have shown that SRS improves outcomes and reduces toxicity when it replaces whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Expert opinion surveys of clinicians have reported that the total intracranial tumor volume rather than the number of brain metastases is related to outcomes. As a result, an increasing number of treating and referring physicians have replaced the reflex use of WBRT with SRS, unless the patient has miliary disease or carcinomatous meningitis. In the current era of immunotherapy and targeted therapies with potentially increased systemic disease survival, 10 or more tumors are routinely treated with SRS alone at most academic medical centers. In a single SRS session we routinely treat patients with cumulative tumor volumes of 25 cm3 even if they have ≥10 metastases.",

Neuroimaging,"The reduction in the oxygenation dynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during cognitive tasks is a well-known occurrence in major depressive disorders (MDD). Studies focusing on oxygenation changes in the PFC in individuals with suicidal ideation are limited. Therefore, this study investigated and confirmed the presence of prefrontal dysfunction depending on the intensity of suicidal ideation among 77 young adults (45 patients with MDD and 32 healthy controls) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). All participants underwent assessment with the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation. NIRS revealed relative hypofunction in the left dorsolateral PFC, left ventrolateral PFC (LVLPFC), and both orbitofrontal cortices in young adults with MDD compared to that in the healthy controls during verbal fluency tasks. Furthermore, the oxyhaemoglobin changes in the LVLPFC mediated the indirect effect of depression severity on suicidal ideation intensity. Our results confirmed that functional NIRS is a useful auxiliary tool for objectively assessing the risk of suicidal ideation.",

Most commonly, carcinosarcomas arise in the uterus as malignant mixed müllerian tumors, but also infrequently appear in other organs such as the ovaries and breast, the prostate and urinary tract, the lungs, or in the gastrointestinal system, among others. Pancreatic carcinosarcomas are exceedingly rare; only a few cases are reported in the English literature. Their pathogenesis remains to be fully clarified. We present here the case of a pancreatic carcinosarcoma with evidence for monoclonality via determination of Kras mutational status after microdissection and suggest a common origin of the 2 tumor components. Comprehensive review of the available literature allows the conclusion that most pancreatic carcinosarcomas appear to be of monoclonal origin and seem to have arisen from a carcinoma via metaplastic transformation of 1 part or subclone of the tumor, probably by epithelial-mesenchymal transition. All reported patients were treated with surgery. Adjuvant therapy, if administered, consisted predominantly of gemcitabine. Prognosis for this neoplasm occurs to be similar or even worse compared with classic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Techniques included immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, cell-base experiments with Kv4.2 and several dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX) plasmid constructs, and comparative brain immunostaining of wild-type and DPPX-null mice.<h4>Results</h4>Immunoprecipitation studies identified DPPX as the target autoantigen. A cell-based assay confirmed that all 4 patients, but not 210 controls, had DPPX antibodies. Symptoms included agitation, confusion, myoclonus, tremor, and seizures (1 case with prominent startle response). All patients had pleocytosis, and 3 had severe prodromal diarrhea of unknown etiology. Given that DPPX tunes up the Kv4.2 potassium channels (involved in somatodendritic signal integration and attenuation of dendritic back-propagation of action potentials), we determined the epitope distribution in DPPX, DPP10 (a protein homologous to DPPX), and Kv4.2. Patients' antibodies were found to be specific for DPPX, without reacting with DPP10 or Kv4.2. The unexplained diarrhea led to a demonstration of a robust expression of DPPX in the myenteric plexus, which strongly reacted with patients' antibodies. The course of neuropsychiatric symptoms was prolonged and often associated with relapses during decreasing immunotherapy. Long-term follow-up showed substantial improvement in 3 patients (1 was lost to follow-up).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Antibodies to DPPX are associated with a protracted encephalitis characterized by central nervous system hyperexcitability (agitation, myoclonus, tremor, seizures), pleocytosis, and frequent diarrhea at symptom onset. The disorder is potentially treatable with immunotherapy.",

We found that coinfection is generally reported to worsen human health (76% publications) and exacerbate infections (57% publications). Reported coinfections included all kinds of pathogens, but were most likely to contain bacteria.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest differences between coinfected patients and those with single infections, with coinfection having serious health effects.

The current study combined rTMS and EEG paradigms to examine the causal role of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in modulating visceral and behavioral responses to high calorie foods, and the mediational mechanisms underlying this relation. 28 right-handed female participants received both active and sham continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS; a rTMS variant used to decrease cortical activity) targeting the left dlPFC in a counterbalanced order. Prior to and following each stimulation session participants completed a flanker and food-cue presentation (high and low calorie food) task. Following cTBS participants had the opportunity to consume both high and low calorie foods during a taste test. Findings revealed a reliable effect of cTBS on food consumption, such that participants selectively ingested significantly more calories from appetitive calorie dense snack foods following active relative to sham cTBS; this effect did not translate to control (low calorie) food consumption. In addition, attenuation of dlPFC activity resulted in the significant increase in N2 amplitude and P3b latency to incongruent flanker trials, and the selective significant increase in the P3a amplitude to and P3a amplitude bias for high calorie food stimuli. Results from the parallel mediation analysis revealed that only the indirect effect of flanker task performance was significant; the indirect effects of stimulation induced changes in the P3 bias for high calorie foods, the urge to consume high calorie foods, and the general liking ratings for high calorie foods were not significant. These findings confirm the causal role of the left dlPFC in the modulation of calorie dense food consumption via inhibitory control capacity.",

In this context, revisiting the definition of myocarditis is appropriate with a specific focus on diagnostic and management considerations in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Pathologic cardiac specimens from patients with COVID-19 suggest a mixed inflammatory response involving lymphocytes and macrophages, and importantly, cellular injury occurs predominantly at the level of pericytes and endothelial cells, less often involving direct myocyte necrosis. In COVID-19, the diagnosis of myocarditis has understandably been based predominantly on clinical criteria, and the number of patients with clinically suspected myocarditis who would meet diagnostic histological criteria is unclear. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance are important diagnostic tools, although the prognostic implications of abnormalities are still being defined. Importantly, SARS-CoV2 myocarditis should be diagnosed within an appropriate clinical context and should not be based on isolated imaging findings. Therapies in COVID-19 have focused on the major clinical manifestation of pneumonia, but the promotion of viral clearance early in the disease could prevent the development of myocarditis, and further study of immunosuppressive therapies once myocarditis has developed are indicated. A strict and uniform approach is needed to diagnose myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the natural history of this disease and to facilitate evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions. A methodological approach will also better inform the incidence of COVID-19 associated myocarditis and potential long-term health effects.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11886-021-01551-x.pdf

The more severe the symptoms, the more comprehensive and complex are the methods needed to treat patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the role of rehabilitation as one of the pillars in COVID-19 management, considering its advantages. It has been implemented in some countries' guidelines, but it is not stated in Indonesia's guideline. Thus, rehabilitation intervention is sometimes neglected or delayed. This case report aims to describe the possible benefit of optimizing the rehabilitation program during hospitalization. CASE REPORT We describe 2 patients with severe COVID-19: Patient A was a 53-year-old man without comorbidities and Patient B was a 68-year-old man with several comorbidities. Patient A was discharged from the hospital with respiratory sequelae (dyspnea, cough, and desaturation) and muscle weakness in both limbs after 2 months of hospitalization without rehabilitation intervention. Then, he returned to work 3 months after rehabilitation. Patient B was discharged without any significant sequelae after undergoing rehabilitation during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Early physical rehabilitation in severe cases of COVID-19 has several potential benefits, including improved muscle strength, physical function, and quality of life, as well as reduced health care costs and length of stay (LOS). We believe that an early rehabilitation program in severe cases of COVID-19 is needed, but the physician still has to consider the patients' condition and capacity into to decide what kind of exercise should be programmed by the team.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc8503797?pdf=render

Our objective was to update an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the effect size of acupuncture for 4 chronic pain conditions. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials randomized trials published up until December 31, 2015. We included randomized trials of acupuncture needling versus either sham acupuncture or no acupuncture control for nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, or shoulder pain. Trials were only included if allocation concealment was unambiguously determined to be adequate. Raw data were obtained from study authors and entered into an individual patient data meta-analysis. The main outcome measures were pain and function. An additional 13 trials were identified, with data received for a total of 20,827 patients from 39 trials. Acupuncture was superior to sham as well as no acupuncture control for each pain condition (all P < .001) with differences between groups close to .5 SDs compared with no acupuncture control and close to .2 SDs compared with sham. We also found clear evidence that the effects of acupuncture persist over time with only a small decrease, approximately 15%, in treatment effect at 1 year. In secondary analyses, we found no obvious association between trial outcome and characteristics of acupuncture treatment, but effect sizes of acupuncture were associated with the type of control group, with smaller effects sizes for sham controlled trials that used a penetrating needle for sham, and for trials that had high intensity of intervention in the control arm. We conclude that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain, with treatment effects persisting over time. Although factors in addition to the specific effects of needling at correct acupuncture point locations are important contributors to the treatment effect, decreases in pain after acupuncture cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Variations in the effect size of acupuncture in different trials are driven predominantly by differences in treatments received by the control group rather than by differences in the characteristics of acupuncture treatment.<h4>Perspective</h4>Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal, headache, and osteoarthritis pain. Treatment effects of acupuncture persist over time and cannot be explained solely in terms of placebo effects. Referral for a course of acupuncture treatment is a reasonable option for a patient with chronic pain.",

In order to improve this scoring system, the guidelines are seeking new specific parameter. The purpose of this study was to clarify the pattern of abnormalities with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia on chest computed tomography (CT) and whether the radiographic findings could distinguish M. pneumoniae pneumonia from Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review was performed of the CT findings of 64 cases and 68 cases where M. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae, respectively, were the only pathogen identified by the panel of diagnostic tests used.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 64 patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia, bronchial wall thickening was observed most frequently (81%), followed by centrilobular nodules (78%), ground-glass attenuation (78%), and consolidation (61%). Bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules were observed more often in M. pneumoniae patients than in S. pneumoniae patients (p < 0.0001). The presence of bilateral bronchial wall thickening or centrilobular nodules was only seen in patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Using the scoring system of the Japanese Respiratory Society guidelines and chest CT findings, 97% of M. pneumoniae patients were suspected to be M. pneumoniae pneumonia without serology. When comparing the CT findings between early stage and progressed stage in the same patients with severe pneumonia, the radiographic features of early stage M. pneumoniae pneumonia were not observed clearly in the progressed stage.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present results indicate that the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia would appear to be reliable when found with a combination of bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules in the CT findings. However, these CT findings are not observed in progressed severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients.",https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2342-9-7

In sepsis and septic shock, pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPS), such as bacterial exotoxins, cause direct cellular damage and/or trigger an immune response in the host often leading to excessive cytokine production, a maladaptive systemic inflammatory response syndrome response (SIRS), and tissue damage that releases DAMPs, such as activated complement and HMGB-1, into the bloodstream causing further organ injury. Cytokine reduction using extracorporeal blood filtration has been correlated with improvement in survival and clinical outcomes in experimental studies and clinical reports, but the ability of this technology to reduce a broader range of inflammatory mediators has not been well-described. This study quantifies the size-selective adsorption of a wide range of sepsis-related inflammatory bacterial and fungal PAMPs, DAMPs and cytokines, in a single compartment, in vitro whole blood recirculation system.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Purified proteins were added to whole blood at clinically relevant concentrations and recirculated through a device filled with CytoSorb® hemoadsorbent polymer beads (CytoSorbents Corporation, USA) or control (no bead) device in vitro. Except for the TNF-α trimer, hemoadsorption through porous polymer bead devices reduced the levels of a broad spectrum of cytokines, DAMPS, PAMPS and mycotoxins by more than 50 percent.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates that CytoSorb® hemoadsorbent polymer beads efficiently remove a broad spectrum of toxic PAMPS and DAMPS from blood providing an additional means of reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory cascade that contributes to a maladaptive SIRS response, organ dysfunction and death in patients with a broad range of life-threatening inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and other severe inflammatory conditions.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191676&type=printable

Only after the emergence in 2002 of SARS in human has new attention been focused on coronaviruses. As a consequence of the relatively high mutation frequency of RNA-positive stranded viruses, CCoV has evolved and, with the biomolecular techniques developed over the last two decades, new virus strains, serotypes, and subtypes have been identified in infected dogs. Considering the widespread nature of CCoV infections among dog populations, several studies have been carried out, focusing upon the epidemiological relevance of these viruses and underlining the need for further investigation into the biology of CCoVs and into the pathogenetic role of the infections.

The current study was performed to evaluate the model's performance on an independent data set.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a retrospective consecutive series of patients undergoing temporal artery biopsy (TAB) in a single health region in Canada. The model was applied to a multicenter cohort of patients undergoing TAB by a variety of surgical services. A centralized pathological database serving multiple institutions and surgical services was used to identify patients undergoing TAB.<h4>Results</h4>Over a 7-year period, patients undergoing TAB were identified via a central pathological database. Those who had concurrent illnesses which would likely affect erythrocyte sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein, and platelet count, patients on steroids for >2 weeks by the time of biopsy, and those with missing serum markers were excluded. The previously developed model was applied to the 222 patients enrolled. The model correctly identified 29% of patients with a pretest probability of 0% for a positive biopsy and 9% with a pretest probability of 100%, suggesting that in total, 38% of patients could have avoided TAB.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results of this independent data set support the previously published predictive formula. Utilizing a simple, clinically applicable predictive model of the pretest probabilities, approximately 38% of TAB currently being performed may be avoided. The results suggest that evaluation with a prospective multicentre study would be appropriate.",

Mutations in the TTN gene have been associated with different genetic disorders, including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy and several skeletal muscle diseases.Before the introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods, the molecular analysis of TTN has been laborious, expensive and not widely used, resulting in a limited number of mutations identified. Recent studies however, based on the use of NGS strategies, give evidence of an increasing number of rare and unique TTN variants. The interpretation of these rare variants of uncertain significance (VOUS) represents a challenge for clinicians and researchers.The main aim of this review is to describe the wide spectrum of muscle diseases caused by TTN mutations so far determined, summarizing the molecular findings as well as the clinical data, and to highlight the importance of joint efforts to respond to the challenges arising from the use of NGS. An international collaboration through a clinical and research consortium and the development of a single accessible database listing variants in the TTN gene, identified by high throughput approaches, may be the key to a better assessment of titinopathies and to systematic genotype- phenotype correlation studies.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5123623?pdf=render

Extracorporeal organ support is a cornerstone in the management of MOF. We report data of an advanced hemodialysis system based on albumin dialysis (ADVOS multi device) that can regulate acid-base balance in addition to the established properties of renal replacement therapy and albumin dialysis systems in critically ill patients with MOF.<h4>Methods</h4>34 critically ill patients with MOF received 102 ADVOS treatment sessions in the Department of Intensive Care Medicine of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Markers of metabolic detoxification and acid-base regulation were collected and blood gas analyses were performed. A subgroup analyses were performed in patients with severe acidemia (pH < 7.2).<h4>Results</h4>Median number of treatment sessions was 2 (range 1-9) per patient. Median duration of treatment was 17.5 (IQR 11-23) hours per session. Treatment with the ADVOS multi-albumin dialysis device caused a significant decrease in bilirubin levels, serum creatinine, BUN and ammonia levels. The relative elimination rate of bilirubin was concentration dependent. Furthermore, a significant improvement in blood pH, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and PaCO<sub>2</sub>, was achieved during ADVOS treatment including six patients that suffered from severe metabolic acidosis refractory to continuous renal replacement therapy. Delta pH, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> were significantly affected by the ADVOS blood flow rate and pH settings. This improvement in the clinical course during ADVOS treatments allowed a reduction in norepinephrine during ADVOS therapy. Treatments were well tolerated. Mortality rates were 50% and 62% for 28 and 90 days, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this case series in patients with MOF, ADVOS was able to eliminate water-soluble and albumin-bound substances. Furthermore, the device corrected severe metabolic and respiratory acid-base disequilibrium. No major adverse events associated with the ADVOS treatments were observed.",https://annalsofintensivecare.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13613-020-00714-3

It is associated with chronic medical illness, disability, bodily disfigurement, fear of loss of dignity, social isolation, and--where there is a subjective sense of incompetence--feelings of greater dependency on others or the perception of being a burden. Because of the sense of impotence or helplessness, those with the syndrome predictably progress to a desire to die or to commit suicide.

Cytokines are autocrine, which means that cells that produce them have corresponding surface receptors. The presence of these receptors makes the cells vulnerable to disruption by circulating or local sources of cytokines and related ligands. Such disruptions may explain previously poorly understood cochlear pathologies.<h4>Methods</h4>The messenger RNA precursors that encode inflammatory cytokines and related proteins are identified in the inner ear by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Cochlear cells that contain the corresponding proteins are identified by immunostaining.<h4>Results</h4>Messenger RNA for interleukin-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, NFkappaB P65 and P50, and IkappaBalpha was found in cochlear tissue. Cells that immunostained most conspicuously for cytokine production are Type I fibrocytes and root cells located within the spiral ligament.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Production of inflammatory cytokines by the above-mentioned cells indicates that they are vulnerable to disruption by extra-cochlear sources of cytokines and associated ligands. These cells play critical roles in cochlear function, and their disruption could induce hearing loss. These findings suggest that systemic or local production of inflammatory ligands may play roles in a number of causes of deafness, including immune mediated hearing loss, sudden hearing loss, and sensorineural hearing loss associated with otosclerosis, otitis media, and bacterial meningitis.",

Although cotton wool spots are caused by ischemia of the superficial capillary plexus, PAMM is caused by ischemia of the DCP, and appears as hyper-reflective, band-like lesions in the middle retina, extending from the inner nuclear layer (INL)/outer plexiform layer junction to involve the full-thickness INL. Over time, these lesions resolve with atrophy of the INL, resulting in persistent paracentral scotomas for the patient. Originally, PAMM was identified in isolation and thus classified into a subcategory of AMN. Subsequent reports have demonstrated PAMM lesions in the setting of coexisting retinal vascular disease, notably nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion.<h4>Summary</h4>PAMM refers to a recently described class of characteristic SD-OCT lesions involving the middle layers of the retina at the level of the INL. If a patient presenting with PAMM is young and healthy without any other vascular disease, this may represent a novel variant of AMN. However, if the patient has an underlying retinal vascular disease, such as diabetic retinopathy or retinal vascular occlusion, one would refer to the lesion as PAMM complicating the underlying retinal vascular disease.",

Cross-national BED data are presented here and compared with bulimia nervosa (BN) data in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health Surveys.<h4>Methods</h4>Community surveys with 24,124 respondents (ages 18+) across 14 mostly upper-middle and high-income countries assessed lifetime and 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Physical disorders were assessed with a chronic conditions checklist.<h4>Results</h4>Country-specific lifetime prevalence estimates are consistently (median; interquartile range) higher for BED (1.4%; .8-1.9%) than BN (.8%; .4-1.0%). Median age of onset is in the late teens to early 20s for both disorders but slightly younger for BN. Persistence is slightly higher for BN (6.5 years; 2.2-15.4) than BED (4.3 years; 1.0-11.7). Lifetime risk of both disorders is elevated for women and recent cohorts. Retrospective reports suggest that comorbid DSM-IV disorders predict subsequent onset of BN somewhat more strongly than BED and that BN predicts subsequent comorbid disorders somewhat more strongly than does BED. Significant comorbidities with physical conditions are due almost entirely to BN and to a somewhat lesser degree BED predicting subsequent onset of these conditions. Role impairments are similar for BN and BED. Fewer than half of lifetime BN or BED cases receive treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Binge eating disorder represents a public health problem at least equal to BN. Low treatment rates highlight the clinical importance of questioning patients about eating problems even when not included among presenting complaints.",

This human neoplasm mimics melanocytic neoplasms seen in gray horses and laboratory animals; thus, is termed animal type melanoma. It is quite rare and, with only a few reported cases, its biological behavior is not well understood. We report an example of animal type melanoma on the back of a 27-year-old man. The lesion showed areas of melanoma in situ, which ruled out the possibility of metastatic melanoma. Features of regression were also seen at dermo-epidermal junction and papillary dermis. In some areas, neoplastic melanocytes exhibited a balloon-cell appearance; in others the neoplasm was composed of sheets and fascicles of heavily pigmented epithelioid melanocytes that permeated the entire dermis and extended into the dermal-subcutaneous interface, mimicking a cellular blue nevus. Epithelioid melanocytes in deeper areas showed abundant, heavily pigmented cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and some mitotic figures. The neoplastic cells did not show evidence of maturation in deeper areas of the lesion. In some sections, a nodule of heavily pigmented epithelioid melanocytes was seen far from the main bulk of the lesion, at the dermal-subcutaneous interface, raising the possibility of a satellite lesion. A lymphoscintigraphy showed a sentinel lymph node in the right axilla and a subsequent axillary lymphadenectomy demonstrated that the architecture of the sentinel lymph node was effaced by metastatic melanoma. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with inteferon alfa-2b and four months after this treatment the patient is alive and well, without evidence of recurrences or additional metastases.",

In this study we have examined the effect of nifedipine and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on retinal blood flow velocities. Retinal blood flow was measured in 11 subjects using colour Doppler ultrasound. Nifedipine (10 mg orally) or glyceryl trinitrate (0.3 mg, GTN) was given after 30 minutes recumbancy. Systolic retinal arterial blood flow velocity (SRV), diastolic retinal arterial blood flow velocity (DRV), retinal resistive index (RI), SBP, DBP were measured at -10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes following drug administration. Nifedipine significantly increased SRV (peak effect at 15 minutes) but by 25 minutes SRV did not differ significantly from pre-drug values. Nifedipine did not significantly affect DRV, RI, SBP or DBP. GTN significantly increased both SRV and DRV, although both tended to fall towards pre-drug values by 25 minutes. RI, SBP nor DBP were not significantly altered by GTN. Both nifedipine and GTN transiently increase blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery although at the doses used neither agent affected BP or RI. Doppler ultrasound measurement of retinal arterial blood velocity may be a useful technique in the investigation of the retinal microcirculation in essential hypertension.",

It is presently unclear if delayed surgical drainage negatively affects outcomes.<h4>Study design</h4>We performed a multicenter, prospective, risk-adjusted cohort study of adult and pediatric patients with deep neck abscess who received incision and drainage within 7 days of admission in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2013 (adults) and from 2012 to 2013 (pediatrics).<h4>Methods</h4>Patients were compared based on age (≤ 18 years, > 18 years), timing of surgical drainage (day 0, day 1-2, or day 3-7), and complication rates (specifically, abscess-specific morbidity and mortality [M&M]). Multivariate regression was performed to control for preoperative differences.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1,012 cases of deep neck abscess were identified (347 adult, 665 pediatric). In adults, delay in surgical drainage was associated with increased abscess-specific M&M, from 11.5% (day 0) to 17.3% (day 1-2) to 25.0% (day 3-7) (P = 0.02). On multivariate regression, delay in drainage of ≥ 3 days in adults was associated with a 2.38-fold increase in M&M (95% confidence interval 1.01-5.59, P = 0.019). In pediatrics, there was no association between surgical delay and increased abscess-specific M&M, with rates of 5.0% (day 0), 4.0% (day 1-2), and 4.8% (day 3-7) (P = 0.68).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In adults, delay in surgical drainage of deep neck abscess is associated with increased M&M. There is no association between timing of drainage and M&M in children.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>2c. Laryngoscope, 126:1753-1760, 2016.",

For this purpose, 30 strains of the pathogen were grown in tryptone soy broth in the absence (non-adapted cultures) and presence (1% w/v; acid-adapted cultures) of glucose, and then subjected to 4-h acid challenge trials at pH 3.0. Surviving populations of each strain were determined at 1-h intervals, and the Weibull model was fitted to the derived microbiological data. Extensive variability in the acid stress responses of the tested S. enterica strains was observed, with the total population reductions (log CFU/ml) attained in 4 h of acid challenge ranging from 0.9 to 5.5 and from 0.6 to 7.0 for the non-adapted and acid-adapted cultures, respectively. As demonstrated by the model scale parameter δ and shape parameter p, the effect of acid adaptation on the inactivation curves was strain-specific. Although acid adaptation resulted in enhanced acid survival for the majority of the tested strains, there were strains exhibiting similar or decreased acid resistance compared to their non-adapted counterparts. Moreover, acid adaptation appeared to decrease the strain variability of δ whereas increasing the strain variability of p: the coefficient of variation of δ among the tested strains was 97.2 and 54.9% for the non-adapted and acid-adapted cultures, respectively, while the corresponding values for p were 12.7 and 48.1%. The data of the present study, which is the first one to systematically evaluate the adaptive ATR of multiple S. enterica strains, clearly demonstrate that this phenotype (attempted to be induced by growing the pathogen in the presence of glucose) is strain-dependent.",

It is also implicated in the pathology of several different cancer forms. The protein contains four C(2)H(2)-type zinc fingers and it specifically binds GC-rich sequences in the promoter regions of its target genes, which are either up or down regulated. Two properties make WT1 a more unusual transcription factor - an unconventional amino acid composition for zinc finger 1, and the insertion of a tri-peptide KTS in some of the splice isoforms of WT1. Using six WT1 constructs in which zinc fingers are systematically deleted, a dual study based on a bacterial 1-hybrid system and surface plasmon resonance measurements is performed. The experiments show that the effect of zinc finger 1 is not significant in terms of overall DNA-binding kinetics, however it influences both the specificity of target recognition and stability of interaction in presence of KTS. The KTS insertion, however, only mildly retards binding affinity, mainly by affecting the on-rate. We suggest that the insertion disturbs zinc finger 4 from its binding frame, thus weakening the rate of target recognition. Finally, for the construct in which both zinc fingers 1 and 4 were deleted, the two middle fingers 2-3 still could function as a 'minimal DNA-recognition domain' for WT1, however the formation of a stable protein-DNA complex is impaired since the overall affinity was dramatically reduced mainly since the off-rate was severely affected.",

The CTG repeats in genomic DNA samples from 10 DM1 cell lines were characterized in three clinical genetic testing laboratories using PCR and Southern blot analysis. DMPK alleles in the samples cover four of five DM1 clinical categories: normal (5 to 34 repeats), mild (50 to 100 repeats), classical (101 to 1000 repeats), and congenital (>1000 repeats). We did not identify or establish Coriell cell lines in the premutation range (35 to 49 repeats).

The condition is characterised by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus. Needle aspiration and incision and drainage are the two main treatment modalities currently used in the treatment of this condition. The effectiveness of one versus the other has not been clearly demonstrated and remains an area of debate.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effectiveness and risks of needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess in older children (eight years of age or older), adolescents and adults.<h4>Search methods</h4>The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 25 August 2016.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials comparing needle aspiration with incision and drainage.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were recurrence rate (proportion of patients needing repeat intervention) and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Secondary outcomes were time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 11 studies (674 participants). The risk of bias was high or unclear in all of the included studies. All studies compared needle aspiration to incision and drainage.All but one of the 11 studies reported on the primary outcome of recurrence. When we pooled data from the 10 studies the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage: risk ratio (RR) 3.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 8.59; 612 participants). We detected moderate heterogeneity in this analysis (I<sup>2</sup> = 48%). In interpreting the pooled result it is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of very low quality.None of the other outcomes (adverse effects of the intervention, time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores) were consistently measured across all studies.Only three studies reported on adverse effects/events associated with the intervention and only one such event in a single patient was reported (post-procedure bleeding following incision and drainage: 1/28, 3.6%) (very low-quality evidence). Time to resumption of normal diet was compared in two studies; neither found an obvious difference between needle aspiration and incision and drainage (very low-quality evidence).Only three studies stated that they would report complications of the disease process. In these three studies, the only complication reported was admission to hospital for dehydration in two patients who underwent incision and drainage (2/13, 6.7%). Symptom scores were measured in four studies; three evaluated pain using different scales and one other symptoms. The data could not be pooled in a meta-analysis. Two studies evaluating procedural pain reported this to be lower in the needle aspiration groups. One study found comparable rates of pain resolution at five days post-intervention between groups. The quality of the evidence for symptom scores was very low.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Although a number of studies have sought to evaluate whether or not needle aspiration or incision and drainage is more effective in patients with peritonsillar abscess, there is no high-quality evidence to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn and the answer remains uncertain. Very low-quality evidence suggests that incision and drainage may be associated with a lower chance of recurrence than needle aspiration. There is some very low-quality evidence to suggest that needle aspiration is less painful.",

Metformin, along with other drugs in the biguanide class, increases plasma lactate levels in a plasma concentration-dependent manner by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration predominantly in the liver. Elevated plasma metformin concentrations (as occur in individuals with renal impairment) and a secondary event or condition that further disrupts lactate production or clearance (e.g., cirrhosis, sepsis, or hypoperfusion), are typically necessary to cause metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). As these secondary events may be unpredictable and the mortality rate for MALA approaches 50%, metformin has been contraindicated in moderate and severe renal impairment since its FDA approval in patients with normal renal function or mild renal insufficiency to minimize the potential for toxic metformin levels and MALA. However, the reported incidence of lactic acidosis in clinical practice has proved to be very low (<10 cases per 100,000 patient-years). Several groups have suggested that current renal function cutoffs for metformin are too conservative, thus depriving a substantial number of type 2 diabetes patients from the potential benefit of metformin therapy. On the other hand, the success of metformin as the first-line diabetes therapy may be a direct consequence of conservative labeling, the absence of which could have led to excess patient risk and eventual withdrawal from the market, as happened with earlier biguanide therapies. An investigational delayed-release metformin currently under development could potentially provide a treatment option for patients with renal impairment pending the results of future studies. This literature-based review provides an update on the impact of renal function and other conditions on metformin plasma levels and the risk of MALA in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

The aim of this study was to report the clinicopathological characteristics of 14 cases of animal type melanoma.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Six patients were female and eight were male with ages ranging from 5 to 52 years (mean 31 years, median 39 years). The head and neck represented the most common site. The clinical diagnosis was of melanoma in seven cases, blue naevus in three cases, benign naevus in three cases and a pigmented basal cell carcinoma in one case. The histological diagnosis of PSM was predicated on the basis of an asymmetrical, predominantly intradermal tumour formed of deeply pigmented, round or short, spindle-shaped dendritic melanocytes with some degree of hyperchromatism and a single nucleolus. Cytological atypia was always present but was not pronounced. A prominent population of macrophages was invariably present. Four tumours were compound and 10 tumours were predominantly intradermal. The mitotic count was usually low, ranging from 1 to 5 per 10 high-power fields (mean 2). Perineural and lymphovascular invasion was not seen. The Breslow thickness ranged from 1.1 to 7.5 mm (mean 3.3 mm). Follow-up was available in 13 patients. The median follow-up period was 5 years. Six patients had no recurrence, three had local recurrence in the form of satellite nodules adjacent to the scar, four had spread to the regional lymph nodes and one patient had distant metastases to the liver. There were no deaths.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates that PSM is a distinctive, possible low-grade variant of melanoma usually lacking the histological features predictive of aggressive behaviour seen in ordinary melanoma. It should be managed in the same way as other melanomas with wide local excision.",

This definition has become accepted widely by health care professionals and researchers in the pain field and adopted by several professional, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization. In recent years, some in the field have reasoned that advances in our understanding of pain warrant a reevaluation of the definition and have proposed modifications. Therefore, in 2018, the IASP formed a 14-member, multinational Presidential Task Force comprising individuals with broad expertise in clinical and basic science related to pain, to evaluate the current definition and accompanying note and recommend whether they should be retained or changed. This review provides a synopsis of the critical concepts, the analysis of comments from the IASP membership and public, and the committee's final recommendations for revisions to the definition and notes, which were discussed over a 2-year period. The task force ultimately recommended that the definition of pain be revised to ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage,"" and that the accompanying notes be updated to a bulleted list that included the etymology. The revised definition and notes were unanimously accepted by the IASP Council early this year.",

He was initially treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg), systemic methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil. Three months later, his BCVA improved to 20/70 OU with slight improvement of retinal ischemia on FA. Nicotinic acid was added to his treatment regimen. Due to logistic challenges, he did not receive infliximab treatment during the subsequent three months. However, three months after beginning nicotinic acid therapy, FA revealed significant improvement of his retinal ischemia OU. <b>Conclusion:</b> To our knowledge, the index report is the first to show that nicotinic acid may improve retinal ischemia in vaso-occlusive retinal vasculitis and be an integral part of the treatment regimen of this sight-threatening condition.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7878990?pdf=render
1065,19552797,Ozone and cardiovascular injury.,10.1186/1476-7120-7-30,"Srebot V, Gianicolo EA, Rainaldi G, Trivella MG, Sicari R.",2009,Cardiovascular ultrasound,"Air pollution is increasingly recognized as an important and modifiable determinant of cardiovascular diseases in urban communities. The potential detrimental effects are both acute and chronic having a strong impact on morbidity and mortality. The acute exposure to pollutants has been linked to adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias. The long-terms effects are related to the lifetime risk of death from cardiac causes. The WHO estimates that air pollution is responsible for 3 million premature deaths each year. The evidence supporting these data is very strong nonetheless, epidemiologic and observational data have the main limitation of imprecise measurements. Moreover, the lack of clinical experimental models makes it difficult to demonstrate the individual risk. The other limitation is related to the lack of a clear mechanism explaining the effects of pollution on cardiovascular mortality. In the present review we will explore the epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence of the effects of ozone on cardiovascular diseases. The pathophysiologic consequences of air pollutant exposures have been extensively investigated in pulmonary systems, and it is clear that some of the major components of air pollution (e.g. ozone and particulate matter) can initiate and exacerbate lung disease in humans 1. It is possible that pulmonary oxidant stress mediated by particulate matter and/or ozone (O3) exposure can result in downstream perturbations in the cardiovasculature, as the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems are intricately associated, and it is well documented that specific environmental toxins (such as tobacco smoke 2) introduced through the lungs can initiate and/or accelerate cardiovascular disease development. Indeed, several epidemiologic studies have proved that there is an association between PM and O3 and the increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 3. Most of the evidence comes from studies of ambient particles concentrations. However, in Europe and elsewhere, the air pollution profile has gradually changed toward a more pronounced photochemical component. Ozone is one of the most toxic components of the photochemical air pollution mixture. Indeed, the biological basis for these observations has not been elucidated. In the present review, the role of ozone as chemical molecule will be firstly considered. Secondly, pathogenetic mechanisms connecting the atmospheric ozone level and cardiovascular pathology will be examined. Thirdly, the literature relating hospitalization frequency, morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular causes and ozone concentration will be studied. The correlation between ozone level and occurrence of acute myocardial infarction will be eventually discussed.",https://cardiovascularultrasound.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1476-7120-7-30

Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) therapy has shown beneficial effects for specific symptoms of liver failure; however, general survival advantages have not yet been demonstrated.<h4>Aim</h4>We studied the effects of MARS therapy compared to standard medical treatment (SMT) in two patient cohorts: in patients with an acute liver injury and in those with graft dysfunction (GD).<h4>Methods</h4>We report on our experience over a 6.5-year period with 73 patients treated with SMT or with SMT and MARS (MARS group). In total, 53 patients suffered from acute liver injury in their native liver without a preexisting liver disease (SMT: n = 31, MARS: n = 22), and 20 patients showed a severe GD after LT (SMT: n = 10, MARS: n = 10).<h4>Results</h4>The entire cohort was predominantly characterized by hemodynamically and respiratorily stable patients with a low hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grade and a model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 20.57 (MARS) or 22.51 (SMT, p = 0.555). Within the MARS group, the median number of extracorporeal therapy sessions was four (range = 3-5 sessions). Independent of the underlying etiology, MARS improved the patients' bilirubin values in the short term compared to SMT alone. In patients with acute liver injury, this response was sustained even after the end of MARS therapy. By contrast, the majority of patients with GD and an initial response to MARS therapy experienced worsened hyperbilirubinemia. No differences in 28-day mortality were observed with respect to acute liver injury (MARS 5.3% (95% CI: 0-15.3); SMT 3.3% (95% CI: 0-9.8), p = 0.754) or GD (MARS 20.0% (95% CI: 0-44.7), SMT 11.1% (95% CI: 0-31.7), p = 0.478).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although it did not improve 28-day mortality, MARS therapy improved the short-term response in patients with acute liver injury as well as in those with GD. In cases of acute hepatic injury, the use of MARS therapy resulted in the sustained stabilization of liver function and improved liver regeneration. A short-term response to MARS may predict the future course of the disease.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175529&type=printable

In an international randomized trial, LCH-II, we intensified their treatment: arm A consisted of 6 weeks of daily prednisone and weekly vinblastine followed by 18 weeks of daily 6-mercaptopurine with vinblastine/prednisone pulses; etoposide was added in arm B. Considering all 193 randomized risk patients, there were similar outcomes: rapid (6 weeks) response (arm A vs arm B: 63%/71%), 5-year survival probability (74%/79%), disease reactivation frequency (46%/46%), and permanent consequences (43%/37%). However, (1) patients younger than 2 years without RO involvement (RO(-)) had 100% survival and uniformly high (> 80%) rapid response, (2) RO(+) patients not responding within 6 weeks had highest mortality, and (3) importantly, the more intensive arm B reduced mortality in RO(+) patients (relative hazard rate, accounting for differences in risk organ involvement, of 0.54; 95% CI = 0.29-1.00). Finally, comparison of RO(+) patients in LCH-I and LCH-II confirmed that increasing treatment intensity increased rapid responses (from 43% in arm A LCH-I to 68% in arm B LCH-II; P = .027) and reduced mortality (from 44% in arm A LCH-I to 27% in arm B LCH-II; P = .042). We conclude that intensified treatment significantly increases rapid response and reduces mortality in risk MS-LCH. This trial was registered at http://www.controlled-trials.com as no.

The abnormality of the venous system, the underlying embryologic disorder and the outcome of the pregnancy are presented and compared with the literature.<h4>Results</h4>In group A, eight fetuses had an abnormal course of the umbilical vein with a patent (n = 3) or absent (n = 5) ductus venosus. No portal veins and absent or abnormal hepatic veins were visualized by color Doppler sonography. Six fetuses (75%) did not have an associated malformation and have survived. Two pregnancies with fetal hydrops due to a small heart and to Turner's syndrome were terminated or ended in fetal demise. In group B, seven of eight fetuses with an abnormal caval system had a situs ambiguus or an atrial isomerism. A cardiac defect was detected in six cases (86%). These six pregnancies ended in four terminations of pregnancy and two infant deaths due to the severity of the congenital cardiac defect. One child with a normal heart and a child with an isolated abnormal course of the lower inferior vena cava are developing well.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In a targeted fetal scan the course of the umbilical vein, ductus venosus, the portal and hepatic veins and inferior vena cava should be carefully examined using color Doppler. Any suspicious finding should be followed by a detailed assessment of the specificity of this abnormality taking into consideration the embryologic development of the fetal venous system together with the associated malformations.",

However, the efficacy of rTMS in bipolar disorder (BD) is unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy and tolerability of rTMS for both depressive and manic phases in BD.<h4>Methods</h4>MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL databases were searched for controlled trials on treatment of BD with rTMS. Primary outcomes included changes in depression or mania scores, response and remission rates. Secondary outcomes included quality of life and functioning assessment. We used random-effects model, Hedge's g, risk differences (RDs) and the number needed to treat (NNT).<h4>Results</h4>Eleven randomized sham-controlled studies were included, with a total of 345 patients with BD (bipolar depression = 257, mania = 86, mixed affective = 2). Trials of rTMS in bipolar depression (N = 8) demonstrated small but significant improvement in depression scores [standardized mean difference = 0.302, p < 0.05], compared to control group. Furthermore, rTMS brought a higher remission rate than sham-controls [RD = 0.104 ± 0.044, p < 0.05, NNT = 10; and a trend of greater response rate [RD = 0.074 ± 0.039, p = 0.06]. Results were inconclusive for effect of rTMS in mania. In both depressive and manic groups, no serious adverse events were reported. Risk of treatment-emergent mania appeared low.<h4>Limitations</h4>There was limited number of eligible primary studies, with variable randomization procedures.<h4>Conclusion</h4>rTMS appears safe and effective in treating bipolar depression. More stringent RCTs are necessary for concrete conclusion about efficacy in mania.",

We report a case of occult insufficiency fracture of the femoral neck without conditions predisposing to insufficiency fractures, occurring in association with ONFH.<h4>Presentation of case</h4>We report a case of occult fracture of the femoral neck due to extensive ONFH in a 60-year-old man. No abnormal findings suggestive of ONFH were identified on radiographs, and the fracture occurred spontaneously without any trauma or unusual increase in activity. The patient's medical history, age, and good bone quality suggested ONFH as a possible underlying cause. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was useful in determining whether the fracture was caused by ONFH or was instead a simple insufficiency fracture caused by steroid use.<h4>Discussion</h4>The patient was treated with bipolar hemiarthroplasty, but if we had not suspected ONFH as a predisposing condition, the undisplaced fracture might have been treated by osteosynthesis, and this would have led to nonunion or collapse of the femoral head. To avoid providing improper treatment, clinicians should consider ONFH as a predisposing factor in pathologic fractures of the femoral neck.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ONFH should be included in the differential diagnosis of insufficiency fracture of the femoral neck.",

From 2005 to 2014, new episodes of meningitis, mastoiditis, and peritonsillar abscess decreased annually by 5.3%, 4.6%, and 1.0%, respectively, whereas new episodes of pneumonia increased by 0.4%. Age and sex standardised incidences for pneumonia and peritonsillar abscess were higher for practices in the lowest fourth of antibiotic prescribing compared with the highest fourth. The adjusted relative risk increases for a 10% reduction in antibiotic prescribing were 12.8% (95% confidence interval 7.8% to 17.5%, P<0.001) for pneumonia and 9.9% (5.6% to 14.0%, P<0.001) for peritonsillar abscess. If a general practice with an average list size of 7000 patients reduces the proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotics prescribed by 10%, then it might observe 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.5) more cases of pneumonia each year and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.3) more cases of peritonsillar abscess each decade. Mastoiditis, empyema, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and Lemierre's syndrome were similar in frequency at low prescribing and high prescribing practices.<h4>Conclusions</h4> General practices that adopt a policy to reduce antibiotic prescribing for RTIs might expect a slight increase in the incidence of treatable pneumonia and peritonsillar abscess. No increase is likely in mastoiditis, empyema, bacterial meningitis, intracranial abscess, or Lemierre's syndrome. Even a substantial reduction in antibiotic prescribing was predicted to be associated with only a small increase in numbers of cases observed overall, but caution might be required in subgroups at higher risk of pneumonia.",https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/354/bmj.i3410.full.pdf

All underwent cardiac surgery during which their diagnosis was confirmed. The etiology, location, 2-dimensional morphology, and color Doppler findings of IVS dissection were noted.The right sinus of Valsalva (SOV) was involved in 11 of the 13 patients. In 5 patients, a single aneurysm of the right SOV was seen dissecting into the IVS. One patient with a combination of a bicuspid aortic valve and a right SOV aneurysm dissected into the IVS. In 4 patients, aortic valve infective endocarditis resulted in IVS dissection. In 1 patient, mechanical aortic valve prosthetic replacement was complicated by annular detachment and a severe paravalvular leak causing IVS dissection. In all 11 patients, TTE showed a dissecting cystic-like mass in the IVS from the base to the mid-septum or confined to the septal base. The path of the dissection in these 11 patients was traced to the right SOV and communications between the IVS dissection and the aortic root were identified. In the remaining 2 patients, IVS dissection followed septal rupture due to a myocardial infarction, and communication was seen between the IVS dissection and the right ventricle.The study showed that most of the dissections of the IVS commence in the right SOV, due to either congenital anomalies or infective endocarditis, or following aortic valve replacement or myocardial infarction.

Extracorporeal clearance of hepatotoxic metabolites, including bilirubin and ammonia, aims to attenuate further hepatocyte damage and liver injury, resulting in decreased mortality. The efficacy of hemadsorption combined with conventional hemodialysis to eliminate bilirubin and ammonia to support the liver's excretory function in acute liver injury has been described previously. However, the optimal use of liver support systems in chronic liver dysfunction due to secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) has not been defined yet. We herein describe the kinetics of successful bilirubin and ammonia elimination by hemadsorption in a patient with SSC-CIP after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the course of the disease, the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before clinically detectable jaundice or elevated bilirubin levels. A diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) based on intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts. The patient showed stable elevations of bilirubin and ammonia levels thereafter, but presented with progressive nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion. Based on these laboratory findings, hemadsorption was combined with hemodialysis treatment and successfully eliminated bilirubin and ammonia. Moreover, direct comparison revealed that ammonia is more efficiently eliminated by hemadsorption than bilirubin levels. Clinical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion improved. In summary, bilirubin and ammonia were successfully eliminated by hemadsorption combined with hemodialysis treatment in SSC-CIP following ECMO therapy and severe COVID-19. This observation is particularly relevant since it has been reported that a considerable subset of critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffer from liver dysfunction associated with high mortality.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8698542?pdf=render

Here, we present the case of a 6-week-old baby girl who presented with mild hyponatraemia and dehydration with a background of severe failure to thrive. At presentation, urinary sodium was not measurably increased, but plasma aldosterone and renin were increased, and continued to rise during the subsequent week. Despite high calorie feeds the infant weight gain and hyponatraemia did not improve until salt supplements were commenced. Subsequently, the karyotype was reported as 46,XX,inv (4)(q31.2q35). A search of the OMIM database for related genes at or near the inversion breakpoints, showed that the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C2) at 4q31.23 was a likely candidate. Further FISH analysis showed findings consistent with disruption of the NR3C2 gene by the proximal breakpoint (4q31.23) of the inversion. There was no evidence of deletion or duplication at or near the breakpoint. This is the first report of a structural chromosome disruption of the NR3C2 gene giving rise to the classical clinical manifestations of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 in an infant.",

The role of extracorporeal treatments such as hemodialysis is poorly defined at present. Here, the Extracorporeal Treatments In Poisoning workgroup, comprising international experts representing diverse professions, presents its systematic review and clinical recommendations for extracorporeal treatment in metformin poisoning.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was performed, data extracted, findings summarized, and structured voting statements developed. A two-round modified Delphi method was used to achieve consensus on voting statements and RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to quantify disagreement. Anonymized votes and opinions were compiled and discussed. A second vote determined the final recommendations.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred seventy-five articles were identified, including 63 deaths: one observational study, 160 case reports or series, 11 studies of descriptive cohorts, and three pharmacokinetic studies in end-stage renal disease, yielding a very low quality of evidence for all recommendations. The workgroup concluded that metformin is moderately dialyzable (level of evidence C) and made the following recommendations: extracorporeal treatment is recommended in severe metformin poisoning (1D). Indications for extracorporeal treatment include lactate concentration greater than 20 mmol/L (1D), pH less than or equal to 7.0 (1D), shock (1D), failure of standard supportive measures (1D), and decreased level of consciousness (2D). Extracorporeal treatment should be continued until the lactate concentration is less than 3 mmol/L (1D) and pH greater than 7.35 (1D), at which time close monitoring is warranted to determine the need for additional courses of extracorporeal treatment. Intermittent hemodialysis is preferred initially (1D), but continuous renal replacement therapies may be considered if hemodialysis is unavailable (2D). Repeat extracorporeal treatment sessions may use hemodialysis (1D) or continuous renal replacement therapy (1D).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Metformin poisoning with lactic acidosis appears to be amenable to extracorporeal treatments. Despite clinical evidence comprised mostly of case reports and suboptimal toxicokinetic data, the workgroup recommended extracorporeal removal in the case of severe metformin poisoning.",

BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and is currently approved, conditionally approved, or authorized for emergency use worldwide. At the time of initial authorization, data beyond 2 months after vaccination were unavailable.<h4>Methods</h4>In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned 44,165 participants 16 years of age or older and 2264 participants 12 to 15 years of age to receive two 30-μg doses, at 21 days apart, of BNT162b2 or placebo. The trial end points were vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety, which were both evaluated through 6 months after vaccination.<h4>Results</h4>BNT162b2 continued to be safe and have an acceptable adverse-event profile. Few participants had adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 91.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.0 to 93.2) through 6 months of follow-up among the participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be evaluated. There was a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy of 86 to 100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse ages, sexes, race or ethnic groups, and risk factors for Covid-19 among participants without evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.3 to 99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.351 (or beta) was predominant, a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 53.5 to 100) was observed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing Covid-19.

However, up-front resistance as well as relapse following initial response demonstrates the need for a deeper understanding of resistance mechanisms. In the present study, we report that responses to venetoclax +azacitidine in patients with AML correlate closely with developmental stage, where phenotypically primitive AML is sensitive, but monocytic AML is more resistant. Mechanistically, resistant monocytic AML has a distinct transcriptomic profile, loses expression of venetoclax target BCL2, and relies on MCL1 to mediate oxidative phosphorylation and survival. This differential sensitivity drives a selective process in patients which favors the outgrowth of monocytic subpopulations at relapse. Based on these findings, we conclude that resistance to venetoclax + azacitidine can arise due to biological properties intrinsic to monocytic differentiation. We propose that optimal AML therapies should be designed so as to independently target AML subclones that may arise at differing stages of pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying characteristics of patients who respond poorly to venetoclax-based therapy and devising alternative therapeutic strategies for such patients are important topics in AML. We show that venetoclax resistance can arise due to intrinsic molecular/metabolic properties of monocytic AML cells and that such properties can potentially be targeted with alternative strategies.",

Through the use of real-time audio-visual interaction, imaging, and store-and-forward systems, a greater proportion of neurologists are able to meet the demand for specialty care in underserved communities, decrease the response time for acute stroke assessment, and expand the collaboration between primary care physicians, neurologists, and other disciplines. The American Stroke Association has developed a defined policy on teleneurology, and the American Academy of Neurology and federal health care policy are beginning to follow suit.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Teleneurology is an effective tool for the rapid evaluation of patients in remote locations requiring neurologic care. These underserved locations include geographically isolated rural areas as well as urban cores with insufficient available neurology specialists. With this technology, neurologists will be better able to meet the burgeoning demand for access to neurologic care in an era of declining availability. An increase in physician awareness and support at the federal and state level is necessary to facilitate expansion of telemedicine into further areas of neurology.",

Experimental studies and sporadic reports have confirmed susceptibility of dogs and cats to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the importance of pet animals in the epidemiology of this infection is unclear. This study reports on a first large-scale serosurvey of SARS-CoV-2 infections in dogs and cats in Europe. From 26 February 2020, just one day after the first confirmed human case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Croatia, to 15 June 2020, dog and cat serum samples were collected from animals admitted to three veterinary facilities in Croatia. Additionally, on 25 May 2020, a total of 122 serum samples from employees of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine University of Zagreb were collected. Total of 656 dogs and 131 cat serum samples were tested using an in-house microneutralisation test (MNT). Human serum samples, as well as 172 randomly selected, dog sera were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA-positive human sera were subsequently tested using MNT. Neutralising antibodies were confirmed in 0.76% cats and 0.31% dogs. ELISA reactivity was recorded in 7.56% tested dog sera. On the other hand, 5.19% of administrative, basic and pre-clinical sciences department personnel and 5.13% of animal health service providers and laboratory personnel tested ELISA positive. Neutralising antibodies were not confirmed in any of the human samples. In conclusion, seropositivity among pet animals in Croatia is low, especially when compared to results from China. A small number of seropositive animals with a low titre of neutralising antibodies suggest infections are rare and are following infections in the human population. Additionally, contact with animals does not seem to be an occupational risk for veterinary practitioners.",

Only a few reports have been published, which may be due to its misdiagnosis. We review here a series of eight cases. When first diagnosed they were 4-29 months of age. They were fed CM from birth and their chronic respiratory symptoms began at age 1-9 months. The symptoms were in the form of cough in seven, wheezing in three, hemoptysis in two, nasal congestion in three, dyspnea in one, recurrent otitis media (OM) in three, recurrent fever in four, anorexia, vomiting, colic or diarrhea in five, hematochezia in one, and failure to thrive (FTT) in two. All had radiologic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. High titers of precipitating antibodies to CM proteins were demonstrated in six of six and milk-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) was positive in one of two. Pulmonary hemosiderosis (PH) was confirmed in one patient who showed iron-laden macrophages (ILM) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), gastric washing, and open lung biopsy. Additional findings, in a descending frequency, were eosinophilia, anemia, and elevated level of total IgM, IgE or IgA. Milk elimination resulted in remarkable improvement in symptoms within days and clearing of the pulmonary infiltrate within weeks. Parents consented to milk challenge in only three cases, all of whom developed recurrence of symptoms. After 2 yr of milk avoidance in one patient, milk challenge was tolerated for 2 months, and then the patient developed symptoms, serum milk precipitins, pulmonary infiltrate, and ILM. The HS should be suspected in young children with chronic pulmonary disease of obscure cause. The diagnosis is supported with a positive milk precipitin test and improvement on a trial of milk elimination. Severe cases may be complicated with PH, which should be suspected in the presence of anemia or hemoptysis and be confirmed with the demonstration of ILM.",

Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) with Haldane's adjustment and odds ratio with Cornfield 95% confidence intervals.<h4>Results</h4>Precipitating antibodies against the Ro(SS-A) antigen, determined by gel double-immunodiffusion, were present in an increased frequency in CNS-SS patients with (1) documented clinical CNS disease, (2) focal clinical CNS manifestations and serious complications, (3) large regions of increased signal intensity, consistent with ischemia/infarcts on brain MRI scans or regions of decreased attenuation consistent with infarcts on CT, and (4) abnormal cerebral angiograms consistent with small-vessel angiitis. Finally, the anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody response in CNS was directed against the 60-kd peptide specificity, determined by ELISA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Clinical, neuroimaging (cerebral CT), and angiographic observation suggest that a subset of anti-Ro(SS-A) antibody-positive, in contrast with -negative, CNS-SS patients have more serious and extensive CNS disease, some with frank cerebral angiopathy. Anti-Ro(SS-A) antibodies are postulated to play a role in mediating or potentiating vascular injury in CNS-SS.",

Treatment regimens are controversial, especially in specific populations, and assessing treatment response based on serology remains a challenge.<h4>Objective</h4>To review evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens, implications of the ""serofast state,"" and treatment of specific populations including those with neurosyphilis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pregnant women.<h4>Evidence review</h4>We searched MEDLINE for English-language human treatment studies dating from January 1965 until July 2014. The American Heart Association classification system was used to rate quality of evidence.<h4>Findings</h4>We included 102 articles in our review, consisting of randomized trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies. Case reports and small series were excluded unless they were the only studies providing evidence for a specific treatment strategy. We included 11 randomized trials. Evidence regarding penicillin and nonpenicillin regimens was reviewed from studies involving 11,102 patients. Data on the treatment of early syphilis support the use of a single intramuscular injection of 2.4 million U of benzathine penicillin G, with studies reporting 90% to 100% treatment success rates. The value of multiple-dose treatment of early syphilis is uncertain, especially in HIV-infected individuals. Less evidence is available regarding therapy for late and late latent syphilis. Following treatment, nontreponemal serologic titers should decline in a stable pattern, but a significant proportion of patients may remain seropositive (the ""serofast state""). Serologic response to treatment should be evident by 6 months in early syphilis but is generally slower (12-24 months) for latent syphilis. Evidence defining treatment for HIV-infected persons and for pregnant women is limited, but available data support penicillin as first-line therapy.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>The mainstay of syphilis treatment is parenteral penicillin G despite the relatively modest clinical trial data that support its use.",

Neurology,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a continuous endothelial membrane within brain microvessels that has sealed cell-to-cell contacts and is sheathed by mural vascular cells and perivascular astrocyte end-feet. The BBB protects neurons from factors present in the systemic circulation and maintains the highly regulated CNS internal milieu, which is required for proper synaptic and neuronal functioning. BBB disruption allows influx into the brain of neurotoxic blood-derived debris, cells and microbial pathogens and is associated with inflammatory and immune responses, which can initiate multiple pathways of neurodegeneration. This Review discusses neuroimaging studies in the living human brain and post-mortem tissue as well as biomarker studies demonstrating BBB breakdown in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, HIV-1-associated dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms by which BBB breakdown leads to neuronal injury, synaptic dysfunction, loss of neuronal connectivity and neurodegeneration are described. The importance of a healthy BBB for therapeutic drug delivery and the adverse effects of disease-initiated, pathological BBB breakdown in relation to brain delivery of neuropharmaceuticals are briefly discussed. Finally, future directions, gaps in the field and opportunities to control the course of neurological diseases by targeting the BBB are presented.",

Extracorporeal liver support (ECLS) devices have been used as a bridge to liver transplant; however, the efficacy and safety of ECLS are unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the efficacy and safety of ECLS in liver failure.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through March 13, 2019. RCTs comparing ECLS to usual care in ALF or ACLF were included. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 25 RCTs (1796 patients). ECLS use was associated with reduction in mortality (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74, 0.96, moderate certainty) and improvement in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.60, 0.84, low certainty) in patients with ALF or ACLF. The effect of ECLS on hypotension (RR 1.46; 95% CI 0.98, 2.2, low certainty), bleeding (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.88, 1.66, moderate certainty), thrombocytopenia (RR 1.62; 95% CI 1.0, 2.64, very low certainty) and line infection (RR 1.92; 95% CI 0.11, 33.44, low certainty) was uncertain.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ECLS may reduce mortality and improve HE in patients with ALF and ACLF. The effect on other outcomes is uncertain. However, the evidence is limited by risk of bias and imprecision, and larger trials are needed to better determine the effect of ECLS on patient-important outcomes.",

The incidence of MS is increasing worldwide, together with the socioeconomic impact of the disease. The underlying cause of MS and mechanisms behind this increase remain opaque, although complex gene-environment interactions almost certainly play a significant role. The epidemiology of MS indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood obesity and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus are likely to play a role in disease development. Changes in diagnostic methods and criteria mean that people with MS can be diagnosed increasingly early in their disease trajectory. Alongside this, treatments for MS have increased exponentially in number, efficacy and risk. There is now the possibility of a diagnosis of 'pre-symptomatic MS' being made; as a result potentially preventive strategies could be studied. In this comprehensive review, MS epidemiology, potential aetiological factors and pathology are discussed, before moving on to clinical aspects of MS diagnosis and management.",

It is usually asymptomatic and detected incidentally on radiological imaging. Imaging features are similar to hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and malignant lymphoma and are not specific for pseudolymphoma of the liver. Percutaneous core biopsy is insufficient to distinguish pseudolymphoma of the liver from low-grade malignant lymphoma and extranodal marginal lymphomas.<h4>Case descriptions</h4>In this article, we present a case of hepatic RLH of a patient who was presented with a skin rash on the leg and was detected incidentally on radiological imaging.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Preoperative definitive diagnosis of hepatic RLH using various imaging methods, including MRI with hepatocellular agents, is highly difficult.",

Four patients had their surgery via a translabyrinthine approach. Two patients had a retrosigmoid approach. A cochlear implant was inserted at the same time as tumor removal in 4 cases and sequentially in 2 cases.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Surgical and audiometric outcomes using Bamford-Kowal-Bench (BKB) and City of New York University (CUNY) sentence scores.<h4>Results</h4>The average age at implantation was 24 years (range, 15-36 yr). Follow-up ranged from 5 to 93 months, with an average of 38 months. All patients had useful hearing in the contralateral ear before surgery. One patient gained no benefit from cochlear implantation and proceeded to have an auditory brainstem implant. Of those that had functional cochlear nerves, the average BKB score in quiet was 64%, BKB score in noise was 42%, and CUNY score with lipreading was 97%. Results varied within the group, but all patients gained significant benefit and continue to use their CI at least intermittantly.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present series demonstrates that in selected cases, cochlear implantation can be successful after a translabyrinthine approach for VS removal and for restoring hearing after failed retrosigmoid hearing preservation surgery.

Our goals were to describe the etiology, management and outcomes of such patients identified between 2006 and 2009 and to compare them with a similar historical study published in 1982.<h4>Methods</h4>Chart review was performed on 49 patients with AKRI secondary to BUO. ARKI was defined as ≥33% decrease in serum creatinine after intervention. Those with malignant and benign causes of obstruction were identified and management and outcome data were collected.<h4>Results</h4>Of these 49 patients, 83% had BUO secondary to malignancy, 28% of these presenting for the first time. Prevalence of bladder cancer was increased (p = 0.04) and cervix trended lower (p = 0.07) compared with the earlier study; prostate cancer was unchanged (p = 0.51). The average survival was 239 days; 90% of patients died within a year after presenting with BUO from a malignant etiology. Compared with the 1982 group, there were trends towards a decrease in the frequency of retroperitoneal fibrosis (p = 0.08) and an increase in bilateral ureteric calculi (p = 0.16) in the benign group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with ARKI secondary to BUO most likely have an underlying malignancy, with almost a third of them being diagnosed for the first time. Prevalence of bladder cancer increased while cervical cancer trended lower. The cause for the former is unclear; the latter may be due to aggressive screening. Prostate cancer remained unchanged despite the widespread implementation of prostate-specific antigen testing. Patients with an underlying malignancy do poorly and those with a newly diagnosed malignancy do worst. Those with ARKI secondary to benign causes did well.",

Cytogenetic analyses were successfully performed in 2072 (97.6%) patients, revealing clonal abnormalities in 1084 (52.3%) patients. Numeric and structural chromosomal abnormalities were documented for each patient and subdivided further according to the number of additional abnormalities. Thus, 684 different cytogenetic categories were identified. The impact of the karyotype on the natural course of the disease was studied in 1286 patients treated with supportive care only. Median survival was 53.4 months for patients with normal karyotypes (n = 612) and 8.7 months for those with complex anomalies (n = 166).

Treatment of patients suffering chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with this BCL-2 antagonist has revealed emergence of a drug-selected BCL-2 mutation (G101V) in some patients failing therapy. To understand the molecular basis of this acquired resistance we describe the crystal structures of venetoclax bound to both BCL-2 and the G101V mutant. The pose of venetoclax in its binding site on BCL-2 reveals small but unexpected differences as compared to published structures of complexes with venetoclax analogues. The G101V mutant complex structure and mutant binding assays reveal that resistance is acquired by a knock-on effect of V101 on an adjacent residue, E152, with venetoclax binding restored by a E152A mutation. This provides a framework for considering analogues of venetoclax that might be effective in combating this mutation.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6547681?pdf=render

Recently, expression of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and the paired box gene 5 (PAX 5) has been consistently reported in the majority of MCCs. We tested 21 MCCs for the expression of MCPyV, TdT, PAX5, IgG, IgM, IgA, kappa, and lambda by immunohistochemistry and assessed IgH and Igk rearrangement in all 21 MCCs. All of the MCCs revealed specific expression of PAX5 and 72.8% of the MCCs expressed TdT. In addition, most of the MCCs revealed specific expression of one or more Ig subclasses and kappa or lambda. One MCC did reveal monoclonal IgH and Igk rearrangement next to two other MCCs showing Igk rearrangement. As coexpression of TdT and PAX5 under physiologic circumstances is restricted to pro/pre- and pre-B cells we propose, on the basis of our results, that the cell of origin of MCCs is a pro/pre- or pre-B cell rather than the postmitotic Merkel cells. MCPyV infection and transformation of pro-/pre-B cells are likely to induce the expression of simple cytokeratins as has been shown for SV40 in other nonepithelial cells. This model of cellular ancestry of MCCs might impact therapy and possibly helps to understand why approximately 20% of MCCs are MCPyV-negative.",

It has a predilection for the aorta and its major branches, including the carotid and vertebral arteries. Ophthalmic artery involvement frequently leads to irreversible visual loss, and therefore GCA is one of the few true ophthalmic emergencies. GCA, although classified as a large vessel vasculitis, is known to affect smaller-sized vessels, resulting in a multiplicity of signs in the eye, some of which are often missed.<h4>Purpose</h4>We set out to highlight some of the less frequently observed clinical signs, which may provide clues to clinically diagnosing GCA in patients presenting with non-classical features and inconclusive inflammatory markers.<h4>Methods</h4>We review the literature and describe the diverse ocular features and some of the systemic findings that can be associated with GCA.<h4>Results</h4>Although the most common ocular manifestation of GCA is anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, the clinical presentation of GCA can vary dramatically. In the absence of obvious ocular involvement, more subtle ophthalmic signs of anterior segment ischaemia, such as hypotony and anisocoria, may be present at the time of initial clinical examination.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There are no specific biomarkers for disease to date; therefore, pertinent history and clinical examination can guide towards diagnosis in the acute setting.

The median time to development of t-MDS/AML is 3-5 years, with the risk decreasing markedly after the first decade. t-MDS/AML is the major cause of non-relapse mortality after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for HL or NHL. The magnitude of risk of t-MDS/AML is higher, and the latency is shorter after HCT, compared to conventional therapy. Two types of t-MDS/AML are recognized depending on the causative therapeutic exposure: an alkylating agent/radiation-related type and a topoisomerase II inhibitor-related type. Inter-individual variability in the risk for development of t-MDS/AML suggests a role for genetic variation in susceptibility to genotoxic exposures. Treatment of t-MDS/AML with conventional therapy is associated with a uniformly poor prognosis, with a median survival of 6 months. Because of the poor response to conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic HCT is recommended. Current research is focused on developing risk prediction and risk reduction strategies.",

Much of the management for UCS has been extrapolated from studies of endometrial carcinomas and sarcomas. This article critically reviews the literature pertinent to the pathology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of women with UCS.<h4>Methods</h4>MEDLINE was searched for English language literature on UCS with a focus on the past 20years. Given the rarity of this tumor, studies were not limited by design or number of reported patients.<h4>Results</h4>UCS is biologically a de-differentiated endometrial carcinoma with its own pathogenesis and molecular profile. It commonly presents with extrauterine disease which can be identified by comprehensive surgical staging. Most UCS patients are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy. The role of radiation is less clear. Combination therapy, while commonly used, has not been studied in depth. The high recurrence rate and poor overall survival for UCS suggest an ongoing need for clinical trials for UCS specifically.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UCS represents a distinct subtype of uterine malignancy, and should be studied as such via focused clinical trials.",

Levels of inflammatory markers such as white blood cells and C-reactive protein are elevated, as well as levels of lactate dehydrogenase, IL-18, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. The exact pathogenesis of fulminant MPP remains unclear, but theories include a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to M. pneumoniae and the contribution of delayed antibiotic administration to disease progression. Treatment options involve pairing the appropriate anti-mycoplasma agent with a corticosteroid that will downregulate the hypersensitivity response, and mortality rates are quite low in this treatment group. Further research is necessary to determine the exact pathogenesis of severe and fulminant types of MPP.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00800/pdf

Twenty sides were studied in 10 cadaveric specimens that had been previously injected with latex. The rami of the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve and branches of the STA were dissected out through pterional and orbitozygomatic approaches by using a submuscular or subfascial temporal muscle dissection technique. The three rami of the temporal branch of the facial nerve (the auricularis, frontalis, and orbicularis) were found to run within the galeal plane of the scalp. The zygomatic branch of the facial nerve was found to course deeper than the most caudal extension of the galea, known as the superficial musculoaponeurotic layer. The frontal branch of the STA served as an important landmark for the subfascial or submuscular dissections because excessive reflection of the scalp flap inferior to the level of this vessel would inadvertently injure the frontalis branch of the facial nerve. Subfascial and submuscular dissections of the temporal muscle offer an alternative to the interfascial technique during anterolateral craniotomies. Scalp and temporal dissection performed with careful attention to anatomical landmarks (frontal branch of the STA and the suprafascial fat pad) provides a safe and expeditious alternative to the traditional interfascial technique.",

Yet, transseptal puncture (TSP) remains a challenging step that necessitates accurate guidance. We describe our experience performing TSP under electroanatomic (EA) guidance.<h4>Methods and results</h4>The analysis included 145 consecutive EA-guided ablation procedures performed between June 2018 and April 2019 and 145 consecutive standard ablations performed before June 2018. EA guidance utilized the CARTO 3 three-dimensional mapping system to reconstruct anatomic and electrical characteristics of the right atrium and fossa ovalis. Patients with a history of previous cardiac surgery were excluded. For EA-guided procedures, the mean patient age was 60 ± 10 years, 75.2% were male, and 69.0% had paroxysmal AF. Similarly, the mean age for conventional procedures was 60 ± 11 years, 71.0% were male, and 71.7% had paroxysmal AF. The fossa ovalis was detected as a region of low voltage, <0.75 mV. EA guidance yielded shorter fluoroscopy times (EA vs. conventional, 3.6 ± 2.5 vs. 13.5 ± 10.5 min; p < .001) and a lower dose area product than conventional guidance (13 ± 11 Gy* cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 28 ± 27  Gy* cm<sup>2</sup> ; p < .001). The total procedure duration was similar between groups (146 ± 48 vs. 148 ± 54 min). There were no significant complications related to TSP.<h4>Conclusion</h4>During AF ablation, TSP with EA guidance facilitated safe access to the left atrium while reducing radiation risk to both patients and operators.",

Patients could present with signs and symptoms deriving from the involvement of structures within the orbital apex, the superior orbital fissure or the cavernous sinus. The primary focus of the ophthalmologist should be to locate the lesion and then identify its etiology. Clinical evaluation holds key to diagnosis which is aided then by certain serological and lab investigations and neuro-imaging modalities including brain and orbital MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) with contrast, CT (Computed Tomography) scans. In rare instances, a biopsy may be needed to aid in diagnosis. Treatment depends on what the nature of the lesion is with inflammatory conditions usually responding to steroids and infections to anti-microbial agents. Through this review, the authors attempt to decode the approach to localizing the lesion, the etiopathology and the management of cases of orbital apex syndrome.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=54661

All patients had the Carney complex (myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation, endocrine overactivity, and schwannomas); six patients were members of three families. The nevi occurred on the extremities and trunk, less frequently on the head and neck, and were multiple in five patients. Clinically, they were darkly pigmented, domed, and small (less than 1 cm) and commonly interpreted as ""blue nevi."" Microscopically, they featured heavily pigmented, poorly circumscribed, dermal lesions that displayed two types of melanocytes: one intensely pigmented, globular, and fusiform; the other lightly pigmented, polygonal, and spindle. The melanocytes were situated among the dermal collagen bundles singly, in short rows and small groups, and occasionally in fascicles. Nuclei of the lightly pigmented, polygonal and spindle cells were vesicular with very pale chromatin and a single prominent nucleolus. Seven tumors were each part of a combined nevus. After excision, none of the tumors recurred or metastasized. The epithelioid blue nevus is important because of its strong association with the Carney complex.

Causes of acute liver failure include paracetamol toxicity, hepatic ischaemia, viral and autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury from prescription drugs, and herbal and dietary supplements. Diagnosis requires careful review of medications taken, and serological testing for possible viral exposure. Because of its rarity, acute liver failure has not been studied in large, randomised trials, and most treatment recommendations represent expert opinion.

The purpose of this study is to re-evaluate whether the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) amongst women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is higher than in the general population using the NIH criteria. Methods. We included all consecutive women with IIH of child-bearing age seen at a hospital-based neuro-ophthalmology clinic between the years 2000-2005. All consenting women included in this study filled-out a screening questionnaire aimed at identifying women at risk for PCOS. The endocrinologist examined each patient suspect of PCOS as well as their biochemical results and diagnosed PCOS according to NIH criteria. The prevalence of PCOS in these women with IIH was compared with the reported prevalence of PCOS in the general population. Results. Out of 58 women with IIH who completed the study, definite PCOS was diagnosed in nine women (9/58; 15.5%).

Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in dogs requires testing to distinguish it from other canine coronaviruses. In the last year, significant advances have been made in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, allowing its surveillance in both human and animal populations. Here, using ELISA and automated western blotting (AWB) assays, we performed a longitudinal study on 809 apparently healthy dogs from different regions of France to investigate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were three main groups: (i) 356 dogs sampled once before the pandemic, (ii) 235 dogs sampled once during the pandemic, and (iii) 218 dogs, including 82 dogs sampled twice (before and during the pandemic), 125 dogs sampled twice during the pandemic and 11 dogs sampled three times (once before and twice during the pandemic). Using ELISA, seroprevalence was significantly higher during the pandemic [5.5% (25/453)] than during the pre-pandemic period [1.1% (5/449)]. Among the 218 dogs sampled twice, at least 8 ELISA-seroconversions were observed. ELISA positive pre-pandemic sera were not confirmed in serial tests by AWB, indicating possible ELISA cross-reactivity, probably with other canine coronaviruses. A significant difference was observed between these two serological tests (Q = 88, <i>p</i> = 0.008). A clear correlation was observed between SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in dogs and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human population from the same area. AWB could be used as a second line assay to confirm the doubtful and discrepant ELISA results in dogs. Our results confirm the previous experimental models regarding the susceptibility of dogs to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that viral transmission from and between dogs is weak or absent. However, the new variants with multiple mutations could adapt to dogs; this hypothesis cannot be ruled out in the absence of genomic data on SARS-CoV-2 from dogs.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8327341?pdf=render

Knowledge regarding responsible drugs, mechanisms, risk factors, and the diagnostic tools to detect liver injury have continued to grow in the past year. This review highlights what we considered the most significant publications from among more than 1800 articles relating to liver injury from medications, herbal products, and dietary supplements in 2017 and 2018. The US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) prospective study highlighted several areas of ongoing study, including the potential utility of human leukocyte antigens and microRNAs as DILI risk factors and new data on racial differences, the role of alcohol consumption, factors associated with prognosis, and updates on the clinical signatures of autoimmune DILI, thiopurines, and HDS agents. Novel data were also generated from the Spanish and Latin American DILI registries as well as from Chinese and Korean case series. A few new agents causing DILI were added to the growing list in the past 2 years, including sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, as were new aspects of chemotherapy-associated liver injury. A number of cases reported previously described hepatotoxins confirmed via the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM; e.g., norethisterone, methylprednisolone, glatiramer acetate) and/or the DILIN method (e.g., celecoxib, dimethyl fumarate). Additionally, much work centered on elucidating the pathophysiology of DILI, including the importance of bile salt export pumps and immune-mediated mechanisms. Finally, it must be noted that, while hundreds of new studies described DILI in 2017-2018, the quality of such reports must always be addressed. Björnsson reminds us to remain very critical of the data when addressing the future utility of a study, which is why it is so important to adhere to a standardized method such as RUCAM when determining DILI causality. While drug-induced hepatotoxicity remains a diagnosis of exclusion, the diverse array of publications that appeared in 2017 and 2018 provided important advances in our understanding of DILI, paving the way for our improved ability to make a more definitive diagnosis and risk assessment.",

Identification of underlying antibodies against neuronal ion channels or receptors led to the speculation that a number of patients go misdiagnosed with a primary psychiatric disease. However, there is no clear consensus which clinical signs in psychiatric patients should prompt further investigations including measurement of anti-neuronal autoantibodies. We therefore aimed to analyze the presenting symptoms in patients with autoimmune encephalitis and the time between symptom onset and initiation of antibody diagnostics. For this, we recruited 100 patients from the Charité Center for Autoimmune Encephalitis between May and October 2016, including all types of autoimmune encephalitides. Psychiatric abnormalities were the most common clinical symptoms and were the presenting sign in 60%. One-third of patients were initially hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. All patients positive for antibodies against the <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor showed behavioral changes, hallucinations, memory deficits, catatonia, or delusions. Patients positive for antibodies against other cell surface or intracellular antigens were often hospitalized with a psychosomatic diagnosis. The time between occurrence of first symptoms and antibody testing was often alarmingly prolonged. In patients with symptom onset between 2013 and 2016, the mean delay was 74 days, in cases diagnosed between 2007 and 2012 even 483 days, suggesting though that increased awareness of this novel disease group helped to expedite proper diagnosis and treatment. By analyzing the medical records in detail, we identified clinical signs that may help to assist in earlier diagnosis, including seizures, catatonia, autonomic instability, or hyperkinesia. Indeed, reanalyzing the whole cohort using these ""red flags"" led to a 58% reduction of time between symptom onset and diagnosis. We conclude that the timely diagnosis of an autoimmune psychiatric disease can be facilitated by use of the described clinical warning signs, likely enabling earlier immunotherapy and better prognosis. Also, the threshold for cerebrospinal fluid analysis and autoantibody testing should be low.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00025/pdf

It has been reported in Europe and Japan, but no Australian series have been published. We describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic features of a group of patients with the SAPHO syndrome and compare this with the literature.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a retrospective review of patients seen in our department between 1990 and 1998 who met the proposed diagnostic criteria for SAPHO. Information regarding age, sex, disease duration, skeletal site(s) of disease, presence of skin disease, previous treatment, and response to treatment was collected. Laboratory tests were reviewed, as was all available radiology and bone scintigraphy.<h4>Results</h4>Six women with a mean age of 40 years fulfilled the criteria for SAPHO. The skeletal manifestations were similar to those reported in the literature, with hyperostosis of the anterior chest wall being the central feature. Cervical spine and pubic bone were other sites of involvement, whereas sacroiliitis and peripheral joint synovitis were not seen. Skin disease was less frequent in our population than has been reported in other series. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were frequently prescribed as first-line treatment but had limited efficacy. Intravenous pamidronate was administered to two patients, resulting in complete resolution of pain in one patient and 50% reduction in pain in the other.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SAPHO syndrome may be underrecognized as the skin manifestations in our patients were mild or absent. Although optimal treatment for these patients remains unclear, it is important to make the diagnosis of SAPHO to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatment.",

This 1-year cross-sectional study was aimed at documenting the prevalence of BRD-related pathogens and clinical signs before and after a long journey and at identifying possible predisposition factors. Male Limousine beef steers (<i>n</i> = 169) traveling from France to Italy were health checked and sampled with Deep Nasopharyngeal Swabs (DNS) at loading (T0) and 4 days after arrival (T1). Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify the presence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), <i>Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis</i>, and <i>Pasteurella multocida</i>. Weather conditions at departure and arrival were recorded, and the travel conditions were taken from the travel documentation. At T0, even if no animals displayed clinical signs, some of them were already positive for one or more pathogens. At T1, the number of animals displaying clinical signs and positive for BCoV, BAdV, BRSV, <i>H. somni, M. haemolytica, M. bovis</i>, and <i>P. multocida</i> increased dramatically (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Transport also significantly increased co-infection passing from 16.0% at T0 to 82.8% at T1 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). An extra stop during the journey seemed to favor BRSV, <i>M. haemolytica</i>, and <i>P. multocida</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Weather conditions, in particular sudden climate changes from departure to arrival and daily temperature variance, were found to be predisposing factors for many of the pathogens. The farm of arrival also played a role for BRSV, BAdV, and <i>H. somni</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). BCoV increased dramatically, but no associations were found confirming that it spreads easily during transport phases. Our findings increased our understanding of factors increasing the likelihood of BRD-related pathogens shedding and can be useful to minimize the incidence of BRD and to implement animal transport regulations.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.627894/pdf

Among autoimmune diseases, it is a relatively common disease, but the burden of central nervous system (CNS) involvement is controversial. This retrospective study evaluates the prevalence, clinical patterns and outcomes of CNS involvement in a cohort of patients with primary Sjögren syndrome. We evaluated 93 patients with pSS diagnosed according to American-European Consensus Group criteria. Fourteen patients (15.1 %) had CNS involvement. All were women with an average age of onset of the disease of 42.1 ± 14.7 years (average ± SD) and an average age of onset of neurological involvement of 47.29 ± 16 years. Three had parkinsonian syndrome, two epilepsy, two motor and sensory deficits, two headache with brain magnetic resonance abnormalities, two neuromyelitis optica, two chronic progressive myelitis and one aseptic meningitis. Neurological involvement preceded Sjögren syndrome diagnosis in nine of the patients (64 %), and neurological outcome was good in 11 patients (78.6 %). Central nervous involvement was not as rare as expected, and the frequency was similar to the frequency of peripheral nervous system involvement. In half of the patients, this was the first symptom of the disease, emphasizing the importance of considering this diagnosis, especially in young female with neurological symptoms without other evident cause.",

Six strains (Enterobacter cloacae 2 strains, Citrobacter freundii 1 strain, Serratia marcescens 2 strain, and Morganella morganii 1 strain) possessing chromosomal inducible AmpC β-lactamase were used as controls. Four strains (Escherichia coli 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 strain, and C. koseri 1 strain) possessing DHA-1 β-lactamase were used. The β-lactamase activities were determined by a spectrophotometer using nitrocefin. β-lactamase induction by PIP, PIP/TZB was not observed in any strains and β-lactamase induction by third- and fourth-generation cephems was not observed in most strains. The induction ratios of the chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase in the reference group by PIP/TZB were <1.51, and those of the DHA-1 β-lactamase were <1.36, except for K. pneumoniae Rkp2004 (2.22).

British volume,"The incidence and long-term outcome of undisplaced fatigue fractures of the femoral neck treated conservatively were examined in Finnish military conscripts between 1970 and 1990. From 106 cases identified, 66 patients with 70 fractures were followed for a mean of 18.3 years (11 to 32). The original medical records and radiographs were studied and physical and radiological follow-up data analysed for evidence of risk factors for this injury. The development of avascular necrosis and osteoarthritis was determined from the follow-up radiographs and MR scans. The impact of new military instructions on the management of hip-related pain was assessed following their introduction in 1986. The preventive regimen (1986) improved awareness and increased the detected incidence from 13.2 per 100,000 service-years (1970 to 1986) to 53.2 per 100,000 (1987 to 1990). No patient developed displacement of the fracture or avascular necrosis of the femoral head, or suffered from adverse complications. No differences were found in MRI-measured hip joint spaces at final follow-up. The mean Harris Hip Score was 97 (70 to 100) and the Visual Analogue Scale 5.85 mm (0 to 44). Non-operative treatment, including avoidance of or reduced weight-bearing, gave favourable short- and long-term outcomes.

To improve their identification, we compared dimensional and neuropsychological profile of bipolar patients with or without history of suicide attempt, taking into account suicidal severity (i.e. admission to intensive ward).<h4>Method</h4>A total of 343 adult euthymic bipolar out-patients recruited in the French FondaMental Advanced Centres of Expertise for Bipolar Disorder were divided into three subgroups: 214 patients without history of suicide attempt, 88 patients with past history of non-severe suicide attempt and 41 patients with past history of severe suicide attempt. General intellectual functioning, speed of information processing, verbal learning and memory, verbal fluency and executive functioning were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Severe suicide attempters had lower affective intensity and lability than non-severe attempters. Severe suicide attempters outperformed non-severe attempters for verbal learning and non-attempters for Stroop word reading part after adjustment for study centre, age, gender, educational level, antipsychotics use, depression score, anxious and addictive comorbidities.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neuropsychological tasks commonly used to assess bipolar patients do not seem accurate to identify suicide attempters in euthymic patients. In the future, decision-making and emotional recognition tasks should be assessed. Moreover, clinical and neuropsychological profiles should be considered together to better define suicidal risk.",

The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response. COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. The clinical findings include changes in electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function. When cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not feasible, cardiac computed tomographic angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns. Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.

Therefore, this study aimed to describe the occurrence of transient deep/giant NTWs in dogs with MI.<h4>Animals, materials and methods</h4>Medical records were retrospectively searched to identify dogs with MI and transient deep/giant NTWs. Signalment, history, and selected diagnostic test results were reviewed. Data analysis was descriptive.<h4>Results</h4>Six cases were diagnosed with MI associated with deep (n = 1) and giant (n = 5) transient NTWs. Myocardial injury was classified as acute in all cases and was due to snake envenomation (n = 3), sepsis (n = 2), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (n = 1). At the time of deep/giant NTWs identification, all dogs had elevated cardiac troponin I and ≥1 echocardiographic abnormality of the left ventricular structure and/or function. Moreover, all dogs with giant NTWs had prolonged QT intervals. After the MI resolution, T-wave polarity and QT-interval duration became normalized in all dogs. Moreover, left ventricular morphological and functional parameters were completely normalized in four dogs. In contrast, ventricular echogenicity remained heterogeneous in two dogs, despite otherwise normalized ventricular parameters. Five dogs were still alive at the conclusion of the study.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Transient deep/giant NTWs may develop in dogs with acute MI and T-wave polarity changes seem to occur synchronously with the evolution of myocardial damage.

The present review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the clinicopathological characteristics, therapeutic strategies and outcomes for metastatic tumors in the stomach. The primary malignancies of the metastatic tumors in the stomach were most often breast cancers (27.9 %), followed by lung cancer (23.8 %), esophageal cancer (19.1 %), renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 7.6 %) and malignant melanoma (7.0 %). In cases of breast cancer and RCC as the primary malignancy, the median interval between the treatment of the primary tumor and diagnosis of the metastatic tumor in the stomach (IPM) was 50-78 and 75.6 months, respectively, highlighting the fact that the metastatic spread to the stomach may occur many years after the initial treatment of the cancer. In nine patients with metastatic gastric tumors arising from ovarian cancer, an endoscopic examination revealed submucosal tumors in six patients (66.7 %), with a median IPM of 30 months. Appropriate systemic treatment for these tumors is the preferred therapeutic strategy.

Treatment options include observation, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgical resection. Historically, retrocochlear pathology was a contraindication to cochlear implantation (CI). However it is now recognized as viable, in an attempt to restore hearing and improve communication.Thus, the aim of this study was to contrast auditory function in CI recipients with NF2 whose tumors were either observed versus initially treated with SRS.<h4>Methods</h4>A local review of hearing outcomes in 2 CI patients (3 ears total) with NF2 was undertaken and then pooled with the existing medical literature. Comparative post-implant outcome data, including pure-tone average and aided speech perception measurements was analyzed and compared between 8 subjects whose tumors were observed and 11 subjects who received pre-implantation SRS.<h4>Results</h4>Mean tumor size in the observation cohort was 0.81cm (.13cm to 1.50cm), and 2.34cm in the SRS group (0.10cm to 3.7cm). The mean reported duration of deafness was 22 months as compared to 71 months in the SRS cohort. Both groups demonstrated similar pre-implant candidacy criteria, average age and open-set speech recognition. Although disparate outcome measurements were utilized across studies, an analysis of post-implant open-set speech perception found no significant differences between groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite a small sample size and highly variable post implantation testing methods, patients who undergo SRS for NF2 associated Schwannoma prior to CI have similar hearing performance and benefit by having already completed definitive tumor management.",

Sex distribution is nearly equal. Lipomas occur most frequently in the lower limb (71% overall), particularly in the os calcis (32%). Other common sites include the metaphyses of long bones, where lesions are typically eccentric. Lipomas are usually well defined, but marginal sclerosis is commoner in lesions of the os calcis (61%) than at other sites (38%). Calcification is also more frequent in the os calcis (62%), and almost invariably centrally located. Calcification at other sites is less common (30%), and is more variable in appearance. Bone expansion is less common (30%), and usually minimal. Fat necrosis and cyst formation identified on MRI is common (67%), and more frequent in the os calcis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although there is correlation between the histological and radiological features of intraosseous lipomas in general, some discrepancies occur in the radiological appearances of lipomas in different sites. The evidence that these lesions are true benign tumours of fat is controversial. Several aetiological factors have been implicated in their development. The constant location of os calcis lesions at the critical angle suggests an aetiology that may be related to biomechanical lines of stress. In other instances it is possible that involution of pre-existing lesions may lead to the development of lipomas.",

The carcinosarcoma was in the head of pancreas. She underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy. The tumor was grossly yellowish-whitish. Histologic evaluation of the tumor revealed 2 elements separated from each other. One component was conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and the other component showed sarcomatous growth pattern composed of pleomorphic spindle cells. Immunohistochemically, the adenocarcinoma component was reactive for antibodies to cytokeratin 18 and epithelial membrane antigen. The sarcomatous component was reactive for smooth muscle antibody. These findings led to a diagnosis of pancreatic carcinosarcoma. The patient was treated with gemcitabine, adriamycin, and cisplatin after the operation. Although previously reported patients with pancreatic carcinosarcoma showed a very poor outcome, this patient has remained free of recurrence for 20 months, which is the longest recurrence-free survival time recorded for this type of cancer. This treatment plan may be a feasible option.",

However, only few studies exist regarding this subject. We conducted a mini-review on the possible associations between neurologic language impairment (on the motor, comprehension, and semantic sides) and SI/SB. Based on the literature review, we hypothesized that language impairments exacerbate psychiatric comorbidities, which, in turn, aggravate language impairments. Patients trapped in this vicious cycle can develop SI/SB. The so-called ""affective prosody"" provides some relevant insights concerning the interaction between the different language levels and the world of emotions. This hypothesis is illustrated in a clinical presentation, consisting of the case of a 74-year old woman who was admitted to a psychiatric emergency department (ED) after a failed SA. Having suffered an ischemic stroke two years earlier, she suffered from incomplete Broca's aphasia and dysprosody. She also presented with generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms. We observed that her language impairments were both aggravated by the exacerbations of her anxiety and depressive symptoms. In this patient, who had deficits on the motor side, these exacerbations were triggered by her inability to express herself, her emotional status, and suffering. SI was fluctuant, and-one year after the SA-she completed suicide. Further studies are needed to ascertain possible reciprocal and interacting associations between language impairments, psychiatric comorbidities, and SI/SB. They could enable clinicians to better understand their patient's specific suffering, as brought on by language impairment, and contribute to the refining of suicide risk detection in this sub-group of affected patients.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/12/1594/pdf?version=1638959751

The original Physical Function ICU Test (PFIT) demonstrates reliability and sensitivity.<h4>Objective</h4>The aims of this study were to further develop the original PFIT, to derive an interval score (the PFIT-s), and to test the clinimetric properties of the PFIT-s.<h4>Design</h4>A nested cohort study was conducted.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred forty-four and 116 participants performed the PFIT at ICU admission and discharge, respectively. Original test components were modified using principal component analysis. Rasch analysis examined the unidimensionality of the PFIT, and an interval score was derived. Correlations tested validity, and multiple regression analyses investigated predictive ability. Responsiveness was assessed using the effect size index (ESI), and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was calculated.<h4>Results</h4>The shoulder lift component was removed. Unidimensionality of combined admission and discharge PFIT-s scores was confirmed. The PFIT-s displayed moderate convergent validity with the Timed ""Up & Go"" Test (r=-.60), the Six-Minute Walk Test (r=.41), and the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (rho=.49). The ESI of the PFIT-s was 0.82, and the MCID was 1.5 points (interval scale range=0-10). A higher admission PFIT-s score was predictive of: an MRC score of ≥48, increased likelihood of discharge home, reduced likelihood of discharge to inpatient rehabilitation, and reduced acute care hospital length of stay.<h4>Limitations</h4>Scoring of sit-to-stand assistance required is subjective, and cadence cutpoints used may not be generalizable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PFIT-s is a safe and inexpensive test of physical function with high clinical utility. It is valid, responsive to change, and predictive of key outcomes. It is recommended that the PFIT-s be adopted to test physical function in the ICU.",

Although many genes are expressed similarly in the two systems, there are important differences in the kinetics of induction of some genes. These differences allowed us to identify and characterize novel genes that are highly insulin-induced and expressed as delayed-early genes in regenerating liver. Sequence analysis of CL-6, the most abundant insulin-induced gene, resulted in the identification of a highly hydrophobic hepatic protein. Sequence analysis of HRS, a highly insulin-induced delayed-early gene, demonstrated that it is a member of the family of regulators of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Different forms of HRS mRNA are temporally regulated during the growth response, suggesting that HRS could autoregulate processing of its pre-mRNA. Given the dramatic increase in RNA production during late G1, proteins induced by mitogens like insulin that control RNA processing are likely to have important roles in cell cycle regulation.",

Despite the importance of bipolar depression, there are only a small number of recognised treatment options available. Consecutive treatment failures can quickly exhaust these options leading to treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBD). Remarkably few studies have evaluated TRBD and those available lack a comprehensive definition of multi-therapy-resistant bipolar depression (MTRBD).AimsTo reach consensus regarding threshold definitions criteria for TRBD and MTRBD.<h4>Method</h4>Based on the evidence of standard treatments available in the latest bipolar disorder treatment guidelines, TRBD and MTRBD criteria were agreed by a representative panel of bipolar disorder experts using a modified Delphi method.<h4>Results</h4>TRBD criteria in bipolar depression was defined as failure to reach sustained symptomatic remission for 8 consecutive weeks after two different treatment trials, at adequate therapeutic doses, with at least two recommended monotherapy treatments or at least one monotherapy treatment and another combination treatment. MTRBD included the same initial definition as TRBD, with the addition of failure of at least one trial with an antidepressant, a psychological treatment and a course of electroconvulsive therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed TRBD and MTRBD criteria may provide an important signpost to help clinicians, researchers and stakeholders in judging how and when to consider new non-standard treatments. However, some challenging diagnostic and therapeutic issues were identified in the consensus process that need further evaluation and research.Declaration of interestIn the past 3 years, M.B. has received grant/research support from the NIH, Cooperative Research Centre, Simons Autism Foundation, Cancer Council of Victoria, Stanley Medical Research Foundation, MBF, NHMRC, Beyond Blue, Rotary Health, Geelong Medical Research Foundation, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Glaxo SmithKline, Meat and Livestock Board, Organon, Novartis, Mayne Pharma, Servier, Woolworths, Avant and the Harry Windsor Foundation, has been a speaker for Astra Zeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Glaxo SmithKline, Janssen Cilag, Lundbeck, Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi Synthelabo, Servier, Solvay and Wyeth and served as a consultant to Allergan, Astra Zeneca, Bioadvantex, Bionomics, Collaborative Medicinal Development, Eli Lilly, Grunbiotics, Glaxo SmithKline, Janssen Cilag, LivaNova, Lundbeck, Merck, Mylan, Otsuka, Pfizer and Servier.

Series B,"Six calves, aged 24 to 58 days and not previously exposed to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), were infected with this agent by nose-to-nose contact with a persistently BVDV viraemic calf. The study was conducted in two trials, using 3 calves in each. All 6 calves showed a peak interferon level in serum at 4 days post infection (dpi), and they seroconverted to BVDV at 16-21 dpi. The calves in trial 1 had diarrhoea for 2 or 3 days between 2 and 6 dpi and one calf again from 9 to 11 dpi. During the periods of fever, the calves were slightly depressed. Those in trial 2 were more depressed and their oral and nasal mucous membranes were reddened but they never had diarrhoea. In both trials, fever (up to 41.3 degrees C) was a prominent symptom at 8 to 9 dpi and 2 calves showed a diphasic fever course. Respiratory affection was mild and no medical treatment was required. Haematological assessment demonstrated a transient but significant leukopenia and lymphopenia at 4 dpi (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05 respectively) and 11 dpi (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 respectively). A significant decrease in thrombocyte count was seen at 4 dpi (P less than 0.05, n = 3). This study has demonstrated that nose-to-nose contact is an effective way of transmitting BVDV from persistently infected to susceptible cattle.",

However, previous studies in healthy young men failed to report FSH escape during GnRH agonist treatment for up to 16 weeks. We considered the possibility that this may have been due to the insensitivity of the FSH assays. Accordingly, using highly sensitive and specific two-site directed fluorometric assays and a sustained-release GnRH agonist formulation, we reexamined the issue of whether serum FSH levels rise after initial suppression during chronic GnRH agonist treatment. Two groups of healthy normal men, 19-50 years of age, received 7.5 mg of a long-acting GnRH agonist microcapsule formulation (Lupron Depot; TAP Pharmaceutical Company, North Chicago, Illinois) on days 1 and 30. In addition, the subjects received either 4 or 8 mg/day testosterone replacement by means of a testosterone microcapsule injected intramuscularly on day 1. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH levels were measured by sensitive and specific two-site directed fluorometric assays on multiple occasions during the 3-week control period and the 9-week treatment period. Serum LH levels declined to a nadir between 2 and 4 weeks and stayed suppressed throughout the remainder of the treatment period in both the 4- and 8-mg testosterone groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The patient had a significant increasing abdominal pain and intense reflex sensitivity in the right shoulder when she presented to our hospital. Laparoscopic surgery was decided immediately with the impression of ruptured abdominal pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock. It was found that ectopic pregnancy was implanted on the diaphragmatic surface.The pregnant tissue was completely resected from the diaphragm and bipolar electrocoagulation was used to control bleeding. The patient was stable and discharged 3 days after surgery in a good condition.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CT or MRI should be considered as an alternative to TVS in the management of ectopic pregnancy patients with unusual presentations.

Muscle biopsies showed minimal change myopathy, no neurogenic atrophy but remarkable type-1 fibre predominance (up to 85.5%) without fibre-type disproportion. Clinical examination at 12 and 9 years, respectively, showed mild facial weakness and high-arched palate in both patients. The younger sibling also had ptosis but otherwise normal external ocular muscles. They showed symmetric proximal muscle weakness and wasting associated with calf-muscle hypertrophy. They could walk independently. A repeat muscle biopsy showed advanced dystrophic changes in the younger patient at the age of 10 years. Virtually all the remaining fibres were type 1. Immunohistochemistry revealed normal expression of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), including dystrophin, beta-dystroglycan, alpha-(adhalin), beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan, laminin-alpha2 chain (merosin) and syntrophin. Mild dystrophic features and type-1 fibre predominance (92.5%) were seen in the biopsy of the older patient, whereas immunohistochemistry showed normal expression of the DGC.

Infectious diseases,"<h4>Background</h4>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.<h4>Methods</h4>We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL (IQR 4·1-7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0·15, 95% CI -0·19 to -0·11; R<sup>2</sup>=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074-0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R<sup>2</sup>>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.<h4>Funding</h4>Richard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy Service, and Sanming Project of Medicine.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7158907?pdf=render

Regardless of clinical severity, LCH lesions share the common histology of CD1a(+)/CD207(+) dendritic cells with characteristic morphology among an inflammatory infiltrate. Despite historical uncertainty defining LCH as inflammatory vs neoplastic and incomplete understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis, clinical outcomes have improved markedly over the past decades through cooperative randomized clinical trials based on empiric therapeutic strategies. Significant advances include recognition of high- and low-risk clinical groups defined by hematopoietic and/or hepatic involvement, and of the importance of optimal intensity and of duration of chemotherapy. Nevertheless, mortality of high-risk patients, disease recurrence, lack of robustly tested salvage strategies, and significant disease morbidity of both high- and low-risk patients remain challenges. Recent discovery of recurrent somatic mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway genes at critical stages of myeloid hematopoietic differentiation in LCH patients supports redefinition of the disease as a myeloproliferative disorder and provides opportunities to develop novel approaches to diagnosis and therapy.",

Studies on the mechanisms of action have revealed that endogenous opioid peptides in the central nervous system play an essential role in mediating the analgesic effect of EA. Further studies have shown that different kinds of neuropeptides are released by EA with different frequencies. For example, EA of 2 Hz accelerates the release of enkephalin, beta-endorphin and endomorphin, while that of 100 Hz selectively increases the release of dynorphin. A combination of the two frequencies produces a simultaneous release of all four opioid peptides, resulting in a maximal therapeutic effect.

The retinal vascular complex comprises a number of cell types, in addition to vascular endothelial cells, including pericytes, microglia, astrocytes-none of which is intrinsic to the retina. In addition, amacrine-like cells make bouton-like associations with retinal vessels and may be involved in the autoregulation of blood flow. During development endothelial cells 'invade' the retina, accompanied by a population of microglial cells; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes are also seen associated with the developing vasculature, and are in advance of the vascular front by a few hundred microns. Recent findings indicate that astrocytes at the vascular front proliferate in response to factors released by endothelial cells, including leukemia inhibitory factor. Better understood is the role of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes just in advance of the developing vessels. These astrocytes are sensitive to hypoxia and in response release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which in turn promotes the migration, differentiation and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. This hypoxia/VEGF-mediated process of migration, proliferation and differentiation appears common to the retinae of a variety of species, including human. However, in human and macaque retina, different mechanisms appear to govern the development of the retinal vessels growing along the horizontal meridian of the retina towards the central area, which contains the fovea. Despite the relatively advanced state of differentiation and maturation of cells in the central area compared with the periphery, the growth of retinal vessels into the central area has been described as 'retarded', and the incidence of cell proliferation associated with these vessels is lower than in peripheral vessels. Furthermore, neither retinal vessels nor their accompanying astrocytes grow into a circumscribed region which, at a later stage, develops into the foveal depression. These observations suggest that molecular markers define the foveal region and inhibit cell proliferation and vascular growth at the fovea and, perhaps, along the horizontal meridian. The findings also suggest that at the fovea, the retina is adapted morphologically to its blood supply, since in the vicinity of the fovea, the development of retinal vessels is retarded or inhibited. The limitations on vascularization of central retina has implications for its vulnerability to degenerative changes, as seen in age-related macular degeneration.",

Lipomas usually undergo varying degrees of involution, with necrosis, cyst formation, and calcification. Careful radiological-pathological correlation is required to avoid misinterpretation. This study describes 12 intraosseous lipomas in 11 patients (6 men, 5 women; mean age, 36 years [range, 25-50 years]; mean follow-up, 5 years [range, 2-11 years]). The lesions were located in the calcaneus in 7 patients (bilaterally in 1 patient), the tibia in 2, the femur in 1, and the ilium in 1. All lesions were asymptomatic and discovered incidentally except in 4 patients (5 lesions). Curettage and bone grafting were performed after biopsy in 4 lesions; and in 1 patient, curettage, bone grafting, and reconstructive surgery were performed after pathologic fracture. The remaining 7 patients were followed up conservatively. Although definite diagnosis of an intraosseous lesion is possible only by histopathologic examination, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of intraosseous lipoma are typical, and most patients' symptoms are relieved by conservative means. For this reason, we believe that in patients with no signs of an impending pathologic fracture or suspicion of malignancy, clinical and radiological follow-up is sufficient. However, since intraosseous lipoma is an uncommon bone tumor, physicians should be familiar with the radiological features of this lesion for the correct diagnosis.",

In this study, we examined patient characteristics and prognostic factors for survival after a diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Three hundred eighteen consecutive patients with breast cancer diagnosed with leptomeningeal metastasis from January 1998 to December 2013 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were identified. Clinicopathologic and treatment information were obtained in a retrospective review. Associations with time from leptomeningeal diagnosis to death were evaluated according to Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard models.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 318 patients, 44% were hormone receptor-positive (HR+) HER2<sup>-</sup>, 18% were HR<sup>+</sup>HER2<sup>+</sup>, 8.5% were HR<sup>-</sup>HER2<sup>+</sup>, 25.5% were triple-negative; and 4% had missing information. The median survival was 3.5 months (95% confidence interval, 3.0-4.0) with 63 patients (20%) surviving >1 year. Recent diagnosis (after 2006), HER2<sup>+</sup> subtype, higher performance status, cranial-only involvement, and no evidence of noncentral nervous system disease were independently associated with improved survival in multivariate analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite the improvement noted with the more recent years of diagnosis, survival after a diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis remains poor. Similar to patients with parenchymal brain metastasis only, the survival differs among different receptor subtypes. A closer examination to identify factors, such as introduction of new systemic therapies that might contribute to longer-term survival might provide insight to improve management of these patients. In addition, factors we identified that are associated with survival might be considered as stratification variables in the design of future randomized clinical trials in this population.",

Mass vaccination has taken place to control spread of infection with the most commonly used vaccines being Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. However, the adverse events associated with vaccination have not been fully investigated. Of concern are some serious cardiovascular events such as myocarditis, pericarditis or perimyocarditis development post-vaccination. In this report, we present an unusual case of acute perimyocarditis and pericardial effusion 10 days following the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination in Qatar. At the time of presentation, the patient presented with non-specific symptoms of headache, diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy and dehydration. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. Once admitted to the emergency department, she started to deteriorate with very low blood pressure readings reaching 40/33 mmHg which was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation. After 5.5 liters of intravenous fluids, echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed. Findings were consistent with pericardial effusion, signs of impending cardiac tamponade and acute perimyocarditis. Cardiac biomarkers including troponin T and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were elevated. Hospital course was complicated with cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemodynamic instability.

We have retrospectively analysed PES cases from two of the largest fetal medicine centres in the UK to determine the impact of results on management of a pregnancy.<h4>Design</h4>A retrospective review of clinical case notes.<h4>Setting</h4>Two tertiary fetal medicine centres.<h4>Population</h4>Pregnancies with fetal structural abnormalities referred to clinical genetics via a multidisciplinary team.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively reviewed the notes of all patients who had undergone PES. DNA samples were obtained via chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Variants were filtered using patient-specific panels and interpreted using American College of Medical Genetics guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>A molecular diagnosis was made in 42% (18/43) ongoing pregnancies; of this group, there was a significant management implication in 44% (8/18). A positive result contributed to the decision to terminate a pregnancy in 16% (7/43) of cases. A negative result had a significant impact on management in two cases by affirming the decision to continue pregnancy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrate that the results of PES can inform pregnancy management. Challenges include variant interpretation with limited phenotype information. These results emphasise the importance of the MDT and collecting phenotype and variant data. As this testing is soon to be widely available, we should look to move beyond diagnostic yield as a measure of the value of PES.<h4>Tweetable abstract</h4>Prenatal exome sequencing can aid decision-making in pregnancy management; review ahead of routine implementation in NHS.",

The compression of the cochlear nerve by the tumor was postulated to have caused deafness by injury to neurons adjacent and central to the tumor. There was profound degeneration of the vestibular nerve and sensory cells. A gelatinous material occluded the scala vestibuli, and the vestibular fluid spaces contained an amorphous proteinaceous substance. Fewer erythrocytes were seen in the vessels of the right cochlea, but there was no atrophy of capillaries to indicate long-term reduction of circulation.

Over a period of 3 years, anterior clinoidectomy was performed in 40 patients, 30 of whom harbored aneurysms (18 of the ICA and 13 of the basilar artery [one patient had two aneurysms]) and 10 of whom had tumors (four large pituitary tumors, four craniopharyngiomas, and two sphenoid ridge meningiomas). The ACP was removed extradurally in 31 cases and intradurally in nine cases. Extradural clinoidectomy was performed in all cases of pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma and in most cases of basilar artery aneurysm. Intradural clinoidectomy was performed in two cases of ICA-ophthalmic artery aneurysm, two cases of ICA-posterior communicating artery aneurysm, two cases of ICA cavernous aneurysm, one case of basilar artery aneurysm, and two cases of sphenoid ridge meningioma. The outcome was satisfactory in all patients, except for one patient who underwent clipping of a basilar tip aneurysm and suffered a thalamic and midbrain infarction. Three patients who underwent extradural clinoidectomy suffered a postoperative diminution of visual acuity or a visual field defect on the side of the clinoidectomy. These deficits may have been caused either by drilling of the ACP or by other operative manipulation of the optic nerve. Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, which required reoperation, occurred in one patient. The authors' experience suggests that the extradural technique of ACP removal is easier and less time consuming than the intradural one and provides better operative exposure. It can be used routinely in treating lesions in the supra- and parasellar regions.",

Primary renal PHA1 or autosomal dominant PHA1 is caused by mutations in mineralocorticoids receptor gene (NR3C2), while secondary PHA1 is frequently associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and/or urinary tract malformations (UTM). We report a 14-day-old male infant presenting with severe hyperkalemia, hyponatremic dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and markedly elevated serum aldosterone level, initially thought to have secondary PHA1 due to the associated UTI and posterior urethral valves. His serum aldosterone remained elevated at 5 months of age, despite resolution of salt wasting symptoms. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed a deletion of exons 3-5 in NR3C2 in the patient and his asymptomatic mother who also had elevated serum aldosterone level, confirming that he had primary or autosomal dominant PHA1. Our case raises the possibility that some patients with secondary PHA1 attributed to UTI and/or UTM may instead have primary autosomal dominant PHA1, for which genetic testing should be considered to identify the cause, determine future recurrence risk, and possibly prevent the life-threatening salt wasting in a subsequent family member.

All participating physicians agreed to follow the as low as reasonably achievable policy. A procedure was defined as ZFL when no fluoroscopy was used. The total fluoroscopy time inversely correlated to the number of procedures previously performed by each operator since study start (<i>r</i>=-0.112; <i>P</i>=0.02). Two hundred eighty-nine procedures (67.2%) were ZFL; multivariable analysis identified as predictors of ZFL: procedure after the 30th for each operator, compared with procedures up to the ninth (<i>P</i>=0.011; hazard ratio, 3.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79-6.80); the type of arrhythmia (<i>P</i>=0.031; electrophysiological study and atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia ablation having the highest probability of ZFL; hazard ratio, 6.87; 95% CI, 2.08-22.7 and hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.04-3.91, respectively); the operator's (<i>P</i>=0.002) and patient's age (<i>P</i>=0.009). Among operators, achievement of ZFL varied from 0% to 100%; 8 (22.8%) operators achieved ZFL in <25% of their procedures; 17 (48.6%) operators achieved ZFL in >75% of their procedures. The probability of ZFL increased by 2.8% (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99) as patient's age decreased by 1 year. Acute procedural success was obtained in all cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The use of 3-dimensional mapping system completely avoided the use of fluoroscopy in most cases, with very low fluoroscopy time in the remaining and high safety and effectiveness profiles. Achievement of ZFL was predicted by the type of arrhythmia, operator's experience, and patient's age.",

In the present study, we compared efficiency, safety, and efficacy of 'CLOSE'-guided PVI to conventional CF-guided PVI (CONV-CF).<h4>Methods and results</h4>Fifty consecutive paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) patients underwent PV encircling using a CF-sensing catheter targeting an interlesion distance (ILD) ≤6 mm and ablation index (AI) ≥400 and ≥550 at posterior and anterior wall ('CLOSE' group). Results were compared to the last 50 patients undergoing 'CONV-CF'. All patients underwent adenosine testing after PVI. Arrhythmia recurrence was defined as any atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATA) >30 s on Holter at 3, 6, and 12 months. Clinical characteristics did not differ. Contact force variability was comparable in between both groups (proportion of applications with intermittent contact 2% in 'CLOSE' vs. 1% in CONV-CF, P = 0.67). In the 'CLOSE' group, procedure time and radiofrequency (RF) time per circle were shorter (respectively 149 ± 33 min vs. 192 ± 42 min, P < 0.0001 and 18 ± 4 min vs 28 ± 7.5 min, P < 0.0001) and incidence of adenosine-proof isolation was higher (97% vs. 82%, P < 0.001). No complications were observed in the 'CLOSE' group, one tamponade in the 'CONV-CF' group. At 12 months, single-procedure freedom from ATA was 94% in 'CLOSE' vs. 80% in 'CONV-CF' group (P < 0.05). In both groups, the majority of reconnections at repeat were associated with either ILD > 6 mm and/or AI < 400/550 (100% vs. 83%, P = 0.99).<h4>Conclusion</h4>'CLOSE'-guided PVI improves procedural and 1 year outcome in CF-guided PVI while shortening procedure time. Improvement cannot be explained by differences in CF variability and is most likely due to the strict application of criteria for contiguity and ablation index. A randomized controlled trial is needed to exclude the possible contribution of a learning curve.",

Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,"In addition to the typical respiratory response, new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is also associated with very common gastrointestinal symptoms. Cases with gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to be complicated by liver injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If not treated in time, coma and circulatory failure may ensue. As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the human body through the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the gastrointestinal tract, the mechanism underlying the gastrointestinal symptoms may involve damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotion of the production of inflammatory factors. Indeed, after cells in the lungs become infected by SARS-CoV-2, effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells reach the small intestine through the gut-lung axis, causing intestinal immune damage and diarrhea; early extensive use of antibacterial and antiviral drugs can also lead to diarrhea in patients. Thus, treatment options for COVID-19 patients should be promptly adjusted when they have gastrointestinal symptoms. As SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of COVID-19 patients, future prevention and control efforts must consider the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of the virus.",

Two patients required mechanical ventilation for 6 and 9 months. Initial tests were normal or unrevealing, including the presence of nonspecific CSF pleocytosis, and normal or mild changes in brain MRI. Eventually, all patients had dramatic recovery of cognitive functions, although one had bilateral leg amputation due to systemic complications. Antibodies to NR1/NR2 heteromers were found in archived serum or CSF but not in long-term follow-up samples.

A shared deficient serotonergic transmission was postulated for both syndromes. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was argued to regulate eating behaviour and to be dysfunctional in eating disorders.<h4>Methods</h4>Fourteen women meeting DSM-IV criteria for BN were included in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial. In order to exclude patients highly responsive to placebo, all patients were first submitted to a one-week sham treatment. Randomisation was followed by 3 weeks of active treatment or sham stimulation. As the main outcome criterion we defined the change in binges and purges. Secondary outcome variables were the decrease of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) over time.<h4>Results</h4>The average number of binges per day declined significantly between baseline and the end of treatment in the two groups. There was no significant difference between sham and active stimulation in terms of purge behaviour, BDI, HDRS and YBOCS over time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These preliminary results indicate that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of BN does not exert additional benefit over placebo. A larger number of patients might clarify a further role of rTMS in the treatment of BN.",

The hampered results in this prefrontal executive task parallel the reduction in prefrontal blood perfusion and metabolism in depressed subjects. A neuropsychological activation study with the verbal fluency paradigm could evaluate a possible blunted increase in perfusion in the prefrontal cortex in depressed suicidal patients. Twenty clinically depressed patients who had recently attempted suicide and 20 healthy volunteers were included in a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) split-dose activation study following a verbal fluency paradigm. Statistical parametric mapping was used to determine voxelwise significant changes. Differences in regional cortical activation between the letter fluency and category fluency tasks in attempted suicide patients were found. These patients showed a blunted increase in perfusion in the prefrontal cortex. Methodological restrictions concerning group uniformity, medication bias and subjective effort of the participants are discussed. Our findings indicate a blunted increase in prefrontal blood perfusion as a possible biological reason for reduced drive and loss of initiative in attempted suicide patients.",

Rates of renal replacement therapy, mortality, and serious adverse events were secondary outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 409 patients (median age, 66 years; men, 58.2%) were included in the study, with a median time to study drug administration of 3.5 hours after diagnosis of shock. The number of survivors who never developed kidney failure was 94 of 165 patients (57.0%) in the vasopressin group and 93 of 157 patients (59.2%) in the norepinephrine group (difference, -2.3% [95% CI, -13.0% to 8.5%]). The median number of kidney failure-free days for patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney failure, or both was 9 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1 to -24) in the vasopressin group and 13 days (IQR, 1 to -25) in the norepinephrine group (difference, -4 days [95% CI, -11 to 5]). There was less use of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group (25.4% for vasopressin vs 35.3% for norepinephrine; difference, -9.9% [95% CI, -19.3% to -0.6%]). There was no significant difference in mortality rates between groups. In total, 22 of 205 patients (10.7%) had a serious adverse event in the vasopressin group vs 17 of 204 patients (8.3%) in the norepinephrine group (difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -3.3% to 8.2%]).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Among adults with septic shock, the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure-free days. Although these findings do not support the use of vasopressin to replace norepinephrine as initial treatment in this situation, the confidence interval included a potential clinically important benefit for vasopressin, and larger trials may be warranted to assess this further.<h4>Trial registration</h4>clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: ISRCTN 20769191.",

The aim of this study was to identify prevalence and risk factors of hyperaminotransferasemia in an adult cohort of AN patients and to describe evolution during nutritional rehabilitation with enteral nutrition for a period of 4 weeks.<h4>Methods</h4>Retrospective study of all consecutive malnourished (BMI <16) AN adult patients, without previous liver diseases or hepatotoxic drugs or alcohol consumption, hospitalized for enteral nutrition in a single center between 1998 and 2008. Hypertransaminasemia was defined by an increase in AST and (or) ALT >2N.<h4>Results</h4>In all, 126 AN patients (117 W, 9 M), age 30 ± 10.8 years, were included. At admission, 54 (43%) patients presented hypertransaminasemia. In univariate analysis, risk factors for hypertransaminasemia were: lower BMI (11.2 ± 2 vs. 13 ± 2, p < 0.0001) and age (28 ± 9 vs. 32 ± 12, p < 0.05), male sex (p < 0.05) and the pure restrictive form (p = 0.07). In multivariate analysis only BMI, at a threshold of 12, remained significant [OR 3.7, CI: 95% 2.24-5.2]. Normalization of aminotransferases at the end of week 4 of enteral nutrition was obtained in 96%. Only 2/54 patients (4%) presented a worsening of aminotransferases during the refeeding period, including one that died of liver failure. None of the patients without hypertransaminasemia admission presented a subsequent elevation. At the end of the 4-week refeeding period, the increase in BMI was greater in patients without hypertransaminasemia than in those with it (2.0 ± 0.8 vs. 1.5 ± 1.0, p < 0.0001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Elevated transaminases is common in severe malnourished AN patients. Four risk factors were identified: young age, low BMI (the only independent factor in multivariate analysis), the pure restrictive form of the disease and male sex. After 4 weeks of enteral nutrition the evolution is in most cases favourable, albeit with a lower increase in BMI, but can be severe. The long-term evolution remains to be determined.",

Differences of the amplitudes of the distortion products of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) between the tumor ear and the nontumor ear were studied at frequencies of 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, and 4 kHz. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the ears for both groups and to test for possible differences in tumor size between groups.<h4>Results</h4>DPOAE amplitudes do not differ strongly between the ears in VS patients with normal/symmetrical hearing (two-sided P values: .050 at 1 kHz, .182 at 1.4 kHz, .378 at 2 kHz, .293 at 2.8 kHz, and .238 at 4 kHz) but are decreased compared with the nontumor ear at frequencies 1, 1.4, 2, and 2.8 kHz in VS patients with even mild HL (two-sided P values: .013 at 1 kHz, .007 at 1.4 kHz, .033 at 2 kHz, .010 at 2.8 kHz, and .156 at 4 kHz). Tumor size did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = .436).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Amplitudes of DPOAEs begin to decrease even at the early stages of HL in VS patients, which suggests a cochlear origin of early HL in these patients. DPOAEs may be used in a clinical setting to monitor progression of cochlear damage at the early stages of hearing impairment in VS patients.",

The objective of this scoping review was to identify what is known about the use of ES for genetic testing in prenatal cases with known or suspected genetic disease. A rapid scoping review was conducted over a six-week timeframe of English-language peer-reviewed studies. Search strategies for major databases (e.g., Medline) and gray literature were developed, and peer reviewed by information specialists. Identified studies were categorized and charted using tables and diagrams. Twenty-four publications were included from seven countries published between 2014 and 2019. Most commonly reported outcomes were diagnostic yields, which varied widely from 5% to 57%, and prenatal phenotype. Few studies reported clinical outcomes related to impact, decision-making, and clinical utility. Qualitative studies (n = 6) provided useful insights into patient and health-care provider experiences with ES. Findings suggest prenatal ES is beneficial, but more research is needed to better understand the clinical utility, circumstances for ideal use, feasibility, and costs of offering rapid ES as a routine option for prenatal genetic testing.",

However, the immunomodulatory effects of concomitant intestinal parasitic infection in cholera patients have not been systematically evaluated.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated V. cholerae-specific immune responses in a cohort of patients with severe cholera. 361 patients completed 21 days of observation and 53 (15%) had evidence of a concomitant intestinal parasitic infection based on direct microscopy. Although there were no significant differences in the vibriocidal or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific immune responses to V. cholerae, helminth-infected cholera patients had decreased fecal and serum IgA immune responses to the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) as well as a more modest decrease in serum IgG response to CTB. These findings remained significant for all classes of helminth infection and when controlling for potential confounding variables such as age and nutritional status. Although we hypothesized the differential effect on CTB and LPS immune responses was due to T-cell-dependent immunomodulatory effects of helminth infection, we did not find additional evidence to support a classic Th1 or Th2 polarization of the immune response to V. cholerae infection related to parasite infection.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>The finding that helminth infection has a profound association with the mucosal humoral immune response to V. cholerae has implications for the development of protective immunity in cholera-endemic areas and provides an additional basis for deworming programs in cholera-endemic areas. Additional studies, including further characterization of the role of T cells in the immune response to human V. cholerae infection and the development of an animal model of co-infection, may provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying these findings.",https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000403&type=printable

She described a severe, pulsating pain in the left wrist and hand, with hypersensitivity, allodynia, a marked reduction in strength, and swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers. Pain began three months previously, after a trauma to the left wrist. The diagnostic tests performed were negative. At the first visit we recommended oral tramadol. During the first two sessions we used somatic acupuncture. At the third session, the girl reported suffering intolerable pain in the affected limb during the previous sessions, so we decided to use abdominal acupuncture.

A 51-year-old female with confusion and abdominal pain was brought to the emergency department (ED). She had a significant past medical history of type ll diabetes mellitus and recurrent urinary tract infections. Prior to the arrival to the hospital, she was conscious but confused and noted to have a low blood glucose level, which was managed with glucose per orally by emergency medical services. While in ED patient was dehydrated and hemodynamically unstable. She failed to respond to intravenous fluids hence vasopressors along with ceftriaxone were initiated. Intubation for mechanical ventilation was performed for respiratory failure and evolving septic shock, sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidosis was started and antibiotics were stepped up to vancomycin and cefepime. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Her kidney function continued to worsen, and she remained profoundly acidotic despite aggressive measures. A diagnosis of concomitant MALA was made since vasopressor requirement was less than expected considering the severity of acidosis. Emergent CRRT was initiated, resulting in improvement of acidosis in 24 hours. After she was stabilized vasopressors were stopped, she was extubated, and antibiotics were de-escalated to the oral regimen.

1238,11555538,Physiology of vasopressin relevant to management of septic shock.,10.1378/chest.120.3.989,"Holmes CL, Patel BM, Russell JA, Walley KR.",2001,Chest,"Vasopressin is emerging as a rational therapy for the hemodynamic support of septic shock and vasodilatory shock due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The goal of this review is to understand the physiology of vasopressin relevant to septic shock in order to maximize its safety and efficacy in clinical trials and in subsequent therapeutic use. Vasopressin is both a vasopressor and an antidiuretic hormone. It also has hemostatic, GI, and thermoregulatory effects, and is an adrenocorticotropic hormone secretagogue. Vasopressin is released from the axonal terminals of magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus. Vasopressin mediates vasoconstriction via V1-receptor activation on vascular smooth muscle and mediates its antidiuretic effect via V2-receptor activation in the renal collecting duct system. In addition, vasopressin, at low plasma concentrations, mediates vasodilation in coronary, cerebral, and pulmonary arterial circulations. Septic shock causes first a transient early increase in blood vasopressin concentrations that decrease later in septic shock to very low levels compared to other causes of hypotension. Vasopressin infusion of 0.01 to 0.04 U/min in patients with septic shock increases plasma vasopressin levels to those observed in patients with hypotension from other causes, such as cardiogenic shock. Increased vasopressin levels are associated with a lesser need for other vasopressors. Urinary output may increase, and pulmonary vascular resistance may decrease. Infusions of > 0.04 U/min may lead to adverse, likely vasoconstriction-mediated events. Because clinical studies have been relatively small, focused on physiologic end points, and because of potential adverse effects of vasopressin, clinical use of vasopressin should await a randomized controlled trial of its effects on clinical outcomes such as organ failure and mortality.",

The samples were tested by Real-time PCR, for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Yates-corrected chi squared, or Fisher's exact test were used to compare both animal-health status and positivity/negativity to pathogens, and the relationship between presence/absence of clinical signs and Real-time PCR-positivity. H. somni and BCoV were the most frequently identified pathogens. In BRD-diagnosed cattle, BAdV was detected in 13.8% (19/138), BRSV in 14.5% (20/138) and BPiV in 4.3% (6/138). Healthy cattle were mostly positive for H. somni (89.2%, 83/93). A statistically significant association was observed between clinical signs and positivity to M. haemolytica (p value = 0.016). Although mass-medication and vaccination are used for BRD control, it still remains a primary health problem.

An abdominal ultrasound scan incidentally detected a large heterogeneous mass in the left upper quadrant. CT and MRI scans indicated a rapidly growing unilocular cystic mass in the pancreatic tail. Grossly, the resected pancreatic mass measured 7×5×5 cm and consisted of a unilocular cystic lesion that had several solid mural nodules. Microscopically, the cystic wall showed two carcinomatous components, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma. The solid lesion predominantly consisted of pleomorphic spindle cells arranged in interlacing fascicles which had infiltrated the adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. In some areas of this sarcomatous component, anaplastic carcinoma cells intermingled with or transformed into spindle cells. Immunohistochemically, the carcinomatous components were strongly positive for epithelial markers, and transforming anaplastic carcinoma cells were immunoreactive for both epithelial markers and vimentin; in contrast, the sarcomatous component was strongly positive for only vimentin. Additionally, an identical mutation (G to A transition) at codon 12 of K-ras gene and concordant immunoreactivity for p53 protein were detected in the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. These findings suggested that the pancreatic carcinosarcoma could be of monoclonal origin, and that the sarcomatous component might have arisen from metaplastic transformation of the carcinomatous component.",

Although HCT with MAC is preferred to reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) for most patients ⩽60 years with AML/myelodysplastic syndrome and ALL, RIC and nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimens allow HCT for many otherwise ineligible patients. Reduced intensity preparative regimens have produced high rates of PFS for diagnoses, which are highly sensitive to GVM.

To investigate its possible role, we have analyzed the coding exons of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) for germline mutations. In ten independent cases of Denys-Drash syndrome, point mutations in the zinc finger domains of one WT1 gene copy were found. Nine of these mutations are found within exon 9 (zinc finger III); the remaining mutation is in exon 8 (zinc finger II). These mutations directly affect DNA sequence recognition. In two families analyzed, the mutations were shown to arise de novo. Wilms' tumors from three individuals and one juvenile granulosa cell tumor demonstrate reduction to homozygosity for the mutated WT1 allele. Our results provide evidence of a direct role for WT1 in Denys-Drash syndrome and thus urogenital system development.",
1248,7436289,On the natural history and comparative pathology of the blue naevus.,,Levene A.,1980,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,"In man the epidermis is the final destination for most of the melanocytes which are of neural crest origin, and they migrate to a variety of sites. Dermal melanocytic distribution, conspicuous in some lower animals, has a very restricted normal distribution in man, and of the variety of anomalies which exist the blue naevus is the most frequently encountered. It is comparable to the common melanocytoma of dog and hamster. More widespread dermal melanocytoses are rare, and a unique case in which death from melanoma supervened, recently recorded by the author, is an example of a syndrome the only parallel to which appears to be equine melanotic disease, a disorder of aging, greying horses. It is argued on comparative grounds that the newly described syndrome and equine melanotic disease are examples of a neurochristic disorder involving the cephalad segments and dermal melanocytes.",

Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) of the liver is a benign focal liver mass that may mimic a malignant liver tumor. Although rarely encountered in clinical practice, it often poses diagnostic and management dilemmas. Methods. Cases diagnosed as hepatic RLH between January 1996 and June 2011 were investigated in a retrospective study. Clinicopathological features as well as follow-up information of the cases were studied. Results. A total of seven cases of hepatic RLH were investigated, with a median age of 46 years (range: 33-76 years). Hepatic RLH was accompanied by concomitant diseases in some patients. The average size of hepatic lesions of our cases was 45 mm (range: 15-105 mm). All of the cases were not accurately diagnosed until confirmed by pathological findings, and surgical resections were performed for all. Postoperative course was uneventful for all of the patients during followup. Conclusions. RLH of the liver is a rare benign disease with a female predilection of unknown etiology. It is very difficult to correctly diagnose this disease without pathological results. Subtle differences on radiological findings of it may be helpful for differential diagnosis from other diseases. Curative resection of the lesion is suggested for the treatment of this disease.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/357694.pdf

Currently, there is a lack of evidence on the persistence of specific antibodies. We investigated the generation and maintenance of neutralizing antibodies of convalescent SARS-CoV-2-afflicted patients over a ten-month period post-primary infection using an immunofluorescence assay, a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay and an in-house enzyme-linked neutralization assay. We present the successful application of an improved version of the plaque-reduction neutralization assay which can be analysed optometrically to simplify data interpretation. Based on the results of the enzyme-linked neutralization assay, neutralizing antibodies were maintained in 77.4% of convalescent individuals without relevant decay over ten months. Furthermore, a positive correlation between severity of infection and antibody titre was observed. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2-afflicted individuals have been proven to be able to develop and maintain neutralizing antibodies over a period of ten months after primary infection.

Almost one-third of human brains present this variant. Occlusion of the artery of Percheron mostly results in a bilateral medial thalamic infarction, which usually manifests with altered consciousness (including coma), vertical gaze paresis, and cognitive disturbance. The presentation is similar to the ""top of the basilar syndrome"", and early recognition should be prompted. We describe the case of a young female with this vessel variant who experienced a bilateral thalamic stroke. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated bilateral thalamic infarcts and a truncated artery of Percheron. Occlusion of the vessel was presumably due to embolism from a patent foramen ovale. Thrombolysis was performed, with incomplete symptom remission, cognitive impairment, and persistence of speech disorders.

Robust data from phase 3 randomized studies evaluating second-line therapy for chronic GVHD are lacking. In retrospective surveys, ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK1-JAK2) inhibitor, showed potential efficacy in patients with glucocorticoid-refractory or -dependent chronic GVHD.<h4>Methods</h4>This phase 3 open-label, randomized trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib at a dose of 10 mg twice daily, as compared with the investigator's choice of therapy from a list of 10 commonly used options considered best available care (control), in patients 12 years of age or older with moderate or severe glucocorticoid-refractory or -dependent chronic GVHD. The primary end point was overall response (complete or partial response) at week 24; key secondary end points were failure-free survival and improved score on the modified Lee Symptom Scale at week 24.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 329 patients underwent randomization; 165 patients were assigned to receive ruxolitinib and 164 patients to receive control therapy. Overall response at week 24 was greater in the ruxolitinib group than in the control group (49.7% vs. 25.6%; odds ratio, 2.99; P<0.001). Ruxolitinib led to longer median failure-free survival than control (>18.6 months vs. 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.37; P<0.001) and higher symptom response (24.2% vs. 11.0%; odds ratio, 2.62; P = 0.001). The most common (occurring in ≥10% patients) adverse events of grade 3 or higher up to week 24 were thrombocytopenia (15.2% in the ruxolitinib group and 10.1% in the control group) and anemia (12.7% and 7.6%, respectively). The incidence of cytomegalovirus infections and reactivations was similar in the two groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Among patients with glucocorticoid-refractory or -dependent chronic GVHD, ruxolitinib led to significantly greater overall response, failure-free survival, and symptom response. The incidence of thrombocytopenia and anemia was greater with ruxolitinib. (Funded by Novartis and Incyte; REACH3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03112603.).",

The patient presented with amenorrhea for 40 days and abdominal distention for 27 days. A liver mass had been detected 6 days prior to presentation. Using ultrasound (US), a hyperechoic mass with a fluid sonolucent area was detected in the right hepatic lobe. Examination by computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a mass in the right hepatic lobe with a slightly low-density peripheral region and an oval central portion of lower density in the plain scan; the enhanced scan revealed a significantly enhanced peripheral region and a non-enhanced central portion. <sup>18</sup>F-fluodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed a mass in the right hepatic lobe with an increased intake of FDG in the peripheral region (maximum standard uptake value, 5.7) and a non-increased intake of FDG in the central portion. The patient was then subjected to hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. Histopathologically, the mass was an ectopic pregnancy. The patient recovered following the surgery. In conclusion, a timely diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was made for a 31-year-old women with an ectopic pregnancy in the liver on the basis of US, CT and PET-CT imaging results, which enabled surgery to be undertaken prior to any serious consequences.

Diagnosis was made based on positive transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) findings and a raised troponin, not in the context of suspected acute coronary syndrome. We recommend that patients with negative coronavirus tests should still be considered at risk of potential sequelae from the disease. There should be a low threshold for performing basic cardiac investigations: ECG, troponin and TTE as well as seeking a cardiology opinion. Colchicine is a recognised treatment for viral pericarditis and should be considered as adjunctive treatment; however, further research is required specific to SARS-CoV-2.",

STHVH consisted of a 4-hr period during which 35 L of ultrafiltrate is removed and neutral fluid balance is maintained. Subsequent conventional continuous venovenous hemofiltration continued for at least 4 days.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, oxygen delivery, mixed venous oxygen saturation, arterial pH, and lactate were measured serially. Fluid and inotropic support were managed by protocol. Therapeutic endpoints were as follows during STHVH: a) by 2 hrs, a > or =50% increase in cardiac index; b) by 2 hrs, a > or =25% increase in mixed venous saturation; c) by 4 hrs, an increase in arterial pH to >7.3; d) by 4 hrs, a > or =50% reduction in epinephrine dose. Patients who attained all four goals (11 of 20) were considered hemodynamic ""responders""; patients who did not (9 of 20) were considered hemodynamic ""nonresponders."" There were no differences in baseline hemodynamic, metabolic, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation and Simplified Acute Physiology Scores between responders and nonresponders. Survival to 28 days was better among responders (9 of 11 patients) than among nonresponders (0 of 9). Factors associated with survival were hemodynamic-metabolic response status, time interval from ICU admission to initiation of STHVH, and body weight.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data suggest that STHVH may be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of intractable cardiocirculatory failure complicating septic shock. Early initiation of therapy and adequate dose may improve hemodynamic and metabolic responses and 28-day survival.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term surgical results of calcaneal lipomas, representing a relatively rare localization for this type of tumors. The present study included 21 calcaneal lipoma cases (22 feet) referred to our podiatry clinic between 1991 and 2001 with complaints of foot and heel pain resistant to conservative treatment for the last 3-6 months. In all cases, the diagnosis of calcaneal intraosseous lipoma was first confirmed radiologically, then histologically. The mean age was 39 years (range 16-62), 15 were females (71%) and 6 were males (29%). One patient had bilateral disease, whereas 11 and 9 patients had right and left calcaneal involvement, respectively. None of the patients have a palpable mass in their foot. For pre-operative differential diagnosis, 3 patients had computerized tomography examination (CT scan) and 8 patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All lesions were totally curetted out with angled curettes. The defect was filled with cancellous autografts taken from the ipsilateral iliac crest. In only four patients, the amount of autograft was not sufficient, so a combination of cancellous allograft and autograft was used. No drain was used. An elastic bandage was wrapped around the foot and ankle, and cold packs were applied to the surgical site. The mean duration of follow up was 94 (45-143) months. Pain improved in 17 feet at 4 months, in an additional 4 feet at 8 months and in the remaining one foot at 12 months. The mean time to the graft consolidation was 5 months (range 3-7 months). There were no recurrences or pathological fractures during the follow up. No wound infection or necrosis was seen at the surgical sites. There were no neurovascular complications. Five cases experienced pain in the iliac bone for 1 month, due to grafting procedures. Although calcaneal intraosseous lipoma accounts for a small portion of cases in the huge differential diagnosis chart for foot pain, it should be kept in mind as a possible diagnosis in unresolved cases. Most of the patients would benefit from non-surgical treatments. But if this is not the case, surgical treatment is indicated. In conclusion, curettage and autogenous bone grafting is an easy and effective method for the surgical treatment of calcaneal intraosseous lipomas.",

This study aimed to evaluate effects of an early progressive rehabilitation intervention in mechanically ventilated adults at risk.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a parallel, two-arm, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial with 6-months follow-up that was conducted in a mixed ICU of an academic centre in Switzerland. Previously independent, mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults with expected critical care stay ≥72 hours (n = 115) were randomised to a control group receiving standard physiotherapy including early mobilisation or to an experimental group with early endurance and resistance training combined with mobilisation. Primary endpoints were functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Distance) and functional independence (Functional Independence Measure) at hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints including muscle strength were assessed at critical care discharge. Safety was monitored closely by standard monitoring and predefined adverse events.<h4>Results</h4>Physiotherapy started within 48 hours of critical care admission while 97% of participants were still ventilated and 68% on inotropes. Compared to the control group (n = 57), the experimental group (n = 58) received significantly more physiotherapy (sessions: 407 vs 377, p<0.001; time/session: 25min vs 18min, p<0.001) and had less days with sedation (p<0.001). Adverse events were rare (0.6%) and without consequences. There were no significant between-group differences in 6-Minute Walk Distance (experimental 123m (IQR 25-280) vs control 100m (IQR 0-300); p = 0.542) or functional independence (98 (IQR 66-119) vs 98 (IQR 18-115); p = 0.308).

The dysregulation of the HPA axis is complex, involving multidirectional crosstalk between the CRH/ACTH pathways, autonomic nervous system, vasopressinergic system, and immune system. Recent studies have demonstrated that plasma clearance of cortisol is markedly reduced during critical illness, explained by suppressed expression and activity of the primary cortisol-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and kidney. Despite the elevated cortisol levels during critical illness, tissue resistance to glucocorticoids is believed to occur due to insufficient glucocorticoid alpha-mediated anti-inflammatory activity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Novel insights into the pathophysiology of CIRCI add to the limitations of the current diagnostic tools to identify at-risk patients and may also impact how corticosteroids are used in patients with CIRCI.",

Patients were categorized as having severe (n=128) or limited (n=52) Wegener's granulomatosis.<h4>Results</h4>When all ANCA detection methods were combined, 166 patients (92%) were ANCA positive, including 96% with severe disease and 83% with limited disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ANCA are detectable in nearly all patients with active severe Wegener's granulomatosis, but approximately 1 of 5 patients with active limited disease are ANCA negative. Immunofluorescence and both direct and capture ELISAs are required for optimal detection, suggesting that ANCA are not recognized equally well by all testing methods.",

Many studies have demonstrated that chemo-radiotherapy for cancer patients and exposure to certain chemicals may increase the risk of secondary MDS, which is characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities and genomic alterations. Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely used for the diagnosis of cancer patients, advanced analysis of the sequencing data may provide supplementary information for secondary MDS.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A male patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bone metastases has presented distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar, mediastinal lymph node metastases, and multiple bone metastases. This patient has undergone long-term exposures to certain chemicals. Moreover, the deletion of chromosome 7 and 5q is detected in his peripheral blood sequencing, indicating secondary MDS, subsequently confirmed by bone marrow examination.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this case, an NSCLC patient was diagnosed with secondary MDS via NGS analysis, indicating that the NGS analysis may serve as supplementary for diagnosis of secondary MDS and provide useful information of therapeutic regimens for subsequent-line treatment of EGFR-mutated lung cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of acquired MDS in a lung adenocarcinoma patient.",https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12920-021-01147-y

However, few studies specifically addressed the role of the constructs, ""presence of MiL"" and ""search for MiL,"" and their dynamic interplay. In this cross-sectional study of patients with SB (N = 199) visiting a psychiatric Emergency Department for either suicidal ideation (SI) or suicide attempt (SA), we pursued the following objectives: 1) to explore the relationship between the two constructs; 2) to verify the protective value of presence of MiL on SB; and 3) to assess the influence of search for MiL on the relationship between presence of MiL and SI. The two constructs were found to be independent of one another. Higher presence of MiL was globally associated with lower SB levels, particularly SI. Search for MiL was not related to SB and did not moderate the relationship between presence of MiL and SI. In conclusion, formal support for the role of presence of MiL against SB in a psychiatric sample was demonstrated. These findings, with a view toward refinement of SB risk assessment and new psychotherapeutic approaches, may lead to an enrichment of the dialogue with suicidal patients to help alleviate their unbearable suffering. Our conclusions must be replicated in psychiatric clinical populations in settings other than a psychiatric ED and by using a longitudinal prospective and case-control study design.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00327/pdf

1275,6671916,Treatment of avascular necrosis of the femoral head.,,Ficat RP.,1983,The Hip,"We believe that all bone necrosis passes through a preradiologic stage, which is either painful and therefore Stage I or asymptomatic and therefore Stage O. Moreover, the diagnosis of osteonecrosis cannot be made by standard x-ray technique, which means that a normal x-ray examination does not guarantee that the hip is normal. The diagnosis in the early stage can be made only through the functional exploration of bone. In spite of multiple etiologies, there exists a pathophysiologic unity that centers around the circulatory disorder and is dominated by stasis. We believe that this explains the clinical and radiologic similarity of diverse causes of ischemic necrosis of bone. The medical treatment, preventive or prophylactic, is based on the causes and therefore is specific to the etiology of the avascular necrosis, whether that be cessation of drinking alcohol or reduction of steroid therapy. The interruptive treatment, however, which aborts the progression of the disease, rests on early diagnosis and core decompression. This dependence of results of treatment on timing has also been borne out by other authors as well, including Hungerford and Zizic and Marcus et al.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a stepwise transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided zero-fluoroscopy approach (ZFA) for RFA.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients (n = 111) referred for AF-ablation were prospectively enrolled with intention to RFA with ZFA. Procedural outcomes were compared with historical controls (HCs) after 1:1 propensity score matching. ZFA success was considered when no X-ray was utilized to perform the whole procedure.<h4>Results</h4>ZFA success was achieved in 80 (72%) procedures. BMI > 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> resulted in the only independent predictor of ZFA failure (OR = 6.10, 95% CI 1.15-46.49, p = 0.04). In comparison to HCs, a significant reduction in radiation exposure was observed in the ZFA group: fluoroscopy time (3 vs. 63 s, p < 0.001), total emitted fluoroscopy dose (0.2 vs. 6.0 mGy, p < 0.001), dose area product (0.04 vs. 1.4 Gy*cm<sup>2</sup>, p < 0.001), and effective dose (0.8 vs. 27.2 mSv*100, p < 0.001).

The incidence of pediatric thrombophilia differs across countries, and is unknown in Japan. We sent a survey to 520 pediatric department heads and 629 specialists, requesting details on patients who developed symptomatic thromboembolism between 2006 and 2010. Of 280 eligible cases, congenital thrombophilia and other conditions were reported. Congenital thrombophilia (n = 54, 19.3 %) comprised defects in protein C (27), protein S (9), and antithrombin (7). None had mutations in factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A, both of which are frequent in Caucasians. Non-congenital causes of thrombophilia included congenital heart disease, the use of central venous catheters, nephrotic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and malignancy with or without use of L-asparaginase. Patients with congenital thrombophilia developed thromboembolism at a significantly younger age (median 1.0 vs. 5.0 years, p = 0.014), had a higher frequency of consanguinity (35.2 vs. 1.8 %, p < 0.001) and post-thrombotic syndromes (29.6 vs. 13.3 %, p = 0.007) than those who did not.

Clinical symptomatic pituitary apoplexy is a well-described syndrome characterized by sudden headaches, visual impairment, hypopituitarism and, at times, impaired consciousness. Subclinical pituitary apoplexy is characterized by minimal atypical clinical manifestations and, as a result, may be misdiagnosed or inappropriately treated. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations, surgical outcome and post-operative pituitary function in patients who had clinical or subclinical pituitary apoplexy. We retrospectively identified 65 patients (30 men, 35 women; age range 21-87 years, mean age 48.4 years) who underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Of these, 25 patients were diagnosed as having clinical apoplexy, while the remaining 40 patients were classified as having subclinical pituitary apoplexy. The follow-up period ranged from 21 to 73 months (mean 44 months). Vision improved in 14 of 22 patients with clinical apoplexy (64%) and in 26 of 28 patients with subclinical apoplexy (93%) (p=0.017); the total resection rate was 57% and 42%, respectively (p=0.285). After 2 years of follow-up, hormone replacement therapy was needed in only 26% and 36% of patients, respectively (p=0.149). Our findings suggest that the incidence of subclinical pituitary apoplexy is higher than that of clinical pituitary apoplexy. Both the tumor resection rate and mean age were higher in those with clinical pituitary apoplexy, while those who had subclinical pituitary apoplexy demonstrated better visual improvement. During long-term follow-up, the need for hormonal replacement decreased in both groups.",

Fifteen adolescents with AN and 15 matched controls carried out IGT after being clinically and neuropsychologically evaluated. An interesting generalized estimating equation approach showed that four independent clinical variables, and not the group, explained IGT performances, such as blocks repetition, anxiety, psychogenic eating disorders and self transcendence. The impairment of decision making is not related to the diagnosis of AN, but it is driven by high levels of anxiety and self transcendence. Instead, some psychogenic eating disorders traits, related to illness severity, positively affected IGT performance in the whole sample. IGT impairment in AN found by prior studies could be related to these clinical features which are not always taken into account.",

The diagnosis of an acute ischemic infarction, where the damage of brain tissue may still be reversible, enables selection of appropriate treatment and contributes to a more favourable outcome. For these reasons it is essential to recognize common neurovascular variants in the territory of the posterior cerebral circulation, one of which is the artery of Percheron.<h4>Case report</h4>A 69 year-old woman, last seen awake 10 hours earlier, presented with two typical clinical features of the artery of Percheron infarction, which were vertical gaze palsy and coma. Brain CT and CTA of neck and intracranial arteries upon arrival were interpreted as normal. A new brain CT scan performed 24 hours later revealed hypodensity in the medial parts of thalami. Other imaging modalities were not performed, due to the presumption that the window for the application of effective therapy was over. The diagnosis of an artery of Percheron infarction was therefore made retrospectively with the re-examination of the CTA of neck and intracranial arteries.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A multi-modality imaging approach is necessary in every patient with suspicion of the posterior circulation infarction immediately after the onset of symptoms, especially in cases where primary imaging modalities are unremarkable and clinical features are severe, where follow-up examinations are indicated.",https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/raon-2014-0037

In pediatric patients with ATD, thrombosis typically develops during the neonatal period or adolescence. However, to date there are no consistent recommendations on the therapeutic management of children with ATD. Inferior vena cava atresia (IVCA) belongs to a range of congenital or acquired vena cava malformations and is described as an independent risk factor for thrombosis. The present case report explores two cases of combined ATD and IVCA in an adolescent and his mother.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 14-year-old male presented with extensive deep venous thromboses (DVTs) of both lower extremities as well as an IVCA. The patient had previously been diagnosed with an asymptomatic ATD without therapeutic consequences at that time. His mother was suffering from an ATD and had herself just been diagnosed with IVCA, too. The DVTs in the adolescent were treated by systemic anticoagulation and catheter-directed local thrombolysis causing favourable results. Yet, despite adequate oral anticoagulation the DVTs in both lower extremities reoccurred within 1 week after the patient was discharged from hospital. This time, thrombolysis could not be fully achieved. Surprisingly, probing and stenting of the IVCA was achieved, indicating an acquired IVCA which could have occurred after undetected thrombosis in early childhood. Genetic analyses showed the same mutation causing ATD in both son and mother: heterozygote missense mutation c.248 T > C, p.(Leu83Pro), within the heparin binding domain of antithrombin. This mutation was never reported in mutation databases before.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge this is the first case report discussing combined ATD and IVCA in two family members. Since ATDs present with clinical heterogeneity, taking a thorough family history is crucial for the anticipation of possible complications in affected children and decisions on targeted diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. Affected families must be educated on risk factors and clinical signs of thrombosis and need an immediate diagnostic workup in case of clinical symptoms. IVCA in patients with ATD could occur due to thrombotic occlusion at a very early age. Therefore, in case of family members with IVCA and ATD ultrasound screening in newborns should be considered.",https://thrombosisjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12959-021-00360-0

Interventions ranged from patient education, to prone positioning, to early mobilization and respiratory therapy. Patients were often unstable with quick exacerbation of symptoms and a slow and fluctuant recovery. Additionally, many patients who were critically ill developed severe weakness, postextubation dysphagia, weaning failure, or presented with anxiety or delirium. In this setting, physical therapy was challenging and required specialized and individualized therapeutic strategies. Most patients adopted the proposed treatment strategies, and lung function and physical strength improved over time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Physical therapists clearly have a role in the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our experience in Switzerland, we recommend that physical therapists routinely screen and assess patients for respiratory symptoms and exercise tolerance on acute wards. Treatment of patients who are critically ill should start as soon as possible to limit further sequelae. More research is needed for awake prone positioning and early breathing exercises as well as post-COVID rehabilitation.<h4>Impact</h4>To date, there are few data on the physical therapist management of patients with COVID-19.

Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes.<h4>Methods</h4>SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results.<h4>Results</h4>During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5-17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6-98.9%) respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance.

We investigated the incidence of dysphagia, its time course, and association with clinically relevant outcomes in extubated critically ill patients.<h4>Design</h4>Prospective observational trial with systematic dysphagia screening and follow-up until 90 days or death.<h4>Settings</h4>ICU of a tertiary care academic center.<h4>Patients</h4>One thousand three-hundred four admissions of mixed adult ICU patients (median age, 66.0 yr [interquartile range, 54.0-74.0]; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score, 19.0 [interquartile range, 14.0-24.0]) were screened for postextubation dysphagia. Primary ICU admissions (n = 933) were analyzed and followed up until 90 days or death. Patients from an independent academic center served as confirmatory cohort (n = 220).<h4>Interventions</h4>Bedside screening for dysphagia was performed within 3 hours after extubation by trained ICU nurses. Positive screening triggered confirmatory specialist bedside swallowing examinations and follow-up until hospital discharge.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Dysphagia screening was positive in 12.4% (n = 116/933) after extubation (18.3% of emergency and 4.9% of elective patients) and confirmed by specialists within 24 hours from positive screening in 87.3% (n = 96/110, n = 6 missing data). The dysphagia incidence at ICU discharge was 10.3% (n = 96/933) of which 60.4% (n = 58/96) remained positive until hospital discharge. Days on feeding tube, length of mechanical ventilation and ICU/hospital stay, and hospital mortality were higher in patients with dysphagia (all p < 0.001). The univariate hazard ratio for 90-day mortality for dysphagia was 3.74 (95% CI, 2.01-6.95; p < 0.001). After adjustment for disease severity and length of mechanical ventilation, dysphagia remained an independent predictor for 28-day and 90-day mortality (excess 90-d mortality 9.2%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Dysphagia after extubation was common in ICU patients, sustained until hospital discharge in the majority of affected patients, and was an independent predictor of death. Dysphagia after mechanical ventilation may be an overlooked problem. Studies on underlying causes and therapeutic interventions seem warranted.",

The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19.<h4>Methods</h4>This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2.<h4>Results</h4>The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

We have identified a CE artifact caused by the tissue stain eosin that can complicate the interpretation of CE data. The artifact was detected during routine analysis of a DNA sample isolated from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sample considered histologically suspicious for a B-cell neoplasm. A standard clinical PCR and CE assay for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangement revealed a weak polyclonal population of rearranged IGH genes and a 71 base peak suspicious for IGH clonality. The spectral properties of the 71 base peak were unusual in that although the dominant fluorescence of the peak was blue, it also fluoresced in green and yellow (blue>green>yellow), raising the suspicion that the peak might represent an artifact. CE analysis of the genomic DNA sample without PCR amplification demonstrated the presence of the 71 base peak, suggesting that the artifact was caused by a contaminant within the DNA sample itself. We demonstrate that eosin, which was used to stain the formalin-fixed tissue during processing, yields a discrete 71 base peak of similar morphology to the contaminant peak on CE analysis. The data suggest that eosin in the fixed tissue was not completely eliminated during nucleic acid extraction, resulting in the artifact peak. We discuss the implications of this potentially common contaminant on the interpretation of CE data and demonstrate that artifacts caused by eosin can be avoided by using more stringent DNA purification steps. Histological dyes may fluoresce, and artifacts from them should be considered when primary peaks contain additional underlying peaks of other colors.",

However, its significant impact on the gastrointestinal (GI) system is now well-known. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells <i>via</i> the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is abundantly expressed on lung cells, but also on enterocytes. Several etiopathogenetic mechanisms have been postulated to explain the GI involvement in COVID-19, including loss in intestinal absorption, microscopic mucosal inflammation and impaired ACE-2 function, which plays a significant role in maintaining gut homeostasis. In children the GI manifestations include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, which may represent the earliest presenting symptoms of the disease. However, although rare, a significant GI mucosal inflammation, such as terminal ileitis mimicking an atypical appendicitis, and other GI manifestations have been reported. COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant challenge in healthcare provision in term of ability in providing safe diagnostic procedures, face-to-face consultations, and offering comprehensive care. For instance, changes in health services have raised the risk of empirical or sub-optimal management of chronic GI disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to delayed endoscopic and clinical assessment.

The site-specific risks of multiple primary cancers associated with MCC, which may provide insight into etiologic influences, have not been quantified in large population-based studies. We estimated the long-term risk of subsequent primary tumors after a first primary MCC (1,306 patients) and the risk of second primary MCC following other first primary cancers (2,048,739 patients) within 11 population-based cancer registries which report to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (1986-2002). Patients with first primary MCC were at significantly increased risk of developing a subsequent cancer [standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 1.22; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.01-1.45; observed (O = 122)], with significant excesses restricted to the first year after diagnosis (SIR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.21-2.33; O = 39). Significantly elevated site-specific risks were observed for cancers of salivary gland (SIR, 11.55; 95% CI, 2.32-33.76; O = 3), biliary sites other than liver and gallbladder (SIR, 7.24; 95% CI, 1.46-21.16; O = 3), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.23-4.71; O = 10).

A significantly increased 1.36-fold risk (95% CI, 1.19-1.55; O = 221) of MCC as a second primary malignancy was observed among patients with all other first primary cancers taken together. In particular, significant 3- to 7-fold excesses of MCC followed multiple myeloma (SIR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.01-9.47; O = 4), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR, 6.89; 95% CI, 3.77-11.57; O = 14), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.93-5.47; O = 16), and malignant melanoma (SIR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.74-4.95; O = 16). Although enhanced medical surveillance may play a role, increased reciprocal risks suggest that MCC may share etiologic influences with other malignancies. Heightened awareness of the associations of lymphohematopoietic malignancies with MCC may facilitate early clinical recognition.",

Although LCNEC is categorized among the non-small cell lung cancers, its biological behavior has recently been suggested to be very similar to that of a small cell pulmonary malignancy. The clinical outcome for patients with LCNEC is generally poor, and the optimal treatment for this malignancy has not yet been established. Little information is available regarding management of LCNEC patients with brain metastases (METs). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for patients with brain METs from LCNEC. METHODS The Japanese Leksell Gamma Knife Society planned this retrospective study in which 21 Gamma Knife centers in Japan participated. Data from 101 patients were reviewed for this study. Most of the patients with LCNEC were men (80%), and the mean age was 67 years (range 39-84 years). Primary lung tumors were reported as well controlled in one-third of the patients. More than half of the patients had extracranial METs. Brain metastasis and lung cancer had been detected simultaneously in 25% of the patients. Before GKRS, brain METs had manifested with neurological symptoms in 37 patients. Additionally, prior to GKRS, resection was performed in 17 patients and radiation therapy in 10. A small cell lung carcinoma-based chemotherapy regimen was chosen for 48 patients. The median lesion number was 3 (range 1-33). The median cumulative tumor volume was 3.5 cm<sup>3</sup>, and the median radiation dose was 20.0 Gy. For statistical analysis, the standard Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine post-GKRS survival. Competing risk analysis was applied to estimate GKRS cumulative incidences of maintenance of neurological function and death, local recurrence, appearance of new lesions, and complications. RESULTS The overall median survival time (MST) was 9.6 months. MSTs for patients classified according to the modified recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) system were 25.7, 11.0, and 5.9 months for Class 1+2a (20 patients), Class 2b (28), and Class 3 (46), respectively. At 12 months after GKRS, neurological death-free and deterioration-free survival rates were 93% and 87%, respectively. Follow-up imaging studies were available in 78 patients. The tumor control rate was 86% at 12 months after GKRS. CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that GKRS is an effective treatment for LCNEC patients with brain METs, particularly in terms of maintaining neurological status.",

We assessed inflammatory (im)balance by measuring pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 and anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 during three distinct time periods after sepsis, and assessed its association with mortality.<h4>Design</h4>Prospective observational cohort.<h4>Setting</h4>Two tertiary mixed ICUs in The Netherlands.<h4>Patients</h4>Consecutive patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock from 2011 to 2013.<h4>Interventions</h4>None.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>We repeatedly measured plasma interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 concentrations using cytometric bead array. Poisson regression was used to analyze the relation between inflammatory markers measured on 1) ICU admission and day 4 mortality, 2) day 4 and day 28 mortality, and 3) ICU discharge and 1-year mortality. Secondary outcome was development of ICU-acquired infections. Among 708 patients, 86 (12%) died within 4 days, 140 (20%) died between days 4 and 28, and an additional 155 (22%) died before 1 year. Interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 levels were both independently associated with mortality, but the balance of this response as modelled by an interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 interaction term was not (relative risk, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.04 on admission; relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98-1.06 on day 4; and relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.98-1.29 at ICU discharge). However, inflammatory imbalance on day 4 was associated with development of ICU-acquired infections (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although both interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 productions are associated with death, the balance of these inflammatory mediators does not seem to impact either early, intermediate, or late mortality in patients presenting to the ICU with sepsis.",

The rats were subjected to ozone inhalation at concentrations of 0, 0.12, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 ppm, respectively, for 6 h. After ozone exposure, function indicators, myocardial injury indexes and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in blood were assayed.<h4>Results</h4>High ozone exposure resulted in sustained ventricular tachycardia in male and female rats. Myocardial apoptosis in male rats started from 1.0 ppm ozone, and that in female rats started from 2.0 ppm ozone (p < 0.05). Caspase-9 increased significantly from 0.12 ppm ozone (p < 0.01) in both gender rats, while caspase-3 was initially activated at 0.5 ppm ozone. From 1.0 ppm ozone, mitochondrial cristae and myofilaments dissolved. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decreased significantly from 0.12 ppm and MRCC-IV decreased significantly from 2.0 ppm by ozone.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Acute ozone exposure can cause paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in rats. Moreover, the changes of inflammatory factors in the heart tissues of female and male rats after ozone exposure were greater than those of oxidative stress. This study reported for the first time that 6 h ozone exposure does not cause acute cardiomyocyte necrosis, but promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mitochondrial-dependent manner.

It also includes an assessment of the impact of timeliness of care and multidisciplinary teams on outcome.<h4>Methods</h4>The applicable current medical literature was identified by a computerized search and evaluated using standardized methods. Recommendations were framed using the approach described by the Guidelines Oversight Committee of the American College of Chest Physicians. Data sources included MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.<h4>Results</h4>Initial evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination; CT imaging; pulmonary function tests; and hemoglobin, electrolyte, liver function, and calcium levels. Additional testing for distant metastases and paraneoplastic syndromes should be determined on the basis of these results. Paraneoplastic syndromes may have an adverse impact on cancer treatment, so they should be controlled rapidly with the goal of proceeding with definitive cancer treatment in a timely manner. Although the relationship between timeliness of care and survival is difficult to quantify, efforts to deliver timely care are reasonable and should be balanced with the need to attend to other dimensions of health-care quality (eg, safety, effectiveness, efficiency, equality, consistency with patient values and preferences). Quality care will require multiple disciplines. Although it is difficult to assess the impact, we suggest that a multidisciplinary team approach to care be used, particularly for patients requiring multimodality therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer should include a thorough history and physical examination, pulmonary function tests, CT imaging, basic laboratory tests, and selective testing for distant metastases and paraneoplastic syndromes.",

This unique quasiexperimental setting allowed for better characterization of air pollutant exposure effects because the participants spent most of their time in controlled indoor environments. Concentrations of indoor and outdoor ozone, along with the copollutants particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, were monitored throughout the study period and then combined with time-activity information and filtration conditions of each residence and office to estimate 24-hour and 2-week combined indoor and outdoor mean exposure concentrations. Associations between each exposure measure and outcome measure were analyzed using single-pollutant and 2-pollutant linear mixed models controlling for ambient temperature, secondhand smoke exposure, and personal-level time-varying covariates.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Biomarkers indicative of inflammation and oxidative stress, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, thrombotic factors, and spirometry were measured at 4 sessions.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 89 participants, 25 (28%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 31.5 (7.6) years.

Within this range, in models controlling for a second copollutant and other potential confounders, a 10-ppb increase in 24-hour ozone was associated with mean increases of 36.3% (95% CI, 29.9%-43.0%) in the level of platelet activation marker soluble P-selectin, 2.8% (95% CI, 0.6%-5.1%) in diastolic blood pressure, 18.1% (95% CI, 4.5%-33.5%) in pulmonary inflammation markers fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and 31.0% (95% CI, 0.2%-71.1%) in exhaled breath condensate nitrite and nitrate as well as a -9.5% (95% CI, -17.7% to -1.4%) decrease in arterial stiffness marker augmentation index. A 10-ppb increase in 2-week ozone was associated with increases of 61.1% (95% CI, 37.8%-88.2%) in soluble P-selectin level and 126.2% (95% CI, 12.1%-356.2%) in exhaled breath condensate nitrite and nitrate level. Other measured biomarkers, including spirometry, showed no significant associations with either 24-hour ozone or 2-week ozone exposures.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Short-term ozone exposure at levels not associated with lung function changes was associated with platelet activation and blood pressure increases, suggesting a possible mechanism by which ozone may affect cardiovascular health.",

Despite this, chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain is underrecognised and, consequently, undertreated. It is not represented in the current International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). This article describes the new classification of chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain for ICD-11. Chronic postsurgical or posttraumatic pain is defined as chronic pain that develops or increases in intensity after a surgical procedure or a tissue injury and persists beyond the healing process, ie, at least 3 months after the surgery or tissue trauma. In the classification, it is distinguished between tissue trauma arising from a controlled procedure in the delivery of health care (surgery) and forms of uncontrolled accidental damage (other traumas). In both sections, the most frequent conditions are included. This provides diagnostic codes for chronic pain conditions that persist after the initial tissue trauma has healed and that require specific treatment and management. It is expected that the representation of chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain in ICD-11 furthers identification, diagnosis, and treatment of these pain states. Even more importantly, it will make the diagnosis of chronic posttraumatic or postsurgical pain statistically visible and, it is hoped, stimulate research into these pain syndromes.",

We used the GRADE methodology to aid in moving from evidence to decision making and ultimately to generating final recommendations. Auto-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended in peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALCL-ALK)-negative, NK/T cell (disseminated), enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Auto-HCT in relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and ALCL-ALK-positive lymphomas. Auto-HCT is also recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, and ALCL-ALK-negative lymphomas if not performed as front-line therapy. Auto-HCT in refractory (primary or relapsed) disease is not recommended for any of the histological subtypes discussed. Allo-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended for NK/T cell (disseminated), adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL; acute and lymphoma type), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Allo-HCT for relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, ALCL-ALK-negative, ALCL-ALK-positive, NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), ATLL (acute, lymphoma type, smoldering/chronic), mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (advanced stage IIB-IVB or tumor stage/extracutaneous), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and hepatosplenic lymphoma. Allo-HCT in refractory (primary or relapsed refractory) disease is recommended for any aforementioned histological subtypes. Emerging novel therapies will likely be incorporated into the pretransplantation, peritransplantation, and post-transplantation algorithms (auto-HCT or allo-HCT) with the goals of optimizing efficacy and improving outcomes.

Supplement,"Giant intracranial aneurysms (GIAs) and very large intracranial aneurysms (VLAs) have a poor natural history because of a high incidence of bleeding and strokes. These lesions always represent a great challenge for neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists because of some peculiar intrinsic features such as size, angioarchitecture, wide neck, mass effect, intraluminal thrombosis, atherosclerotic changes, involvement of branches and perforators, and a frequent need to perform revascularization procedures. The results of a cumulative surgical series of 75 VLAs and GIAs are reported. Thirty-three aneurysms were unruptured. Sixty aneurysms underwent direct surgical treatment consisting of 56 direct clippings, 3 trappings w/o revascularization, and 1 wrapping. Fifteen aneurysms were treated by means of extracranial to intracranial (EC-IC) high-flow bypass. An mRS score ranging between 0 and 2 was observed in 54 patients, whereas an mRS of 3 was seen in 5 patients. Four patients had a severe disability (mRS 4-5) and six patients died. Aneurysm's fragmentation, with stacking and seating clips, thrombectomy, and aneurysmorrhaphy were the techniques most frequently employed. Revascularization options involving EC-IC high-flow bypass were used in cases not amenable for direct treatment.

Deep-brain stimulation is a reversible neurosurgical procedure that has been used for the treatment of dystonia, but assessment of its efficacy has been limited to open studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a prospective, controlled, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of bilateral pallidal stimulation in 22 patients with primary generalized dystonia. The severity of dystonia was evaluated before surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively during neurostimulation, with the use of the movement and disability subscores of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Scale (range, 0 to 120 and 0 to 30, respectively, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Movement scores were assessed by a review of videotaped sessions performed by an observer who was unaware of treatment status. At three months, patients underwent a double-blind evaluation in the presence and absence of neurostimulation. We also assessed the patients' quality of life, cognition, and mood at baseline and 12 months.<h4>Results</h4>The dystonia movement score improved from a mean (+/-SD) of 46.3+/-21.3 before surgery to 21.0+/-14.1 at 12 months (P<0.001). The disability score improved from 11.6+/-5.5 before surgery to 6.5+/-4.9 at 12 months (P<0.001). General health and physical functioning were significantly improved at month 12; there were no significant changes in measures of mood and cognition. At the three-month evaluation, dystonia movement scores were significantly better with neurostimulation than without neurostimulation (24.6+/-17.7 vs. 34.6+/-12.3, P<0.001). There were five adverse events (in three patients); all resolved without permanent sequelae.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings support the efficacy and safety of the use of bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus in selected patients with primary generalized dystonia.",

Prosodic perception is based on the decoding of acoustic cues with a predominant function of frequency-related information perceived as speaker's pitch. Evaluation of prosodic meaning is a cognitive function implemented in cortical and subcortical networks that generate continuously updated affective or linguistic speaker impressions. Various brain-imaging methods allow delineation of neural structures involved in prosody processing. In contrast to functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, DC (direct current, slow) components of the EEG directly measure cortical activation without temporal delay. Activation patterns obtained with this method are highly task specific and intraindividually reproducible. Studies presented here investigated the topography of prosodic stimulus processing in dependence on acoustic stimulus structure and linguistic or affective task demands, respectively. Data obtained from measuring DC potentials demonstrated that the right hemisphere has a predominant role in processing emotions from the tone of voice, irrespective of emotional valence. However, right hemisphere involvement is modulated by diverse speech and language-related conditions that are associated with a left hemisphere participation in prosody processing. The degree of left hemisphere involvement depends on several factors such as (i) articulatory demands on the perceiver of prosody (possibly, also the poser), (ii) a relative left hemisphere specialization in processing temporal cues mediating prosodic meaning, and (iii) the propensity of prosody to act on the segment level in order to modulate word or sentence meaning. The specific role of top-down effects in terms of either linguistically or affectively oriented attention on lateralization of stimulus processing is not clear and requires further investigations.",

The primary lesion was in the lungs in 87% of patients, and 1 patient in the breast and 1 in esophagus. Pathological classification of the primary lesion was Grade 2 (MIB-1: 3-20%) in 1 patient and neuroendocrine carcinoma (MIB-1: ≥21%) in 14 patients.

Three males and one female (mean age 65.3 ± 9.4 years) scheduled for cochlear implantation and diagnosed with sporadic VS classified as T1 or T2 (according to Samii) were enrolled in this study. All patients had progressive hearing loss qualifying them for cochlear implantation. First, the tumor was treated using CyberKnife SRS. Next, sequential auditory rehabilitation with a cochlear implant (CI) was performed. Clinical outcomes and surgical feasibility were analyzed, and audiological results were evaluated using pure tone audiometry and speech recognition tests. All patients exhibited open-set speech understanding.

On some farms, (feral) cats and dogs were present. This study provides insight into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive cats and dogs in 10 infected mink farms and their possible role in transmission of the virus. Throat and rectal swabs of 101 cats (12 domestic and 89 feral cats) and 13 dogs of 10 farms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using PCR. Serological assays were performed on serum samples from 62 adult cats and all 13 dogs. Whole Genome Sequencing was performed on one cat sample. Cat-to-mink transmission parameters were estimated using data from all 10 farms. This study shows evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 12 feral cats and 2 dogs. Eleven cats (18%) and two dogs (15%) tested serologically positive. Three feral cats (3%) and one dog (8%) tested PCR-positive. The sequence generated from the cat throat swab clustered with mink sequences from the same farm. The calculated rate of mink-to-cat transmission showed that cats on average had a chance of 12% (95%CI 10%-18%) of becoming infected by mink, assuming no cat-to-cat transmission. As only feral cats were infected it is most likely that infections in cats were initiated by mink, not by humans. Whether both dogs were infected by mink or humans remains inconclusive.

Although the immune system of children is presumed to be stronger and capable of eliminating several infectious agents, it is not applicable to children below the age of 5. Balanced nutrition also plays a vital role in sustaining strong immunity in children of all age groups and so, it could be one of the contributing factors to high susceptibility to co-infectious diseases among children living in poor countries. Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are very common in developing countries.

These stages are reflected in clinical severity and activity classifications, such as Clinical Activity Score and Class 0: No signs or symptoms, 1: Only signs, no symptoms (e. g. lid retraction), 2: Soft tissue involvement, 3: Proptosis, 4: Extraocular muscle involvement, 5: Corneal involvement, 6: Sight loss (NOSPECS). Classifications based on the latter, have important implications in treatment decisions since patients in the early active stage of the disease are more likely to respond to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies, whereas patients in the late fibrotic stage require different therapeutic approaches, including rehabilitative surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed cases of TED investigated with CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in our department. We assessed the findings of imaging studies and their role in the clinical investigation of patients with TED as well as in the differential diagnosis from other disorders.<h4>Results</h4>Imaging has a significant role in the investigation of TED, however a consensus on the use of different imaging modalities in the course of disease has yet to be reached. Nevertheless, imaging and specifically CT and MRI can have a vital role in the initial diagnosis of clinically atypical presentation of TED, in surgical planning, as well as in the differential diagnosis from other orbital disorders.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this review, we attempt to present current trends in imaging investigation of TED. Rather than focusing on the findings of each imaging modality separately, we present the two main imaging modalities focusing on CT and MRI, in the context of pathogenic stages of the disease.",

Bursts repeated at 2-s intervals induced very little LTP; shorter repetition intervals reliably elicited LTP, with the 200-ms repetition interval producing the greatest potentiation. A short-term potentiation effect, which was maximal 20 s after the last burst and decayed within 10 min, was affected differently by the stimulation parameters than was LTP, suggesting that the two phenomena are due to different processes. The results indicate that patterns of stimulation resembling spike discharge patterns of hippocampal neurons in animals in exploratory situations are effective in inducing LTP and suggest temporal constraints on the mechanisms involved in triggering synaptic plasticity.",

However, few clinical data exist regarding community-dwelling women with anorexia nervosa. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalences of common medical findings for these women.<h4>Methods</h4>Cross-sectional, community-based study of 214 women with anorexia nervosa as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Participants were recruited through advertisements and community-based referrals to a study investigating skeletal health in outpatients with anorexia nervosa.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalences of medical findings among the 214 participants were as follows: anemia, 38.6%; leukocytopenia, 34.4%; hyponatremia, 19.7%; hypokalemia, 19.7%; bradycardia, 41.3%; hypotension, 16.1%; hypothermia, 22.4%; elevation of alanine aminotransferase concentration, 12.2%; osteopenia, 51.7%; osteoporosis, 34.6%; and primary amenorrhea, 14.8%. Moreover, 30% of the women reported histories of bone fractures. Except for leukocytopenia (P = .01), bone loss (P = .04), and bradycardia (P = .01), the probability of specific medical findings could not be predicted by the degree of undernutrition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results demonstrate a high prevalence of medical findings in community-dwelling women with anorexia nervosa. Therefore, women with anorexia nervosa should be carefully followed up with regular physical examinations and laboratory assessments. In addition, low weight, particularly in conjunction with the abnormalities reported, should prompt the consideration of a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.",

According to the hypothesis that overweight patients have higher levels of aromatase enzyme availability, we investigated the influence of body mass index (BMI) on the efficacy of adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients in a retrospective analysis of the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) 12 trial.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>ABCSG-12 examined the efficacy of ovarian suppression using goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously every 28 days) in combination with anastrozole or tamoxifen with or without zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. BMI was calculated using the prospectively collected data on patients' height and weight at study entry. BMI categories have been differentiated according to the WHO definition.<h4>Results</h4>Overweight patients treated with anastrozole had a 60% increase in the risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.41; P = .02) and more than a doubling in the risk of death (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.92; P = .01) compared with normal weight patients treated with anastrozole. In the overweight group, patients treated with anastrozole had a nearly 50% increase in the risk of disease recurrence (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.38; P = .08) and a three-fold increase in the risk of death (HR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.35 to 6.82; P = .004) compared with patients treated with tamoxifen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>BMI significantly impacts on the efficacy of anastrozole plus goserelin in premenopausal patients with breast cancer, probably through influencing aromatase availability and/or ovarian suppression by goserelin.",

Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a newer form of rTMS that can be delivered in 3 min, versus 37·5 min for a standard 10 Hz treatment session. We aimed to establish the clinical effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of iTBS compared with standard 10 Hz rTMS in adults with treatment-resistant depression.<h4>Methods</h4>In this randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial, we recruited patients who were referred to specialty neurostimulation centres based at three Canadian university hospitals (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, ON, and University of British Columbia Hospital, Vancouver, BC). Participants were aged 18-65 years, were diagnosed with a current treatment-resistant major depressive episode or could not tolerate at least two antidepressants in the current episode, were receiving stable antidepressant medication doses for at least 4 weeks before baseline, and had an HRSD-17 score of at least 18. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment groups (10 Hz rTMS or iTBS) by use of a random permuted block method, with stratification by site and number of adequate trials in which the antidepressants were unsuccessful. Treatment was delivered open-label but investigators and outcome assessors were masked to treatment groups. Participants were treated with 10 Hz rTMS or iTBS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, administered on 5 days a week for 4-6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) score, with a non-inferiority margin of 2·25 points. For the primary outcome measure, we did a per-protocol analysis of all participants who were randomly allocated to groups and who attained the primary completion point of 4 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01887782.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Sept 3, 2013, and Oct 3, 2016, we randomly allocated 205 participants to receive 10 Hz rTMS and 209 participants to receive iTBS. 192 (94%) participants in the 10 Hz rTMS group and 193 (92%) in the iTBS group were assessed for the primary outcome after 4-6 weeks of treatment. HRSD-17 scores improved from 23·5 (SD 4·4) to 13·4 (7·8) in the 10 Hz rTMS group and from 23·6 (4·3) to 13·4 (7·9) in the iTBS group (adjusted difference  0·103 [corrected], lower 95% CI -1·16; p=0·0011), which indicated non-inferiority of iTBS. Self-rated intensity of pain associated with treatment was greater in the iTBS group than in the 10 Hz rTMS group (mean score on verbal analogue scale 3·8 [SD 2·0] vs 3·4 [2·0] out of 10; p=0·011). Dropout rates did not differ between groups (10 Hz rTMS: 13 [6%] of 205 participants; iTBS: 16 [8%] of 209 participants); p=0·6004). The most common treatment-related adverse event was headache in both groups (10 Hz rTMS: 131 [64%] of 204; iTBS: 136 [65%] of 208).<h4>Interpretation</h4>In patients with treatment-resistant depression, iTBS was non-inferior to 10 Hz rTMS for the treatment of depression. Both treatments had low numbers of dropouts and similar side-effects, safety, and tolerability profiles. By use of iTBS, the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices can be increased several times without compromising clinical effectiveness.<h4>Funding</h4>Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",

Early diagnosis is essential because early treatment may prevent morbidity and may even be life-saving. Definite exclusion, however, needs advanced neuroradiologic diagnostics, which are not readily available in many hospitals. Because measurement of D-dimers has been demonstrated to be helpful in excluding thromboembolic disease, our aim was to investigate whether D-dimers would be also sensitive enough to exclude CST.<h4>Methods</h4>We undertook a prospective multicenter study over a 2.5-year period including all patients who came to the emergency departments with symptoms suggestive of CST. All patients were diagnosed either by magnetic resonance venography, spiral computed tomography scan venography, or intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography. D-dimer levels were measured at admission and analyzed by the same method in all patients.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 343 patients were included. CST was diagnosed in 35 patients, of whom 34 had D-dimers above the cutoff value (>500 microg/L). From the 308 patients not having CST, D-dimers were elevated in 27. Sensitivity of D-dimers was 97.1%, with a negative predictive value of 99.6%. Specificity was 91.2%, with a positive predictive value of 55.7%. D-dimers were positively correlated with the extent of the thrombosis and negatively correlated with the duration of symptoms (Spearman rank correlation coefficients 0.76, -0.58, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>D-dimer measurement is useful in patients with suspected CST. Normal D-dimers make the presence of CST very unlikely.",

Rheumatology,"Primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by sicca and systemic manifestations. In this Review, we summarize the available data on topical and systemic medications, according to clinical signs and disease activity, and we describe the ongoing studies using biologic drugs in the treatment of pSS. Expanding knowledge about the epidemiology, classification criteria, systemic activity scoring (ESSDAI) and patient-reported outcomes (ESSPRI) is driving active research. Treatment decisions are based on the evaluation of symptoms and extraglandular manifestations. Symptomatic treatment is usually appropriate, whereas systemic treatment is reserved for systemic manifestations. Sicca is managed by education, environment modification, elimination of contingent offending drugs, artificial tears, secretagogues and treatments for complications. Mild systemic signs such as fatigue are treated by exercise. Pain can require short-term moderate-dose glucocorticoid therapy and, in some cases, disease-modifying drugs. Severe and acute systemic manifestations indicate treatment with glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressant drugs. The role for biologic agents is promising, but no double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) proving the efficacy of these drugs are available. Targets for new treatments directed against the immunopathological mechanisms of pSS include epithelial cells, T cells, B-cell overactivity, the interferon signature, proinflammatory cytokines, ectopic germinal centre formation, chemokines involved in lymphoid cell homing, and epigenetic modifications.",

Mild elevation of transaminase may be observed in anorexia nervosa, but acute liver injury is uncommon. A complex programmed cell death in response to starvation, called autophagy, has been described in experimental and human studies. Case Presentation. A 24-year-old woman suffering from anorexia nervosa was hospitalized for severe malnutrition. At admission, there were biological signs of acute liver injury but no electrolytic imbalance. After having ruled out the most common causes of liver injury, the patient was carefully refed. As liver tests remained abnormal, liver biopsy was performed. At histology and electron microscopy, numerous signs suggestive of starvation-induced hepatocyte autophagy were found. Discussion. Severe starvation can be associated with acute liver injury that is slowly reversible with careful enteral nutrition. In this clinical situation, profound hepatic glycogen depletion in association with autophagy appears as the leading cause of liver injury.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/crihep/2013/749169.pdf

Therefore, the management of brain metastases in these patients has mirrored that of SCLC through the use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to look at predictors of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and any potential differences in outcomes for patients with brain metastases from LCNEC.<h4>Material and methods</h4>We queried the NCDB from 2004 to 2015 for patients with LCNEC of the lung with brain metastases that received brain radiation. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of SRS use and overall survival (OS). Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios for survival were used to account for indication bias.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 9970 patients with LCNEC of the lung we identified 348 with brain metastases. Sixty-eight patients were treated with upfront SRS and 280 were treated with WBRT. Patients that were treated at an academic facility or received chemotherapy as part of upfront treatment were more likely to receive SRS. Univariable analysis revealed improved outcomes with SRS compared to WBRT, with a median OS of 11 months compared to 6 months, respectively (p = .007). Multivariable Cox regression with propensity score confirmed SRS to have improved survival (HR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.51-0.91, p = .0093). Multivariable Cox regression with propensity score also identified younger age, receipt of chemotherapy, absence of extracranial disease and non-rural locations as additional predictors of improved OS.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment of brain metastases from LCNEC of the lung with SRS was associated with improved survival. For the appropriate patients, upfront treatment of limited brain metastases with SRS may be appropriate.",

These conditions often improve following immunomodulatory therapies. However, the proportions of the different syndromes, the numbers with associated tumours and the relationships with potassium channel subunit antibody specificities have been unclear. We documented the clinical phenotype and tumour associations in 96 potassium channel antibody positive patients (titres >400 pM). Five had thymomas and one had an endometrial adenocarcinoma. To define the antibody specificities, we looked for binding of serum antibodies and their effects on potassium channel currents using human embryonic kidney cells expressing the potassium channel subunits. Surprisingly, only three of the patients had antibodies directed against the potassium channel subunits. By contrast, we found antibodies to three proteins that are complexed with (125)I-alpha-dendrotoxin-labelled potassium channels in brain extracts: (i) contactin-associated protein-2 that is localized at the juxtaparanodes in myelinated axons; (ii) leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 protein that is most strongly expressed in the hippocampus; and (iii) Tag-1/contactin-2 that associates with contactin-associated protein-2. Antibodies to Kv1 subunits were found in three sera, to contactin-associated protein-2 in 19 sera, to leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 protein in 55 sera and to contactin-2 in five sera, four of which were also positive for the other antibodies. The remaining 18 sera were negative for potassium channel subunits and associated proteins by the methods employed. Of the 19 patients with contactin-associated protein-antibody-2, 10 had neuromyotonia or Morvan's syndrome, compared with only 3 of the 55 leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 protein-antibody positive patients (P < 0.0001), who predominantly had limbic encephalitis. The responses to immunomodulatory therapies, defined by changes in modified Rankin scores, were good except in the patients with tumours, who all had contactin-associated-2 protein antibodies. This study confirms that the majority of patients with high potassium channel antibodies have limbic encephalitis without tumours. The identification of leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 protein and contactin-associated protein-2 as the major targets of potassium channel antibodies, and their associations with different clinical features, begins to explain the diversity of these syndromes; furthermore, detection of contactin-associated protein-2 antibodies should help identify the risk of an underlying tumour and a poor prognosis in future patients.",https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-pdf/133/9/2734/16697467/awq213.pdf

We investigated the infants' home environments using bioaerosol sampling methods, with specific attention to S atra. Air and surface samples were collected from the room where the infant was reported to have spent the most time.<h4>Results</h4>Mean colony counts for all fungi averaged 29 227 colony-forming units (CFU)/m3 in homes of patients and 707 CFU/m3 in homes of controls. The mean concentration of S atra in the air was 43 CFU/m3 in homes of patients and 4 CFU/m3 in homes of controls. Viable S atra was detected in filter cassette samples of the air in the homes of 5 of 9 patients and 4 of 27 controls. The matched odds ratio for a change of 10 units in the mean concentration of S atra in the air was 9.83 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3 X 10(6)). The mean concentration of S atra on surfaces was 20 X 10(6) CFU/g and 0.007 x 10(6) CFU/g in homes of patients and controls, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Infants with pulmonary hemorrhage and hemosiderosis were more likely than controls to live in homes with toxigenic S atra and other fungi in the indoor air.",

Demographics, associated factors, and visual function at presentation and follow-up were collected. Patients were divided into two groups based on sex for statistical comparisons.<h4>Results</h4>We included 721 consecutive patients, including 66 men (9%) and 655 women (91%). Men were more likely to have sleep apnea (24% vs 4%, p < 0.001) and were older (37 vs 28 years, p = 0.02). As their first symptom of IIH, men were less likely to report headache (55% vs 75%, p < 0.001) but more likely to report visual disturbances (35% vs 20%, p = 0.005). Men continued to have less headache (79% vs 89%, p = 0.01) at initial neuro-ophthalmologic assessment. Visual acuity and visual fields at presentation and last follow-up were significantly worse among men. The relative risk of severe visual loss for men compared with women was 2.1 (95% CI 1.4-3.3, p = 0.002) for at least one eye and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-3.7, p = 0.03) for both eyes. Logistic regression supported sex as an independent risk factor for severe visual loss.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Men with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are twice as likely as women to develop severe visual loss. Men and women have different symptom profiles, which could represent differences in symptom expression or symptom thresholds between the sexes. Men with IIH likely need to be followed more closely regarding visual function because they may not reliably experience or report other symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.",

We have previously shown a secondary calpain-3 defect to be associated with TMD, which further underscored that titin is the candidate. We now report the first mutations in TTN to cause a human skeletal-muscle disease, TMD. In Mex6, the last exon of TTN, a unique 11-bp deletion/insertion mutation, changing four amino acid residues, completely cosegregated with all tested 81 Finnish patients with TMD in 12 unrelated families. The mutation was not found in 216 Finnish control samples. In a French family with TMD, a Leu-->Pro mutation at position 293,357 in Mex6 was discovered. Mex6 is adjacent to the known calpain-3 binding site Mex5 of M-line titin. Immunohistochemical analysis using two exon-specific antibodies directed to the M-line region of titin demonstrated the specific loss of carboxy-terminal titin epitopes in the TMD muscle samples that we studied, thus implicating a functional defect of the M-line titin in the genesis of the TMD disease phenotype.",

They share several clinical and morphologic features including their blue tinctorial properties, the presence of a dermal proliferation of spindle, fusiform or ovoid cells, associated melanin pigment (both within the melanocytic tumor cells and also within macrophages) and stromal sclerosis and, at least focal positivity for HMB-45 (Gp100). Some variants, such as deep penetrating nevus, often show considerable variation in nuclear size and shape, and, as a consequence, are at risk of being misdiagnosed as melanoma by those unfamiliar with their characteristic morphologic features. The so-called malignant blue nevus is a controversial term denoting melanomas arising in association with or exhibiting some morphologic similarities to blue nevus. There are also lesions that are probably related to blue nevi, such as the recently described pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma and the neurocristic hamartomas, whose nature, biologic behavior, and relationship to the better established entities remains to be clearly established. This review aims to present a brief overview of these lesions, highlighting their pathologic characteristics, distinguishing features and potential diagnostic pitfalls, with particular emphasis on recently described entities, molecular findings, controversial areas, and approaches to diagnosis.",

Data on clinical laboratory tests, health status, liver function, vital signs, and examinations were collected (DRKS-ID: DRKS00017068). Mortality rates 28 and 90 days after the first ADVOS treatment, adverse events and ADVOS treatment parameters, including treatment abortions, were documented.This analysis was performed 2 years after the first patient was included on January 18, 2017. As of February 20, 2019, 4 clinical sites in Germany participated and enrolled 118 patients with a median age of 60 (IQR: 45, 69) of whom 70 were male (59.3%). Patients had a median SOFA Score of 14 (IQR: 11, 16) and a predicted mortality of 80%. The median number of failing organs was 3 (IQR: 2, 4).Four hundred twenty nine ADVOS treatments sessions were performed with a median duration of 17 hours (IQR: 6, 23). A 5.8% of the ADVOS sessions (25 of 429) were aborted due to device related errors, while 14.5% (62 of 429) were stopped for other reasons. Seventy nine adverse events were documented, 13 of them device related (all clotting, and all recovered without sequels).A significant reduction in serum creatinine (1.5 vs 1.2 mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen (24 vs 17 mg/dl) and bilirubin (6.9 vs 6.5 mg/dl) was observed following the first ADVOS treatment session. Blood pH, bicarbonate (HCO3-) and base excess returned to the physiological range, while partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) remained unchanged. At the time of the analysis, 28- and 90-day mortality were 60% and 65%, respectively, compared to an expected ICU-mortality rate of 80%. SOFA score was an independent predictor for outcome in a multivariable logistic regression analysis.The reported data show a high quality and completion of all participating centers. Data interpretation must be cautious due to the small number of patients, and the nature of the registry, without a control group. However, the data presented here show an improvement of expected mortality rates. Minor clotting events similar to other dialysis therapies occurred during the treatments.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7899840?pdf=render

We report the validation of a qualitative indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) test for the detection of anti-NMDAR IgG and describe the attributes of antibody-positive patients.<h4>Methods</h4>The anti-NMDAR IgG assay (Euroimmun Diagnosika, Lübeck, Germany) was validated with serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 30 healthy and 50 disease controls as well as 5 anti-NMDAR IgG-positive individuals. Consecutive specimens (n=1671) for anti-NMDAR IgG antibodies were evaluated and positive specimens titrated to end-point [starting dilutions: CSF; 1:1 and serum; 1:10]. In a subset of antibody-positive patients, we sought clinical information for correlation with diagnostic and treatment outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>The assay demonstrated excellent performance characteristics in all groups evaluated. Of the 1671 specimens tested, 1389 were unique cases with a positivity rate of 9.0% (n=123). For the antibody-positive samples, the female to male ratio was 2:1 with a prevalence of 46% in the pediatric population (≤17 years). Antibody titers were titrated to end-point for 106/123 specimens [45 CSF, 41 sera, and 20 CSF and serum pairs] with more than 75% having titers greater than 1:10 (CSF) and 1:20 (serum). Overall, high levels of these antibodies showed correlation to disease severity with variable response to treatment in the subset of patients evaluated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data suggests a high prevalence for anti-NMDAR antibody encephalitis irrespective of age and gender in our unselected disease cohort with support for measuring antibody titers in the evaluation of these patients.",

In this case report, we emphasize its diagnosis and summarize the various treatment options available for bilateral posterior fracture-dislocation of shoulders and also its management in conjunction with cavernous sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT).<h4>Case report</h4>A 29-year-old gentleman had bilateral posterior fracture-dislocation of shoulders, with comminuted three-part fractures of both humeral heads, after two episodes of seizures, following CSVT. Unlike posterior fracture-dislocation secondary to any other causes, patients with CSVT are usually intensive care unit bound and have low Glasgow coma scale, in a state of inability to complain, causing a delay in diagnosis and chances of delay in treatment due to the concomitant treatment of CSVT. This patient was treated in coordination with the neurologists and operated by bilateral open reduction and internal fixation using proximal humerus locking plates and greater tuberosity reconstruction. 2 years post-operatively, the patient had painless shoulders, with satisfactory and functional range of motion.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Bilateral shoulder screening using computed tomography scan is helpful for diagnosing bilateral shoulder posterior fracture-dislocation, which can be easily missed in patients presenting with Triple E pathologies.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) account for around 1% of all adult cancers. Till date, more than 50 histologic subtypes have been identified. Adipocyte sarcoma or liposarcoma (LPS) is one of the most common STS subtypes, accounting for 15% of all sarcomas, with an incidence of 24% of all extremity STSs and 45% of all retroperitoneal STSs. The new World Health Organization classification system has divided LPS into four different subgroups: atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated LPS, dedifferentiated LPS, myxoid LPS, and pleomorphic LPS. These lesions can develop at any location and exhibit different aggressive potentials reflecting their morphologic diversity and clinical behavior. Patients affected by LPS should be managed in specialized multidisciplinary cancer centers. Whereas surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for localized disease, the benefits of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy are still unclear. Systemic treatment, particularly chemotherapy, is still limited in metastatic disease. Despite the efforts toward a better understanding of the biology of LPS, the outcome of advanced and metastatic patients remains poor. The advent of targeted therapies may lead to an improvement of treatment options and clinical outcomes.

Fifty-eight cases of Lemierre's syndrome were reported in previously healthy persons, with an incidence of 14.4 cases per million per year in youngsters aged 15-24 years old. There was no increase during the study period. Lemierre's syndrome originating from an oropharyngeal infection was seen in 37 youngsters. An otogenic variant of Lemierre's syndrome was seen in 5 children with dissemination to nearby regions, and other variants of Lemierre's syndrome, e.g. from the sinuses and teeth, were seen in 16 adults. Patients often had metastatic infections already on admission and needed prolonged hospitalisation. The overall mortality of Lemierre's syndrome was 9%. Forty-two elderly patients had disseminated F. necrophorum infections originating from foci in lower parts of the body. They frequently had predisposing diseases, e.g. abdominal or urogenital cancers, which contributed to the high mortality of 26%. This study shows that the incidence of Lemierre's syndrome is higher than that previously found and has a characteristic age distribution. Early suspicion of the diagnosis, several weeks of antibiotic therapy, often combined with surgical drainage, is mandatory to lower the mortality.

Based on the most recent evidence, migraine and fibromyalgia are two conditions with the most favorable outcomes after acupuncture. At the same time, abdominal pain has the least evidence for the use of acupuncture. Acupuncture is efficacious for reducing pain in patients with LBP, and for short-term pain relief for those with neck pain. Further research needs to be done to evaluate acupuncture's efficacy in these conditions, especially for abdominal pain, as many of the current studies have a risk of bias due to lack of blinding and small sample size.",

Brain aneurysms have a frequency ranging from 5 to 11 %. A successful surgery requires knowledge of the anatomic region and the aneurysm. The objective was to show the surgical management of paraclinoid aneurysms.<h4>Methods</h4>From January 2009 to January 2015, we carried out a retrospective study in the Neurosurgery Department at Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI. We included 66 patients with the diagnosis of paraclinoid aneurysm. We obtained the clinical characteristics, evolution, complications, and outcomes from the clinical and radiological records.<h4>Results</h4>61 patients (92.4 %) were female; 65 underwent neurosurgical clipping, and one underwent cerebral bypass surgery with exclusion of the aneurysm. Forty six patients presented subarachnoid hemorrhage due to aneurysmal rupture. By reason of their location, 35 paraclinoid aneurysms (53 %) were superior, 20 medial (30.3 %) and 4 inferior (6 %). Thirty three patients had small aneurysms, 23 large aneurysms, and 10 patients presented giant aneurysms. After surgery, 51 patients had good results, since they scored 4 and 5 in the Glasgow Outcome Score. Three patients presented amaurosis as a surgery-related complication.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Microsurgical management is still the best treatment for these aneurysms, due to its ability to exclude them entirely; besides, is the best method to decompress the optic nerve.",

TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomere protein titin, has been insufficiently analyzed for cardiomyopathy mutations because of its enormous size.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed TTN in 312 subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy, 231 subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 249 controls by using next-generation or dideoxy sequencing. We evaluated deleterious variants for cosegregation in families and assessed clinical characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 72 unique mutations (25 nonsense, 23 frameshift, 23 splicing, and 1 large tandem insertion) that altered full-length titin. Among subjects studied by means of next-generation sequencing, the frequency of TTN mutations was significantly higher among subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy (54 of 203 [27%]) than among subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3 of 231 [1%], P=3×10(-16)) or controls (7 of 249 [3%], P=9×10(-14)). TTN mutations cosegregated with dilated cardiomyopathy in families (combined lod score, 11.1) with high (>95%) observed penetrance after the age of 40 years. Mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy were overrepresented in the titin A-band but were absent from the Z-disk and M-band regions of titin (P≤0.01 for all comparisons). Overall, the rates of cardiac outcomes were similar in subjects with and those without TTN mutations, but adverse events occurred earlier in male mutation carriers than in female carriers (P=4×10(-5)).<h4>Conclusions</h4>TTN truncating mutations are a common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, occurring in approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and in 18% of sporadic cases. Incorporation of sequencing approaches that detect TTN truncations into genetic testing for dilated cardiomyopathy should substantially increase test sensitivity, thereby allowing earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Defining the functional effects of TTN truncating mutations should improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy.

PEM was among the first established examples of an intermediate class of melanocytic tumors, including atypical Spitz tumors, with frequent metastasis to lymph nodes but only rare extranodal spread. Sporadic and CC-associated PEM are essentially histologically indistinguishable. A subset of PEM shows loss of cytoplasmic expression of the protein kinase A regulatory subunit alpha (PRKAR1A), a tumor suppressor gene mutated in 70% of families with CC. However, molecular studies of such tumors have been limited. Therefore, we used next-generation sequencing to assess 480 cancer-related genes and performed PrkaR1α immunohistochemistry on 13 cases morphologically consistent with PEM. Six cases demonstrated loss of PrkaR1α expression by immunohistochemistry. Three cases were ""combined"" PEM arising in association with a common nevus. These lesions harbored PRKAR1A genetic alterations in addition to BRAF mutations. Three ""pure"" PEM, not associated with a common nevus, showed no evidence of PRKAR1A genetic alterations despite loss of PrkaR1α expression. Two of these PEM demonstrated MAP2K1 in frame deletions. PrkaR1α protein expression was preserved in 7 cases. Two of these lesions revealed fusions of the gene encoding the protein kinase C alpha isoform (PRKCA) to 2 distinct partners (ATP2B4-PRKCA and RNF13-PRKCA). Two lesions may represent misdiagnosed ""blue nevus with epithelioid features"" as they demonstrated GNAQ hotspot mutations. A conceivable explanation, but one we do not favor is that rare PEM are caused by GNAQ mutations. No genetic aberrations were detected in 3 lesions. None of our 13 cases demonstrated TERT alterations or significant chromosomal copy number changes. These results further validate the concept of PEM as a distinctive intermediate/borderline melanocytic tumor, and also illustrate its molecular heterogeneity.",

Here, we report a phase 2 study of a novel nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation strategy tailored for this patient population. This study has completed the enrollment, and 35 patients (13 MF, 22 SS) have undergone transplant as planned. The majority (80%) of the patients had stage IV disease and received multiple previous systemic therapies. All patients had active disease at the time of conditioning using total skin electron beam therapy, total lymphoid irradiation, and antithymocyte globulin, and received allograft infusion as outpatients. Cyclosporine or tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients tolerated the transplant well, with 1- and 2-year nonrelapse mortality of 3% and 14%, respectively. The day +180 cumulative incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD was 16%, and the 2-year incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 32%. With a median posttransplant follow-up of 5.4 years, the 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 68%, 62%, and 56%. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor for minimal residual disease monitoring, we observed that 43% achieved molecular remission, which was associated with a lower incidence of disease progression or relapse (9% vs 87%; P = .02). Our study also showed that patients who were aged ≥65 years at the time of allotransplant had similar clinical outcomes compared with younger patients. Thus, we have developed an alternative and potentially curative nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant regimen for patients with advanced stage MF/SS.

All pathologic sections were reevaluated for histologic differentiation variations (squamous and glandular). The clinicopathological variables of patients were reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 687 UTUC patients in our study, 53 (7.7 %) had squamous differentiation, 20 (2.9 %) had glandular differentiation and 8 (1.2 %) had both histologic variants. Patients with mixed histologic variant tended to have significant larger percentage of sessile tumor architecture (58.0 vs 18.2 %), presence of CIS (7.4 vs 2.3 %), advanced T stage, advanced tumor grade and lymph node metastasis (17.3 vs 6.6 %; all p < 0.05). Patients with squamous and/or glandular differentiation had significant worse cancer-specific survival than pure UTUC patients (p < 0.001), while significant difference of recurrence-free survival between two groups was not observed (p = 0.126). Patients with both squamous and glandular differentiation did not show significantly worse CSS than those with single histologic variant. Univariate analyses revealed that tumor squamous and/or glandular differentiation was a significant factor on survival (p < 0.001). However, the influence did not remain significant after adjusted for other factors in the multivariate analyses (p = 0.076, HR 1.42).<h4>Conclusions</h4>UTUC patients with squamous and/or glandular differentiation are more likely to have aggressive tumor biological features and tend to have worse postoperative outcomes.",

Despite significant efficacy, one of the major limitations of these targeted agents is presence of primary or acquired resistance to these novel drugs. Patients who fail primary therapy especially with ibrutinib have poor outcomes and may respond poorly to subsequent therapies. Hence, it is important to understand resistance mechanisms a priori to identify patients who are unlikely to respond, and to explore alternative therapeutic strategies. In this review, we will discuss the currently most active two drugs: ibrutinib and venetoclax, both of which have shown high response rates in R/R MCL.

There is a broad spectrum of disease manifestations with some subtypes commonly showing skin lesions, while in others, the skin is rarely involved. Here, we describe cutaneous manifestations of histiocytoses belonging to the Langerhans group (L group), the group of cutaneous and mucocutaneous histiocytoses (C group) and the group of Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) and related histiocytoses (R group) according to the current classification. Characteristic clinical presentations noted were a rust-brown colour or xanthomatous aspect in many cases of histiocytoses. Histological criteria for differentiation are described. Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for S100 and CD1a in Langerhans-cell histiocytoses (LHCH) of the L group, while CD68 positivity with S100 and CD1a negativity are typical in histiocytoses of the C group of cutaneous and mucocutaneous histiocytoses. RDD in the R group shows positivity for S100 and CD68, while CD1a is negative. We further review the pathogenesis of LHCH based on insights on the central role of the mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinase pathway. Common mutations in various histiocytic populations of diverse ontogeny and at different stages of differentiation may be responsible for the diverse clinical picture of this neoplastic entity. For histiocytoses of the C group and R group, a reactive origin is discussed with the exception of the disseminated form of juvenile xanthogranuloma. We suggest exploring the role of an origin from skin residing histiocytes for the isolated cutaneous manifestation in some types. With regard to therapeutic options, skin-directed therapies are the first choice in limited disease, while systemic chemotherapy has traditionally been used in extensive disease. In Langerhans-cell histiocytoses and related entities, therapy by BRAF inhibition has led to a breakthrough especially in patients with an activation of the MAPK pathway.",

Considering the tumor-promoting implications of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) signaling, this study aimed to assess uPAR expression in the plasma-derived EVs of patients with metastatic melanoma to determine its potential correlation with clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Blood samples from 71 patients with metastatic melanoma were collected before initiating immunotherapy. Tumor-derived and immune cell-derived EVs were isolated and analyzed to assess the relative percentage of uPAR<sup>+</sup> EVs. The associations between uPAR and clinical outcomes, sex, BRAF status, baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels and number of metastatic sites were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Responders had a significantly lower percentage of tumor-derived, dendritic cell (DC)-derived and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-derived uPAR +EVs at baseline than non-responders. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the uPAR<sup>+</sup>EV quartiles indicated that higher levels of melanoma-derived uPAR<sup>+</sup> EVs were strongly correlated with poorer progression-free survival (p<0.0001) and overall survival (p<0.0001). We also found a statistically significant correlation between lower levels of uPAR<sup>+</sup> EVs from both CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and DCs and better survival.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results indicate that higher levels of tumor-derived, DC-derived and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-derived uPAR<sup>+</sup> EVs in non-responders may represent a new biomarker of innate resistance to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors.

Although several cases of cats and dogs infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported during this outbreak, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in dog and its transmission among other companion animals are still unknown. Here, we report an extensive serological study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs in Wuhan and analyse the infection rates at different stages of the pandemic outbreak. A total of 946 dogs serum samples were collected from Wuhan, of which 36 samples were obtained prior to the pandemic outbreak. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that 16 sera collected during the outbreak were detected as positive through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Of these 16 sera, 10 exhibited measurable SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies whose titres ranged from 1/20 to 1/180. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between SARS-CoV-2 and canine coronavirus (CCV). Furthermore, with the effective control of the outbreak, a decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 seropositive dog number was observed. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has infected companion dogs during the outbreak, and that COVID-19 patient families have a higher risk of dog infection.

Clinical activity and safety of brentuximab vedotin, a CD30 targeting antibody-drug conjugate, was evaluated in MF and SS. Tissue and blood biomarkers of clinical response were explored.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>In this phase II study, patients with MF or SS with negligible to 100% CD30 expression levels were treated with brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for a maximum of sixteen doses. The primary end point was overall global response rate. Secondary end points included correlation of tissue CD30 expression level with clinical response, time to response, duration of response, progression-free and event-free survivals, and safety.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 32 patients enrolled and treated, 30 patients had available efficacy evaluations. Objective global response was observed in 21 (70%) of 30 patients (90% CI, 53% to 83%). CD30 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry was highly variable, with a median CD30max of 13% (range, 0% to 100%). Those with <5% CD30 expression had a lower likelihood of global response than did those with 5% or greater CD30 expression (P < .005). CD163 positive tumor-associated macrophages, many of which coexpress CD30, were abundant in tissue. Peripheral neuropathy was the most common adverse event.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Brentuximab vedotin demonstrated significant clinical activity in treatment-refractory or advanced MF or SS with a wide range of CD30 expression levels. Additional biomarker studies may help optimize rational design of combination therapies with brentuximab vedotin.",

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a blood purification technique used to treat the most severe forms of AKI. The optimal time to initiate RRT so as to improve clinical outcomes remains uncertain.This review complements another Cochrane review by the same authors: Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effects of different timing (early and standard) of RRT initiation on death and recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with AKI.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 23 August 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched LILACS to 11 September 2017.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included all patients with AKI in ICU regardless of age, comparing early versus standard RRT initiation. For safety and cost outcomes we planned to include cohort studies and non-RCTs.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Data were extracted independently by two authors. The random-effects model was used and results were reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Main results</h4>We included five studies enrolling 1084 participants. Overall, most domains were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to standard treatment, early initiation may reduce the risk of death at day 30, although the 95% CI does not rule out an increased risk (5 studies, 1084 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13; I<sup>2</sup> = 52%; low certainty evidence); and probably reduces the death after 30 days post randomisation (4 studies, 1056 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.10; I<sup>2</sup>= 29%; moderate certainty evidence); however in both results the CIs included a reduction and an increase of death. Earlier start may reduce the risk of death or non-recovery kidney function (5 studies, 1076 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; I<sup>2</sup>= 54%; low certainty evidence). Early strategy may increase the number of patients who were free of RRT after RRT discontinuation (5 studies, 1084 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.40; I<sup>2</sup>= 58%; low certainty evidence) and probably slightly increases the recovery of kidney function among survivors who discontinued RRT after day 30 (5 studies, 572 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06; I<sup>2</sup>= 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to standard; however the lower limit of CI includes the null effect. Early RRT initiation increased the number of patients who experienced adverse events (4 studies, 899 participants: RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; high certainty evidence). Compared to standard, earlier RRT start may reduce the number of days in ICU (4 studies, 1056 participants: MD -1.78 days, 95% CI -3.70 to 0.13; I<sup>2</sup> = 90%; low certainty evidence), but the CI included benefit and harm.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Based mainly on low quality of evidence identified, early RRT may reduce the risk of death and may improve the recovery of kidney function in critically patients with AKI, however the 95% CI indicates that early RRT might worsen these outcomes. There was an increased risk of adverse events with early RRT. Further adequate-powered RCTs using appropriate criteria to define the optimal time of RRT are needed to reduce the imprecision of the results.",

Our study highlights the prominent similarity between Spitzoid and conventional melanomas with similar copy number changes and high and equal numbers of ultraviolet-induced coding mutations affecting similar driver genes. Mutations in MEN1, PRKAR1A, and DNMT3A in Spitzoid melanomas may indicate involvement of the protein kinase A pathway, or a role of DNA methylation in the disease. Other than activating HRAS variants, there were few additional mutations in Spitz nevi, and few copy number changes other than 11p amplification and chromosome 9 deletions. Similarly, there were no large-scale copy number alterations and few somatic alterations other than activating BRAF or NRAS mutations in conventional nevi. A presumed melanoma driver mutation (IDH1<sup>Arg132Cys</sup>) was revealed in one of the benign nevi.

After a successful and uneventful septorhinoplasty, she required numerous hospital admissions due to multiple episodes of blunt nasal trauma, culminating in clear nasal discharge and neurological symptoms, including dizziness, right-sided paresthesia and difficulty walking. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was ruled out by CT brain; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord showed demyelinating areas in the brain and cervical region of the spinal cord. CSF examination revealed the presence of oligoclonal bands. A neurologist confirmed the diagnosis of MS and initiated treatment, which was well tolerated. The patient is in remission with mild paresthesia in the right hand. Despite the repeated nasal trauma, the septorhinoplasty procedure had an excellent outcome. In conclusion, repeated nasal trauma, especially in the early postoperative period, in addition to procedure failure, may also point to the presence of an uncommon underlying neurological disorder, hitherto undiagnosed. It is therefore important to have an open mind when it comes to the differential diagnosis in such unusual scenarios.

Its histogenesis has not been elucidated and ultrastructural features have not been described in human beings. We present an additional case of ATM in a 28-year-old woman with positive sentinel node biopsy and provide the results of electron microscopic studies. Histopathologically, the skin lesion was composed of heavily pigmented neoplastic cells mostly arranged as large sheets, focally also in a nodular growth pattern. After bleaching, the neoplastic cells demonstrated round nuclei with 1 or rarely 2 conspicuous nucleoli and a prominent nuclear membrane and abundant, gray, slate-like cytoplasm. Some cells demonstrated round cytoplasmic inclusions. There was no nuclear pleomorphism, and only a few mitotic figures could be found after extensive search. Multiple areas of necrosis en masse of tumor cells were seen. The lymph node biopsy revealed a complete effacement of the lymph node architecture by the extensive proliferation of hyperpigmented cells in the parenchyma. Immunohistochemically, the same pattern of staining was seen on the bleached and unbleached slides both in the skin and in the lymph node. The neoplastic cells stained positively with MiTF (nuclei), NSE, NKI/C3, tyrosinase (weak), p53, and CD68. S-100 protein, HMB45, Melan A, Mac367, and lysozyme reacted negatively. Occasional cells (<1%) reacted with MIB-1. Ultra-structural studies revealed that the neoplastic cells possessed a large, indented nucleus with a prominent nuclear membrane, a single (para) centrally located nucleolus, and peripherally marginated chromatin. The cytoplasm was abundant and contained numerous single melanosomes and rare compound melanosomes. The melanosomes were in stages II to IV of maturation, with a marked predominance of stage II and stage III melanosomes. There was a high number of aberrant melanosomes with a wide variety of configurations. Melanophages were a minor component of the lesion. Our ultrastructural studies provide unequivocal evidence that ATM is a neoplasm of melanosome-producing cells. We also review the literature on ATM.",

The presence of neutralizing antibodies within the first weeks from symptoms onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p = 0.002), while the lack of neutralizing capacity correlates with an increased risk of a fatal outcome (p = 0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities, with IgG to spike antigens providing the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporarily boosted, and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression.

The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

Using a large data set, we evaluated the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in samples submitted for respiratory testing from mid-February to mid-April 2020.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR was developed and validated. A subset of canine and feline samples submitted for respiratory pathogen panel testing to reference laboratories in Asia, Europe, and North America were also tested for SARS-CoV-2. The frequency of respiratory pathogens was compared for the February-April period of 2020 and 2019.<h4>Results</h4>Samples from 4616 patients were included in the study and 44% of canine and 69% of feline samples were PCR positive with Mycoplasma cynos and Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma felis and feline calicivirus, respectively. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified. Positive results for respiratory samples were similar between years.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>The data in this study suggest that during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in early 2020, respiratory diseases in tested pet cats and dogs were caused by common veterinary pathogens and that SARS-CoV-2 infections in dogs and cats are rare.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jsap.13300

Patients with del(7q) or -7 had similar demographic and disease-related characteristics. Somatic mutations were detected in 79% (93/117) of patients (82% in -7 and 73% in del(7q) group). Median number of mutations per patient was 2 (range 0-8). There was no difference in mutation frequency between the two groups. Patients harbouring ≥2 mutations had a worse outcome than patients with <2 or no mutations (leukaemic transformation at 24 months, 38% and 20%, respectively, p = 0.044). Untreated patients with del(7q) had better overall survival (OS) compared with -7 (median OS, 34 vs 17 months, p = 0.034). In multivariable analysis, blast count, TP53 mutations and number of mutations were independent predictors of OS, whereas the cytogenetic subgroups did not retain prognostic relevance.

The patient was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation of hepatic tumors incidentally discovered at another hospital. Various diagnostic methods, including ultrasonography (US), computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hepatic angiography displayed three small lesions in the liver with outstanding findings consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Surgical resection was performed and the three lesions were microscopically diagnosed as RLH of the liver. The lesions comprised a massive infiltration of lymphoid cells with follicles and hyalinized inter-follicular spaces. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that infiltrating lymphocytes had no prominent nuclear atypia and polyclonality. RLH of the liver is a very rare condition and only twelve cases have been reported in the English literature. Majority of the reported cases were middle-aged women and about half of them had some immunologic abnormalities such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Sjogren's syndrome, primary immunodeficiency, primary biliary cirrhosis. Since they are often clinically misdiagnosed as HCC, surgery is the choice of treatment for these patients. Although their pathology resembles malignant lymphoma, the clinical course is completely benign. The authors propose that RLH of the liver can be discriminated from HCC by its clinical features.",

Conditions requiring radiotherapy of the head may include head, neck, or brain tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>The study examines the effect of ionizing radiation on cochlear implant function. The implanted devices examined were the Nucleus CI24M and Nucleus CI24R(CS). In a modeled study, two implants of each type were treated with fraction schemes most frequently used in clinical routine (e.g., conventional fractionation [total dose, 120 Gy] and hyperfractionation [total dose, 116 Gy]). Parameters quantified were the implant output amplitude changes at high and low current level (current levels 255 and 100, respectively), the charge balance of the biphasic pulse, and the accuracy of the impedance telemetry function.<h4>Results</h4>Within the clinically relevant dose range (< 80 Gy), implant function in all four devices was normal. Failure occurred in one Nucleus CI24R(CS) device treated with hyperfractionation. A dramatic drop in the output amplitude at 106 Gy was observed, and the impedance measurement failed at a total dose of 111 Gy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results suggest that conventional or hyperfractionated radiotherapy can be applied safely at Nucleus CI24M or CI24R(CS) implant systems in a patient-like setting. Therefore, the authors propose that the results of the study can be applicable in clinical practice.",

A literature review was performed identifying 277 autopsied hearts across 22 separate publications of COVID-19 positive patients. The median age of the autopsy cohort was 75 and 97.6% had one or more comorbidities. Initial review of the data indicate that myocarditis was present in 20 hearts (7.2%); however, closer examination of additional reported information revealed that most cases were likely not functionally significant and the true prevalence of myocarditis is likely much lower (<2%). At least one acute, potentially COVID-19-related cardiovascular histopathologic finding, such as macro or microvascular thrombi, inflammation, or intraluminal megakaryocytes, was reported in 47.8% of cases.

Though mechanisms underlying DBS are still unclear, commonly accepted theories include a ""functional inhibition"" of neuronal cell bodies and the excitation of axonal projections near the electrodes. It is becoming clear, however, that the paradoxical dissociation ""local inhibition"" and ""distant excitation"" is far more complex than initially thought. Despite an initial increase in neuronal activity following stimulation, cells are often unable to maintain normal ionic concentrations, particularly those of sodium and potassium. Based on currently available evidence, we proposed an alternative hypothesis. Increased extracellular concentrations of potassium during DBS may change the dynamics of both cells and axons, contributing not only to the intermittent excitation and inhibition of these elements but also to interrupt abnormal pathological activity. In this article, we review mechanisms through which high extracellular potassium may mediate some of the effects of DBS.",

Tuberculous involvement of the sternum is a rare clinical entity even in countries where tuberculosis has high prevalence. Primary tuberculous sternal osteomyelitis accounts for approximately 0.3% of all types of tubercular osteomyelitis and the probable source appears to be extension from paratracheal or hilar lymph nodes. Despite tuberculosis being a common disease in endemic countries and worldwide, a thorough literature search of the PubMed database for keywords ""primary tuberculosis of sternum"" and ""primary tuberculous osteomyelitis of sternum"" yielded 30 and 22 articles, respectively.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We present an unusual case of a large dumb-bell-shaped cold abscess arising due to infection of the sternum. A 23-year-old immunocompetent Asian woman presented with a gradually progressing painless swelling on anterior chest wall for the last 5 months. She had a large visible swelling on anterior chest wall which was 12.5 cm in diameter, soft, non-tender, temperature was not raised, and fluctuant. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large dumb-bell-shaped hyperintense collection in upper anterior chest wall with marrow edema and cortical irregularity in left side of manubrium. Pus was positive for nucleic acid testing (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and later culture was also positive. She was started on anti-tubercular therapy and aspirated twice. Currently, she has completed 6 months of therapy and the swelling has now disappeared.<h4>Discussion</h4>Swelling, pain localized to sternum, or ulceration of the skin with discharging sinus along with or without constitutional symptoms are the usual presentation. A high element of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent its complications. Sternal mycobacterial infections are categorized as primary, secondary, and/or acquired postoperatively. Although radiological investigations aid in diagnosis, the diagnosis is established by positive culture or histopathological examination. Anti-tubercular therapy is the mainstay of treatment with standard four-drug regimen for 6-9 months. Surgical drainage of the abscess should be considered only if it does not resolve by aspiration and anti-tubercular therapy.",https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13256-019-2210-9

This injury may have devastating sequelae. The goal of this study was to assess the long-term outcome of high-pressure injection injury to the hand.<h4>Methods</h4>In this historical prospective study, patients who had previously sustained high-pressure injection injury were examined. Assessment included measurement of grip and pinch strength, range of motion, two-point discrimination, and use of a questionnaire regarding present complaints and return to the work force.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three patients were examined. Follow-up length was on average 8.5 years. The injured hand was most often (43 percent) the right dominant hand, the index in 65 percent, the thumb in 25 percent, and other locations in 10 percent. Only 43 percent of patients returned to their previous employment. Patient complaints were, in descending frequency, cold intolerance, hypersensitivity, paresthesias, constant pain, and impairment of activities of daily living. Metacarpophalangeal range of motion was decreased on average by 8.1 percent (p = 0.019), proximal interphalangeal joint range of motion was decreased by 23.9 percent (p = 0.001), and distal interphalangeal range of motion was decreased by 29.7 percent (p= 0.018).

The aim of this study is to present a clear picture of the entire spectrum of pediatric ACTs by reviewing one of the largest noncollected pediatric series treated in a single medical center.<h4>Methods</h4>Records of children treated for ACTs in our unit between 1970 and 1999, inclusive, were reviewed. Information recorded for each patient included age, sex, clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, stage of disease, treatment, pathologic findings, and outcome. The patients were subdivided into 2 groups: group I, patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and group II, patients with adrenocortical adenoma (ACA). These groups were analyzed with regard to parameters mentioned above.<h4>Results</h4>There were 30 children treated for ACTs in the study period with a mean age of 6.7 +/- 4.2 years (range, 2.5 to 13 years). Of these, 20 had ACC, and 10 had ACA. The tumors were right sided in 22 patients, left sided in 6 and bilateral in 2. Analysis of each group with regard to age and site of tumor showed no significant difference. Endocrine dysfunction was noted in 83% of the patients and virilization was the most common presentation followed by Cushing's syndrome. The most striking difference between 2 groups was the prepondarance of virilization in group II and Cushing's syndrome in group I. In the latter, 14 patients presented with palpable abdominal mass and 3 patients with distant metastases. The mean time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 8.1 +/- 0.2 months, and this interval was similar in 2 groups, in functional and nonfunctional tumors, and in both sexes. Ultrasound scan, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, intravenous pyelography, and angiography were used for the diagnosis. All patients with ACA had localized disease, whereas 80% of the patients with ACC had regional or metastatic disease. Total excision was done in all patients with ACA, but only in 13 patients with ACCs. Of the latter, 2 patients underwent ipsilateral nephrectomy, and 1 patient had right hepatic lobectomy plus nephrectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of mitotane (n = 12), mitotane plus cisplatin and etoposide (n = 2) was commenced. Seven patients with ACC had distant metastases postoperatively. The presence of regional disease at presentation was associated with a significantly shorter disease-free interval. All patients presenting with nonfunctional ACC (n = 4), functional ACC that have been totally resected (n = 4), and partially resected (n = 3) died of disease within the first 2.5 years after diagnosis. There was no significant difference between the functional and nonfunctional ACCs with regard to survival rate. All patients who had distant metastases postoperatively and who had partial excision died. Of the surviving 9 patients with ACC, there are 6 known long-term survivors who are still alive.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ACAs are treated by total excision satisfactorily without any complication. For the time being, the most important aspect of therapy for ACCs is early diagnosis and total excision. Partial excision and advanced-stage disease are the major determinants of poor outcome. None of the clinical, laboratory, or pathologic features are reliable predictors for recurrence and discrimination of malignancy in ACTs. Because of the steadily increasing incidence of precancerous genetic syndromes of adrenal glands and poor prognosis of ACCs, childhood patients of endocrine disorders should receive a detailed and vigorous diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment as given to adults. Patients with ACTs should be entered into multi-institutional trials to adequately assess effective chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols and molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis.

A prospective study of conservative management in 51 cases.,10.1097/00000658-198901000-00015,"Parekh D, Glezerson G, Stewart M, Esser J, Lawson HH.",1989,Annals of surgery,"The management of parotid sialoceles and fistulae have been unsatisfactory in the past, and numerous methods of treatment with varying success and morbidity have been described. The present prospective study reports results of conservative therapy in 51 patients over a 3-year period. In 50 patients, the injury healed upon conservative management. During the early phase of the study, a limited conservative regimen through which the patients received nothing orally for 5 days only was used. During the latter part of the study, patients were administered nothing orally until complete healing of the injury. In terms of the time it took for healing of the injury, the differences of the two regimens (24 +/- 4 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.9 days) was highly significant (p less than 0.001). The response to conservative management depended on the severity of injury as demonstrated by sialography. Injury to minor intraparotid ducts (G1) healed in significantly less time compared with that to a major intraparotid duct (G2) or ductal injuries (p less than 0.001). There was no difference between the healing of G2 injury (10.3 +/- 1.8 days) and partial ductal transections (10.5 +/- 2.2 days) (p greater than 0.05). There was a significantly greater delay in healing with complete duct transections (21.5 +/- 3.7 days) compared with partial duct transections and G2 injuries (10.2 +/- 2.1 days) (p less than 0.01). There was no difference in the mean period for healing between salivary fistulae and sialoceles (p greater than 0.05). It is concluded that a new classification of parotid fistulae based on sialographic findings has prognostic and therapeutic value. Furthermore, the excellent results achieved with conservative therapy in this study suggest that it may be the initial treatment of choice for parotid fistulae.",

Over the past decade the scientific and medical community has had the opportunity to evaluate the safety record of research studies and clinical applications of TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS). In these years the number of applications of conventional TMS has grown impressively, new paradigms of stimulation have been developed (e.g., patterned repetitive TMS) and technical advances have led to new device designs and to the real-time integration of TMS with electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thousands of healthy subjects and patients with various neurological and psychiatric diseases have undergone TMS allowing a better assessment of relative risks. The occurrence of seizures (i.e., the most serious TMS-related acute adverse effect) has been extremely rare, with most of the few new cases receiving rTMS exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients under treatment with drugs which potentially lower the seizure threshold. The present updated guidelines review issues of risk and safety of conventional TMS protocols, address the undesired effects and risks of emerging TMS interventions, the applications of TMS in patients with implanted electrodes in the central nervous system, and safety aspects of TMS in neuroimaging environments. We cover recommended limits of stimulation parameters and other important precautions, monitoring of subjects, expertise of the rTMS team, and ethical issues. While all the recommendations here are expert based, they utilize published data to the extent possible.",

Stimulation in Vim eliminated dystonic spasms. Subsequent implantation of 4 permanent deep brain stimulation electrodes in bilateral Vim and Gpi nuclei resolved dystonic spasms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of temporary stimulation and recording electrodes to identify deep brain stimulation targets is a promising new technique that could improve outcomes in children with acquired dystonia.",

The peer-reviewed published reports included general surveys, prospective studies, and multicenter studies, but excluded case reports. Satisfactory clinical results were reported in 63.5% of hips in 24 studies of core decompression and in 22.7% of hips in 21 studies of nonoperative management. When looking at only precollapse hips, there were 71% versus 34.5% good results, respectively. Recalculation excluding reports by the 4 centers that do the most core decompressions (and report the best results) showed a clinical success rate for core decompression of 53% versus 22.7% for the nonoperatively treated group. Investigators of multiple studies have reported that nonoperative management leads to extremely poor results. Core decompression has been reported to have a notable effect on the natural history and clinical progression in early stages of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. In view of the limitations of this data, further clarification of this effect only can be obtained by large prospective randomized studies.",

Iatrogenically impaired immune surveillance and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection/reactivation are key factors in the pathogenesis. However, current knowledge on all aspects of PTLD is limited due to its rarity, morphologic heterogeneity, and the lack of prospective trials. Furthermore, the broad spectrum of underlying immune disorders and the type of graft represent important confounding factors. Despite these limitations, several reviews have been written aimed at offering a guide for pathologists and clinicians in diagnosing and treating PTLD. Rather than providing another classical review on PTLD, this ""How I Treat"" article, based on 2 case reports, focuses on specific challenges, different perspectives, and novel insights regarding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of PTLD. These challenges include the wide variety of PTLD presentation (making treatment optimization difficult), the impact of EBV on pathogenesis and clinical behavior, and the controversial treatment of Burkitt lymphoma (BL)-PTLD.",

In addition, the present review evaluated whether patients presenting with LM as the primary site of relapse exhibit differences in survival when compared with patients exhibiting metastasis to other sites. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that LM is commonly associated with other sites of distant metastasis including lung, liver and bone metastases. The histological breast cancer subtype most commonly associated with LM was invasive lobular carcinoma, while triple-negative breast cancer patients appear to be predisposed to the development of LM when considering the overall prevalence of histological breast cancer subtypes. At present, data regarding LM as the primary site of relapse are limited due to its rarity as the first site of metastasis in breast cancer. Case-controlled studies are required to investigate the incidence of LM as the primary site of recurrence in breast cancer patients as this would enable treatment standardization and identification of prognostic factors for improved survival.",

We included all patients with noninfectious encephalopathy (clouding of consciousness and impaired cognitive function) and high serum antithyroid antibody concentrations. We excluded patients if they did not meet these inclusion criteria or if their symptoms could be explained by another neurologic disorder. We recorded clinical features and the results of imaging, electroencephalographic, thyroid function, and cerebrospinal fluid studies.<h4>Data synthesis</h4>We identified 85 patients (69 women and 16 men; mean age, 44 years) with encephalopathy and high serum antithyroid antibody concentrations. Among these patients, 23 (27%) had strokelike signs, 56 (66%) had seizures, 32 (38%) had psychosis, 66 (78%) had a high cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration, and 80 (98%) of 82 had abnormal electroencephalographic findings. Thyroid function varied from overt hypothyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism; the most common abnormality was subclinical hypothyroidism (30 patients [35%]). Among patients treated with glucocorticoids, 66 (96%) improved.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combination of encephalopathy, high serum antithyroid antibody concentrations, and responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy seems unlikely to be due to chance. However, there is no evidence of a pathogenic role for the antibodies, which are probably markers of some other autoimmune disorder affecting the brain.",

To determine whether these similarities may indicate common genetic alterations, we studied the genetic profile of 10 MCCs and analyzed 6 derived cell lines and 5 skin SCC lines by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and molecular genetic analyses. Although the MCCs were highly divergent-only 3 of the 10 tumors exhibited common gains and losses-they shared gain of 8q21-q22 and loss of 4p15-pter with the genetically much more homogeneous SCC lines. In addition, 2 of 5 SCC and 2 of 6 MCC lines exhibited UV-B-type-specific mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene and a high frequency (9/11) of CC-->TT double base changes in codon 27 of the Harvey (Ha)-ras gene. Since 45% of the tumor lines were homozygous for this nucleotide substitution compared to 14% of the controls and in 1 MCC patient the wild-type allele was lost in the tumor, this novel polymorphism may contribute to tumor development. On the other hand, loss of 3p, characteristic for SCCs, was rare in MCCs. Although in 2 of 3 SCC lines 3p loss was correlated with reduced expression of the FHIT (fragile histidine triad) gene, the potential tumor suppressor mapped to 3p14.2 and 2 MCC lines with normal 3p showed aberrant or no FHIT transcripts. Taken together, in addition to the common UV-B-specific mutations in the p53 and Ha-ras gene, MCCs and SCCs also share chromosomal imbalances that may point to a common environmental-derived (e.g., UV-A) oxidative damage.",

Delay in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy has been recognized as a risk factor for mortality. To perform a retrospective analysis on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign database to evaluate the relationship between timing of antibiotic administration and mortality.<h4>Design</h4>Retrospective analysis of a large dataset collected prospectively for the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.<h4>Setting</h4>One hundred sixty-five ICUs in Europe, the United States, and South America.<h4>Patients</h4>A total of 28,150 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, from January 2005 through February 2010, were evaluated.<h4>Interventions</h4>Antibiotic administration and hospital mortality.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>A total of 17,990 patients received antibiotics after sepsis identification and were included in the analysis. In-hospital mortality was 29.7% for the cohort as a whole. There was a statically significant increase in the probability of death associated with the number of hours of delay for first antibiotic administration. Hospital mortality adjusted for severity (sepsis severity score), ICU admission source (emergency department, ward, vs ICU), and geographic region increased steadily after 1 hour of time to antibiotic administration. Results were similar in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, regardless of the number of organ failure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of the analysis of this large population of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock demonstrate that delay in first antibiotic administration was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In addition, there was a linear increase in the risk of mortality for each hour delay in antibiotic administration. These results underscore the importance of early identification and treatment of septic patients in the hospital setting.",

Visual function sometimes deteriorates postoperatively for patients with a large aneurysm. In this study, we report the long-term follow-up of patients with visual impairments attributed to optic nerve compression when paraclinoid aneurysms are surgically treated.<h4>Methods</h4>Seventeen patients with optic nerve impairment induced by compression of paraclinoid ICA aneurysms were treated. All of the aneurysms were large, including 6 giant aneurysms. The aneurysms displayed partial thrombosis or calcification of the aneurysmal wall in 6 cases.<h4>Results</h4>Direct surgery such as neck clipping or wrapping of the aneurysm was performed in 9 aneurysms and indirect procedures in 8 others (ICA occlusion, 1; ICA occlusion + bypass, 7). Of 17 patients, 11 (65%) showed improvement in several dysfunctions of visual acuity or visual field. Of 6 patients, whose vision had not recovered well, 5 underwent direct surgery. Moreover, these 5 patients had an intra-aneurysmal thrombosis or calcification of the aneurysmal wall. Nevertheless, 1 patient whose aneurysm with partial thrombosis was treated via indirect procedure had good recovery of vision.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Direct clipping is the treatment of choice for patients with a mass effect on the optic nerve due to paraclinoid aneurysm. However, it is difficult to achieve sufficient decompression of the optic nerve when the aneurysm is accompanied by partial thrombosis or calcification of the aneurysmal wall. In those cases, an indirect procedure seems to be a relatively safe, effective treatment.",

In this entity the correct diagnosis is frequently missed because of uncharacteristic changes in other imaging modalities.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Forty-nine patients (age range 15-65 years old, mean age 36 years) with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCCH) and/or pustulotic arthroosteitis (PAO) were examined with whole-body scintigraphy and conventional radiography.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-three of 49 patients with SCCH/PAO showed a characteristic ""bullhead""-like high tracer uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the manubrium sterni representing the upper skull and the inflamed sternoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns (= bullhead sign). Scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations (spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteitis) in 33 of 49 patients with SCCH and/or PAO.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Bone scintigraphy is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of skeletal involvement in PAO. Nuclear medicine reveals unexpected locations and shows the typical pattern of focal hot spots of the spine, sacroiliac joints and/or appendicular skeleton in the large majority of cases in combination with a bullhead-like tracer uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region. The bullhead sign is the typical and highly specific scintigraphic manifestation of SCCH and PAO in radionuclide bone scans and helps to avoid unnecessary biopsies.",

Inherited AT deficiencies are uncommon, with prevalences in the general population between 1 in 500 and 1 in 5000. They are either quantitative (type I) or qualitative (type II). Type II is subdivided into the more common, but less thrombogenic, type IIb deficiency caused by a defect in the heparin-binding region of AT and the less common, but more thrombophilic, type IIa variant caused by mutations in the thrombin-binding site. A pleiotropic type IIc deficiency also exists. In the evaluation of a thrombophilic individual, a functional AT assay (AT activity) should be used and the diagnosis of AT deficiency only established after acquired causes have been ruled out and repeat AT testing on an additional sample has been performed. A subsequent antigenic AT assay result leads to differentiation between type I and type II deficiency. Further specialized tests help subclassify the type II deficiencies, but this is typically not carried out for clinical purposes, even though it might be helpful to assess thrombosis risk. AT deficiency is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pregnancy loss. The association with arterial thrombosis is only weak. VTE prophylaxis and treatment management will be discussed in this article and existing treatment guidelines presented.

However, rTMS treatment response can be slow. Early research suggests that accelerated forms of rTMS may be effective but no research has directly evaluated a schedule of accelerated rTMS compared to standard rTMS. To assess the efficacy of accelerated rTMS compared to standard daily rTMS., 115 outpatients with MDD received either accelerated rTMS (n = 58) (i.e., 63,000 high frequency rTMS pulses delivered as 3 treatments per day over 3 days in week 1, 3 treatments over 2 days in week 2 and 3 treatments on a single day in week 3) or standard rTMS (n = 57) (i.e., 63,000 total high frequency rTMS pulses delivered over 5 days per week for 4 weeks) following randomization.

The present case highlights the key surgical aspects of two carotid-ophthalmic TandIAs incidentally found in a 60-year-old female. Both the aneurysms were superiorly projecting, regular in size, and involved the left ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The minimum distance between the necks was 3 mm. The patient underwent microsurgery because of the reported major complications rate of the endovascular treatment in the case of a very short minimum distance between the TandIAs. After cervical ICA exposure, both the aneurysms were excluded through a pterional approach. Intradural anterior clinoidectomy and unroofing of the optic canal allowed the mobilization of the left optic nerve. The more distal aneurysm was clipped before the opening of the distal dural ring of the ICA. The proximal aneurysm was clipped with two straight clips stacked perpendicular to the ICA. A small remnant was intentionally left to avoid the stenosis of the ophthalmic artery.

While pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be fully unravelled, new insights and discoveries are yielding significant improvements in outcome, particularly in the high mortality conditions of shock and multi-organ failure. One potential target is the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, an ion channel critical to the cardiovascular stress response. Excessive activation of the vascular channel is now recognised as a major cause of hypotension and vascular hyporesponsiveness to catecholamines in septic shock. Some researchers advocate therapeutic blockade of these channels; however, outside the vasculature, channel opening may actually represent a protective mechanism against cellular damage. In this review we critically examine the role of the K(ATP) channel in sepsis.",

Disease progression occurred in 34%, and 26% of patients died due to MF/SS. A significant difference in survival and progression was noted for patients with early-stage disease having patches alone (T1a/T2a) compared with those having patches and plaques (T1b/T2b). Univariate analysis established that (1) advanced skin and overall clinical stage, increased age, male sex, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and large-cell transformation were associated with reduced survival and increased RDP; (2) hypopigmented MF, MF with lymphomatoid papulosis, and poikilodermatous MF were associated with improved survival and reduced RDP; and (3) folliculotropic MF was associated with an increased RDP. Multivariate analysis established that (1) advanced skin (T) stage, the presence in peripheral blood of the tumor clone without Sézary cells (B0b), increased LDH, and folliculotropic MF were independent predictors of poor survival and increased RDP; (2) large-cell transformation and tumor distribution were independent predictors of increased RDP only; and (3) N, M, and B stages; age; male sex; and poikilodermatous MF were only significant for survival.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study has validated the recently proposed ISCL/EORTC staging system and identified new prognostic factors.",

However, the data from Chinese girls remain ambiguous. The aims of this study were to estimate the puberty milestones and examine attainment of puberty associated with obesity and central obesity in Chinese Han schoolgirls.<h4>Methods</h4>The cross-sectional school-based study examined 2996 Han schoolgirls aged 9 to 19 years from 6 provinces in China. Trained clinicians assessed  the girls for height, weight, waist circumference, Tanner stages of breast and pubic hair development, and menarcheal status. We classified girls as normal weight, overweight, or obese based on BMI, and as normal weight or central obese based on the waist-height ratio, then estimated and compared median age at a given Tanner stage or greater by weight class using Probit models.<h4>Results</h4>The median age at menarche was 12.36 years. The median ages at breast stages(B) 2 through 5 were 10.03, 11.38, 13.39, and 15.79 years, respectively, and at pubic hair stages(PH) 2 through 5 were 11.62, 12.70, 14.38, and 16.92 years, respectively. Girls from urban areas experienced menarche, B3 and B4 stages, and PH3 through PH5 stages earlier. Girls with central obesity and overweight/obesity reached puberty earlier at almost every Tanner stage of breast and pubic hair than normal girls. Girls with obesity developed PH2 and PH3 earlier than their overweight peers. However, we did not find any significant differences between girls with overweight and obesity at all stages of breast development.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Childhood obesity, including both overweight/obesity and central obesity, is associated with earlier attainment of puberty in Chinese Han schoolgirls.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6317212?pdf=render

Follow-up ranged from 6 to 88 months after implantation. Three patients were implanted with residual useful hearing in the contralateral ear, whereas four patients had no hearing in the contralateral ear. Hearing loss was due to surgical excision of tumor (n=5) or gamma-knife radiotherapy (n=2). Postactivation pure-tone average thresholds in the implanted ear ranged from 30 to 55 dB (average, 32.5 dB), although speech reception testing varied considerably among subjects. Despite this variability, all patients continue to use the device on a daily basis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In selected cases of deafness in patients with NF2 where there has been anatomic preservation of the auditory nerve after acoustic neuroma resection or radiation therapy, cochlear implantation may offer some improvement in communication skills, including the possibility of open-set speech communication in some patients. These results compare favorably to the auditory brainstem implant offering an alternative for hearing rehabilitation in patients with NF2.",

Many studies have demonstrated that chemo-radiotherapy for cancer patients and exposure to certain chemicals may increase the risk of secondary MDS, which is characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities and genomic alterations. Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely used for the diagnosis of cancer patients, advanced analysis of the sequencing data may provide supplementary information for secondary MDS.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A male patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bone metastases has presented distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar, mediastinal lymph node metastases, and multiple bone metastases. This patient has undergone long-term exposures to certain chemicals. Moreover, the deletion of chromosome 7 and 5q is detected in his peripheral blood sequencing, indicating secondary MDS, subsequently confirmed by bone marrow examination.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this case, an NSCLC patient was diagnosed with secondary MDS via NGS analysis, indicating that the NGS analysis may serve as supplementary for diagnosis of secondary MDS and provide useful information of therapeutic regimens for subsequent-line treatment of EGFR-mutated lung cancer.

It is thought of as a mild disorder; affected children's symptoms respond promptly to salt therapy, and treatment is not required after childhood. Mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (MR) cause adPHA1, but the long-term consequences of MR deficiency in humans are not known. Herein are described six novel adPHA1-causing MR mutations (four de novo) and evidence that haploinsufficiency of MR is sufficient to cause adPHA1. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype correlation is reported in a large adPHA1 kindred. A number of cases of neonatal mortality in infants who were at risk for adPHA1 were identified; coupled with the frequent identification of de novo mutations in affected individuals, this suggests that the seemingly benign adPHA1 may have been a fatal neonatal disorder in previous eras, preventing propagation of disease alleles. In contrast, it is shown that adult patients with adPHA1 are clinically indistinguishable from their wild-type relatives except for presumably lifelong elevation of renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels. These data highlight the critical role of MR in the maintenance of salt homeostasis early in life and illuminate the sodium dependence of pathologic effects of renin and angiotensin II. They furthermore argue that nongenomic effects of aldosterone play no significant role in the long-term development of cardiovascular disease.",

The frequency and type of isolated psychiatric episodes (pure psychiatric symptoms without neurological involvement) either as initial presentation of the disease or as relapse are unknown.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the frequency, symptoms, and outcome of isolated psychiatric episodes in a cohort of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>Observational cohort of patients diagnosed during a5-year period (median follow-up, 2 years). A total of 571 patients with IgG antibodies against the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR were included in the study. Antibody studies were performed at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Barcelona, and clinical information was obtained by us or referring physicians.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Frequency, type of symptoms, and outcome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and isolated psychiatric manifestations.<h4>Results</h4>Of 571 patients, 23 (4%) developed isolated psychiatric episodes, 5 at disease onset and 18 during relapse. For all 23 patients, age (median, 20 years), sex (91%female), and tumor association (43%; ovarian teratoma in all cases) were similar to the population at large.Predominant symptoms included delusional thinking (74%), mood disturbances (70%,usually manic), and aggression (57%). Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were abnormal in 10 of 22 patients (45%) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed pleocytosis in 17 of 22 patients (77%). Eighty-three percent of the patients had full or substantial recovery after immunotherapy and tumor resection when appropriate. After relapse, 17 of 18 patients(94%) returned to a similar or better prerelapse functional level.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Isolated psychiatric episodes are rare but can occur as initial onset or relapse of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Recognition of these episodes is important because they respond to immunotherapy. In patients with new-onset psychosis, having a history of encephalitis, subtle neurological symptoms, and/or abnormal results on ancillary tests should prompt screening for NMDAR antibodies.",

Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7405836?pdf=render

Association of tumors with horseshoe kidney is also uncommon, with fewer than 200 cases having been reported in the literature, and the association of tumors with crossed-fused ectopia is even rarer, with only four cases having been reported so far.<h4>Material and methods</h4>During the past decade five patients with fusion anomalies have been treated for tumors in our clinic, four of whom had horseshoe kidney and one of whom had crossed-fused left-to-right ectopia. The clinical, diagnostic and operative peculiarities of each case are presented and the recent literature on this topic is reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>Two patients were diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, two had transitional cell carcinoma and one had oncocytoma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The commonest tumor reported in kidney fusion anomalies is renal cell carcinoma, although its reported incidence is no higher than that in the normal population. In the case of transitional cell carcinomas, diagnosis is usually made at an advanced stage. The value of thorough urologic and radiological investigations is stressed. Angiography, whether classical or in combination with multi-slice CT, is considered essential in order to confirm renal anomalies and the tumor situation and to plan the surgical approach.

It has been observed that the incidence of SCLC has been decreasing over the last several years.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the Surveillance, Epidemiologic, and End Results (SEER) database to determine the incidence of SCLC over the last 30 years. In addition, we sought to determine sex- and stage-based differences in the incidence and survival of SCLC among a proportion of reported cases of lung cancer over the last 30 years (1973 to 2002). Joinpoint analyses were applied to test the trends in annual percentage change for statistical significance.<h4>Results</h4>The proportion of SCLC (among all lung cancer histologic types) decreased from 17.26% in 1986 to 12.95% in 2002. Of all patients with SCLC, the proportion of women with SCLC increased from 28% in 1973% to 50% in 2002. A modest but statistically significant improvement in 2- and 5-year survival was noted among both limited-stage SCLC and extensive-stage SCLC cohorts during the study period.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our analysis indicates that the incidence of SCLC is decreasing in the United States, and only modest improvements have been seen in survival over the last 30 years. Possible explanations for the decreasing incidence include the decrease in the percentage of smokers and the change to low-tar filter cigarettes. Despite trends toward modest improvement in survival, the outcome remains very poor.",

Follow-up imaging 3 days after the initial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a fulminant disease progression associated with the serious clinical deterioration of the patient. In light of the results of a minor salivary gland biopsy, autoantibody testing, nerve conduction studies, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging, primary Sjögren's syndrome with cryoglobulinemia type II was diagnosed. Response to plasmapheresis and subsequent administration of cyclophosphamide was favorable.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Even though exocrinopathy is the hallmark of Sjögren's syndrome, systemic symptoms are observed in one-third of patients. There is an urgent need to better characterize the mechanisms underlying different disease phenotypes and to perform randomized controlled trials in order to provide tailored and evidence-based treatment for primary Sjögren's syndrome.",https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13256-019-2086-8

Although there is a wide consensus about the relationship between macroscopic vascular lesions and incident dementia, the cognitive consequences of the progressive accumulation of these small vascular lesions in the human brain are still a matter of debate. Among the vast group of small vessel-related forms of ischemic brain injuries, the present review discusses the cognitive impact of cortical microinfarcts, subcortical gray matter and deep white matter lacunes, periventricular and diffuse white matter demyelinations, and focal or diffuse gliosis in old age. A special focus will be on the sub-types of microvascular lesions not detected by currently available neuroimaging studies in routine clinical settings. After providing a critical overview of in vivo data on white matter demyelinations and lacunes, we summarize the clinicopathological studies performed by our center in large cohorts of individuals with microvascular lesions and concomitant AD-related pathology across two age ranges (the younger old, 65-85 years old, versus the oldest old, nonagenarians and centenarians). In conjunction with other autopsy datasets, these observations fully support the idea that cortical microinfarcts are the only consistent determinant of cognitive decline across the entire spectrum from pure vascular cases to cases with combined vascular and AD lesion burden.",

It was once called the forgotten disease because of its rarity, but it may not be that uncommon after all. This review aims to provide physicians with an update on the etiology, management, and prognosis of Lemierre's syndrome.<h4>Methods</h4>Systematic review using the terms: Lemierre's syndrome, postanginal septicemia, fusobacterium, internal jugular vein thrombosis.<h4>Inclusion criteria</h4>English literature; reviews, case reports, and case series.<h4>Exclusion criteria</h4>variants or atypical Lemierre's syndrome cases, negative fusobacteria cultures, and papers without radiological evidence of thrombophlebitis.<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-four studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The male to female ratio was 1:1, 2, and the ages ranged from 2 months to 78 years (median, 22 years). Main sources of infection were tonsil, pharynx, and chest. Most common first clinical presentation was a sore throat, followed by a neck mass and neck pain. The most common offending micro-organism was F. necrophorum. Treatment modalities used were antimicrobial, anticoagulant, and surgical treatment. Morbidity was significant with prolonged hospitalization in the majority of patients. The overall mortality rate was 5%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Lemierre's syndrome may not be as rare as previously thought. This apparent increase in the incidence may be due to antibiotic resistance or changes in antibiotic prescription patterns. Successful management rests on the awareness of the condition, a high index of suspicion, and a multidisciplinary team approach.",

Historically, FM was almost exclusively diagnosed at autopsy. By definition, all patients with FM will need some form of inotropic or mechanical circulatory support to maintain end-organ perfusion until transplantation or recovery. Specific subtypes of FM may respond to immunomodulatory therapy in addition to guideline-directed medical care. Despite the increasing availability of circulatory support, orthotopic heart transplantation, and disease-specific treatments, patients with FM experience significant morbidity and mortality as a result of a delay in diagnosis and initiation of circulatory support and lack of appropriately trained specialists to manage the condition. This scientific statement outlines the resources necessary to manage the spectrum of FM, including extracorporeal life support, percutaneous and durable ventricular assist devices, transplantation capabilities, and specialists in advanced heart failure, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac pathology, immunology, and infectious disease. Education of frontline providers who are most likely to encounter FM first is essential to increase timely access to appropriately resourced facilities, to prevent multiorgan system failure, and to tailor disease-specific therapy as early as possible in the disease process.",

The clinical course is typically self-limited and benign; however, rare cases of severe pneumonia can develop despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. We studied the effects of methylprednisolone pulse therapy on severe refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children.<h4>Methods</h4>The clinical effects of methylprednisolone therapy were evaluated retrospectively in 12 children with severe refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which was diagnosed serologically. All patients developed respiratory distress, high fever, and initial lobar pneumonic consolidation based on radiological findings. All clinical symptoms deteriorated despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Thus, children were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy in addition to antibiotics.<h4>Results</h4>The average febrile period before admission was 4.9±1.7 days, and fever persisted in all children until steroid administration. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg) was given 5.4±2.5 days after admission. After methylprednisolone pulse therapy, clinical symptoms improved in all patients without adverse events. The fever subsided 0-2 h after initiation of corticosteroid therapy. The abnormal radiological findings resolved within 2.6±1.3 days, and the high C-reactive protein levels (6.7±5.9 mg/dL) on admission decreased to 1.3±1.7 mg/dL within 3.0±1.1 days after starting corticosteroid therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Three-day methylprednisolone pulse therapy could be applied to treatment of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and appeared to be efficacious and well-tolerated.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3881395?pdf=render

Nevertheless, its public health significance on malaria severity remains poorly understood.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>To contribute to a better understanding of epidemiology and control of this co-infection in Cameroon, a cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the prevalence of concomitant intestinal geohelminthiasis and malaria, and to evaluate its association with malaria and anaemia in Nkassomo and Vian. Finger prick blood specimens from a total of 263 participants aged 1-95 years were collected for malaria microscopy, assessment of haemoglobin levels, and molecular identification of Plasmodium species by PCR. Fresh stool specimens were also collected for the identification and quantification of geohelminths by the Kato-Katz method. The prevalence of malaria, geohelminths, and co-infections were 77.2%, 28.6%, and 22.1%, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite species identified with mean parasite density of 111 (40; 18,800) parasites/µl of blood. The geohelminths found were Ascaris lumbricoides (21.6%) and Trichuris trichiura (10.8%), with mean parasite densities of 243 (24; 3,552) and 36 (24; 96) eggs/gram of faeces, respectively. Co-infections of A. lumbricoides and P. falciparum were the most frequent and correlated positively. While no significant difference was observed on the prevalences of single and co-infections between the two localities, there was a significant difference in the density of A. lumbricoides infection between the two localities. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 42%, with individuals co-infected with T. trichiura and P. falciparum (60%) being the most at risk. While the prevalence of malaria and anaemia were inversely related to age, children aged 5-14 years were more susceptible to geohelminthiasis and their co-infections with malaria.<h4>Conclusion/significance</h4>Co-existence of geohelminths and malaria parasites in Nkassomo and Vian enhances the occurrence of co-infections, and consequently, increases the risk for anaemia.",https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003236&type=printable

Advanced Merkel-cell carcinoma often responds to chemotherapy, but responses are transient. Blocking the programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune inhibitory pathway is of interest, because these tumors often express PD-L1, and MCPyV-specific T cells express PD-1.<h4>Methods</h4>In this multicenter, phase 2, noncontrolled study, we assigned adults with advanced Merkel-cell carcinoma who had received no previous systemic therapy to receive pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) at a dose of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Efficacy was correlated with tumor viral status, as assessed by serologic and immunohistochemical testing.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 26 patients received at least one dose of pembrolizumab. The objective response rate among the 25 patients with at least one evaluation during treatment was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35 to 76); 4 patients had a complete response, and 10 had a partial response. With a median follow-up of 33 weeks (range, 7 to 53), relapses occurred in 2 of the 14 patients who had had a response (14%). The response duration ranged from at least 2.2 months to at least 9.7 months. The rate of progression-free survival at 6 months was 67% (95% CI, 49 to 86). A total of 17 of the 26 patients (65%) had virus-positive tumors. The response rate was 62% among patients with MCPyV-positive tumors (10 of 16 patients) and 44% among those with virus-negative tumors (4 of 9 patients). Drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 15% of the patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, first-line therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced Merkel-cell carcinoma was associated with an objective response rate of 56%.

Several chromosomal aberrations have been frequently identified in melanomas, but are absent in melanocytic naevi. We performed four-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of melanocytic tumours to determine the accuracy of the technique in classifying melanocytic tumours as benign or malignant.<h4>Methods</h4>FISH was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from 40 histologically unequivocal melanocytic tumours (10 metastatic melanomas, 10 primary melanomas and 20 benign melanocytic naevi) using the product Vysis LSI RREB1/LSI MYB/LSI CCND1/CEP 6 probes (Abbott Molecular Laboratories, USA), which is designed to detect the copy number of the RREB1 (6p25), MYB (6q23), and CCND1 (11q13) genes and FISH positivity is defined by means of a scoring algorithm.<h4>Results</h4>FISH distinguished the melanomas and the naevi with a sensitivity of 90% (10/10 primary melanoma cases and 8/10 metastatic melanoma cases, respectively), and a specificity of 95%. The most common abnormalities in the melanomas were increased copies of 11q (70%) and 6p (70%), followed by 6q loss relative to cep6 (50%). Fifteen of the 18 positive melanomas were positive by more than one criterion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study show that FISH, using a panel of four probes, is a sensitive and specific method of classifying benign and malignant melanocytic tumours. The four-colour FISH technique has the potential to assist in the stratification of the subgroup of melanocytic tumours which are difficult to classify using conventional histology.",

Exploring complex detoxification mechanisms to therapeutically target those components, this article will focus on similarities, differences, and potential synergies in the mechanism of albumin dialysis and hemoperfusion.<h4>Methods</h4>An in vitro two-compartment model for the comparison of liver support techniques was used to compare MARS albumin dialysis modified with novel charcoal adsorbents to CytoSorb hemoperfusion with added hemodialysis for effects on marker molecule removal.<h4>Results</h4>MARS and CytoSorb performed similar in the removal of water-soluble toxins. Ammonia removal was increased using CytoSorb. CytoSorb lead to a statistically significant reduction of albumin-bound toxins, total bilirubin and subfractions. Bile acid removal was comparable. MARS demonstrated no removal of cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), whereas CytoSorb allowed for near complete removal. Notably, CytoSorb displayed 50% of lipophilic substance and cytokine removal during the first hour of treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Compared to MARS, CytoSorb hemoperfusion leads to an initially fast removal of cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, as well as reduction of albumin-bound toxins such as indirect bilirubin and bile acids in our model. The initial removal is also associated with removal of albumin.",

This review and meta-analysis of RCTs describes the efficacy of DBS in improving motor signs, functionality and quality of life of PD patients. Several electronic databases were consulted up to April 2013. RCTs that compared DBS plus medication versus medication (alone or plus sham DBS) in PD patients were included. Outcome measures were motor function, waking time on good functioning without troublesome dyskinesias, levodopa-equivalent dose reduction, medication-induced complications, activities of daily living, health-related quality of life, and neurocognitive and psychiatric effects. Six RCTs (n = 1,184) that compared DBS plus medication versus medication alone were included. The results show that DBS significantly improves patients' symptoms, functionality and quality of life. Effects sizes are intense for the reduction of motor signs and improvement of functionality in the off-medication phase, in addition to the reduction of the required medication dose and its associated complications. Moderate effects were observed in the case of motor signs and time in good functionality in the on-medication phase, in addition to the quality of life. Although the number of RCTs obtained is small, the total sample size is relatively large, confirming the efficacy of DBS in the control of motor signs and improvement of patients' functionality and quality of life.

All patients received first dose of 1.0 g intravenously followed by 1.0 g/12 h if not adjusted. In sixteen patients vancomycin was introduced on the day of the start of CRRT therapy. Blood samples and ultrafiltrates were obtained before and 0.5, 1, 6 and 12 h after vancomycin administration.<h4>Results</h4>On the first day, the median total vancomycin clearance (Cltot) was 0.89 mL/min/kg (range 0.31 - 2.16). CRRT clearance accounted for around 50-60% of the total clearance of vancomycin found in a population with normal renal function (0.97 mL/min/kg).

As far as we know, only 9 cases have been reported till now using F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Our patient's lesions were found to conform to standard uptake values of FDG.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It indicates that hepatic MALT lymphoma can be studied with F-FDG PET/CT like other F-FDG-avid lymphomas. It was also noted that delayed-time-point FDG PET imaging may further improve the detection of the MALT lymphoma in liver. Although the patient in this case refused further treatment, potential management options, including rituximab, which is also discussed in this review.",https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5882437?pdf=render

In fetuses with cardiac anomalies, Doppler velocimetry resistances of the ductus venosus were serially determined prior to birth. The Doppler velocimetry resistances obtained from fetuses with cardiac anomalies were in turn compared with median values derived from 267 normal pregnancies to compensate for biometric bias due to gestational age.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 72 pregnancies with fetal cardiac anomalies, 26 fetuses showed isolated congenital heart disease (CHD) without nonimmune fetal hydrops (NIFH) (group A), 10 fetuses showed isolated CHD with severe heart defects, including atrioventricular valve insufficiency and consecutive cardiogenic NIHF (group B), and 36 fetuses showed chromosomal abnormalities, nonchromosomal extracardiac malformations, noncardiogenic NIHF, and fetal growth restriction summarized as nonisolated CHD (group C). Based on the pulsatility index for the vein of the ductus venosus, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was 0.71, 0.73, and 0.86 for groups A, B, and C, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In the 36 fetuses from group C, increased pulsatility index for vein of the ductus venosus (DVPIV) yielded a significant area under the ROC curve (0.86) with a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.78. Increased DVPIVs during the second trimester of pregnancy are highly correlated with fetal cardiac anomalies associated with chromosomal and extracardiac anomalies.",

In type II deficiency, the heparin-binding-site defect (type II HBS) is considered to be relatively low thrombosis risk.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our aims were to search for SERPINC1 mutation(s) and to describe the clinical and laboratory phenotype of a large number of AT Budapest3 (ATBp3, p.Leu131Phe) carriers and confirm the presence of a founder effect.<h4>Patients/methods</h4>AT-deficient patients were recruited and carriers of ATBp3, n = 102 (63 families) were selected. To investigate the founder effect, eight intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms, a 5'-length dimorphism, and five microsatellite markers were detected. Clinical and laboratory data of the patients were collected and analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>In AT deficiency, 16 different causative mutations were found, and the great majority of patients were of type II HBS subtype. Most of them (n = 102/118, 86.5%) carried the ATBp3 mutation. The ATBp3 mutant allele was associated with one single haplotype, while different haplotypes were detected in the case of normal allele. The anti-factor Xa-based AT activity assay that we used could detect all ATBp3 patients with high sensitivity in our cohort. ATBp3 homozygosity (n = 26) was associated with thrombosis at a young age and conferred a high thrombotic risk. Half of the heterozygotes (n = 41/76, 53.9%) also had venous and/or arterial thrombosis, and pregnancy complications were also recorded.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In Hungary, the founder mutation, ATBp3, is the most common AT deficiency. Our study is the first in which the clinical characterization of ATBp3 mutation was executed in a large population.",

The selective Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199) in combination therapy has been approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, but resistance can be acquired through the upregulation of alternative antiapoptotic proteins. Here, we reported that a newly emerged histone deacetylase inhibitor, chidamide (CS055), at low-cytotoxicity dose enhanced the anti-AML activity of ABT-199, while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Moreover, we also found that chidamide showed a superior resensitization effect than romidepsin in potentiation of ABT-199 lethality. Inhibition of multiple HDACs rather than some single component might be required. The combination therapy was also effective in primary AML blasts and stem/progenitor cells regardless of disease status and genetic aberrance, as well as in a patient-derived xenograft model carrying FLT3-ITD mutation. Mechanistically, CS055 promoted leukemia suppression through DNA double-strand break and altered unbalance of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL downregulation, and Bim upregulation). Taken together, these results show the high therapeutic potential of ABT-199/CS055 combination in AML treatment, representing a potent and alternative salvage therapy for the treatment of relapsed and refractory patients with AML.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-02972-2.pdf

Forty-four patients had TNM stage IV, and 40 patients were at advanced phase at transplantation. Forty-four patients received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, and 25 underwent T-cell depletion (TCD).<h4>Results</h4>Allogeneic transplantation in MF/SS offers an estimated OS of 66% at 1 year and 54% at 3 years, primarily driven by donor type, disease phase, and type of conditioning. RIC decreased NRM (relative risk [RR] = 4.7; P = .008) without increasing REL, leading to a higher OS (RR = 2.8; P = .03). Advanced-phase disease increases REL (RR = 3.0; P = .03) and reduces PFS (RR = 4.4; P = .002) and OS (RR = 3.5; P = .023). Recipients of mRD allogeneic HCT had better PFS (RR = 2.7; P = .006) and OS (RR = 4.0; P = .001) than their mUD counterparts. The risk of REL increases with TCD (RR = 3.2; P = .005). Some patients who experience relapse can successfully undergo rescue treatment with donor lymphocyte infusions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Allogeneic transplantation is a valid therapeutic alternative for high-risk patients with advanced-stage MF/SS. Our data also suggest the existence of a clinically relevant graft-versus-lymphoma effect in MF/SS.",

Then trio-based MES was further used for identifying the potential monogenic diseases in these fetuses. Coding regions and known pathogenic non-coding regions of over 4000 disease-related genes were interrogated, and variants were classified following the guidelines of American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG).<h4>Results</h4>The 105 fetuses with structural anomalies were categorized into 12 phenotypic groups. A definitive diagnosis was achieved in 19% (20/105) of the cases, with the identification of 21 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 14 genes. The proportion of patients with diagnostic genetic variants varied between the phenotypic groups, with the highest diagnostic yield in the cardiovascular abnormalities (44%), followed by the skeletal and limb abnormalities (38%) and brain structural abnormalities (25%). In addition, 12 fetuses were detected variants of unknown significance (VOUS), while the relevance of phenotypes and variants would further evaluated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MES can identify the underlying genetic cause in fetal structural anomalies. It can further assist the management of pregnancy and genetic counseling. It was demonstrated the importance of translating prenatal MES into clinical practice.",

Therefore, it would be possible to offer an alternative (or complement) treatment to psychotropic medications and different psychological and nutritional approaches to both eating disorders (EDs) and obesity. Although there are a number of publications in these areas, a systematic review has not been conducted to date. Abstracts, letters, conference reports, dissertations, and reviews were excluded. Clinical trials and controlled human clinical trials were filtered and included in this study. Articles included were based on the population suffering from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge ED, overweight, and obesity. No restrictions were placed on the sample size. Only trials investigating the effect of neuromodulation by means of deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were included. The following databases were used to conduct the search: MEDLINE/ PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Cochrane (Search Trials, CENTRAL). Study selection was performed following the PRISMA process (PRISMA 2009 Checklist). The total number of participants in all the trials was 562 (DBS, 25; tDCS, 138; TMS, 399; range, 3-90; median, 23.5). As a result, 50% of the studies had samples of between 14 and 38 participants. Neuro-modulation in ED seems to have certain clinical potential, and therefore, this is a promising area for further research. Developments in ED neuromodulation will be linked to neuroimaging to identify potential stimulation targets and possible biomarkers of treatment response. To date, TMS and/or direct current stimulation (DCS) is not the first-line treatment yet, but it could become a preferred option of treatment in the future. Further studies should avoid small sample sizes and the use of different methodologies. Currently, neuromodulation techniques are in the experimental phase, and they are not an evidence-based treatment for ED.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=45685

There are few data describing performance of treponemal immunoassays compared to traditional treponemal tests in patients with and without syphilis.<h4>Methods</h4>We calculated sensitivity and specificity of 7 treponemal assays: (1) ADVIA Centaur (chemiluminescence immunoassay [CIA]); (2) Bioplex 2200 (microbead immunoassay); (3) fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS); (4) INNO-LIA (line immunoassay); (5) LIAISON CIA; (6) Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA); and (7) Trep-Sure (enzyme immunoassay [EIA]), using a reference standard combining clinical diagnosis and serology results. Sera were collected between May 2012-January 2013. Cases were characterized as: (1) current clinical diagnosis of syphilis: primary, secondary, early latent, late latent; (2) prior treated syphilis only; (3) no evidence of current syphilis, no prior history of syphilis, and at least 4 of 7 treponemal tests negative.<h4>Results</h4>Among 959 participants, 262 had current syphilis, 294 had prior syphilis, and 403 did not have syphilis. FTA-ABS was less sensitive for primary syphilis (78.2%) than the immunoassays or TPPA (94.5%-96.4%) (all P ≤ .01). All immunoassays were 100% sensitive for secondary syphilis, 95.2%-100% sensitive for early latent disease, and 86.8%-98.5% sensitive in late latent disease. TPPA had 100% specificity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treponemal immunoassays demonstrated excellent sensitivity for secondary, early latent, and seropositive primary syphilis. Sensitivity of FTA-ABS in primary syphilis was poor. Given its high specificity and superior sensitivity, TPPA is preferred to adjudicate discordant results with the reverse sequence algorithm over the FTA-ABS.",

Following rapid distribution and administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (2), observational studies among nursing home residents demonstrated vaccine effectiveness (VE) ranging from 53% to 92% against SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-6).

Effectiveness estimates were similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These findings indicate that mRNA vaccines provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents; however, VE was lower after the Delta variant became the predominant circulating strain in the United States. This analysis assessed VE against any infection, without being able to distinguish between asymptomatic and symptomatic presentations. Additional evaluations are needed to understand protection against severe disease in nursing home residents over time. Because nursing home residents might remain at some risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite vaccination, multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies, including infection control, testing, and vaccination of nursing home staff members, residents, and visitors, are critical.

Although it has been suggested that aiTBS may evoke beneficial neuroplasticity effects in neuronal circuits, the effects of aiTBS on brain networks have not been investigated until now. Fifty TRD patients were enrolled in a randomized double-blind sham-controlled crossover trial involving aiTBS, applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Diffusion-weighted MRI data were acquired at each of three time points (T<sub>1</sub> at baseline; T<sub>2</sub> after the first week of real/sham aiTBS stimulation; and T<sub>3</sub> after the second week of treatment). Graph analysis was performed on the structural connectivity to examine treatment-related changes in the organization of brain networks. Changes in depression severity were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Baseline data were compared with 60 healthy controls. We observed a significant reduction in depression symptoms over time (<i>p</i> < 0.001). At T<sub>1</sub>, both TRD patients and controls exhibited a small-world topology in their white matter networks.

This study aims to compare effects of MARS and ADVOS on biochemical and clinical parameters in critically ill patients with liver failure using a retrospective analysis of ECAD at Jena University Hospital. Laboratory parameters, health scoring values, and need for transfusion were recorded before and after treatment. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for repeated measurements of multiple ECAD cycles per patient. Between 2012 and 2017, n = 75 MARS and n = 58 ADVOS cycles were evaluated. Although ADVOS runs significantly longer, both devices provided comparable reduction rates of bilirubin (MARS: -48 [-80.5 to -18.5] μmol/L vs ADVOS: -35 [-87.8 to -2.0] μmol/L, P = .194), a surrogate for detoxification capacity, while urea and lactate levels were more significantly lowered by the ADVOS system. In cycles with similar treatment times, both systems provided comparable reduction rates for bilirubin, renal replacement, coagulation, and metabolic parameters. Citrate was the preferred anticoagulant in case of bleeding. Neither bleeding tendency nor fibrinogen levels or platelets were altered by the type of anticoagulation. No adverse events were reported, but two sessions (one MARS and one ADVOS) were terminated early due to filter clotting.

We have investigated the structural consequences of the insertion of the Lys-Thr-Ser (KTS) sequence by preparing recombinant protein constructs of the four zinc finger DNA-binding domain of WT1 corresponding to the two isoforms with (+KTS) and without (-KTS) the insertion, which is located in the linker region between the third and fourth zinc fingers. NMR resonance assignments were used to estimate the structural differences between the two isoforms both free in solution and in complex with a 14 base pair DNA duplex corresponding to the WT1 recognition element. The NMR spectra indicate that the two isoforms are nearly identical in structure in the absence of the DNA. Only the immediate region of the insertion showed any change in chemical shifts. Upon DNA binding, the NMR spectrum of each isoform changed to indicate greater structure formation in the linker regions. Significant differences were observed between the spectra of the DNA complexes of the +KTS and -KTS isoforms, with the -KTS construct forming a more stable complex, consistent with prior biochemical assays. The majority of the differences between the spectra of the two complexes occur in the immediate region of the insertion, which appears to be closer in structure to the free form of the protein in the case of the +KTS complex. The insertion of the KTS sequence disrupts important interactions of the linker region with the adjacent zinc fingers, thus lowering the stability of the complex. The ""normal"" (-KTS) sequence of the linker appears to be involved in a C-terminal helix-capping interaction with the helix of the preceding zinc finger, a stabilizing interaction which is abrogated in the +KTS isoform.",

Whereas the assessment of the fetal heart and the related arteries is standardized using well-defined planes, the fetal venous system is still lacking a systematic approach. In this article we present a novel sonographic algorithm for a systematic examination of the fetal venous system using six planes of transverse and oblique views of the fetal abdomen and chest. These planes, using two-dimensional and color Doppler, enable a targeted demonstration of the typical veins to include the umbilical vein, ductus venosus, portal veins, hepatic veins, inferior vena cava, azygos vein, pulmonary veins, coronary sinus, superior vena cava and brachiocephalic vein. We postulate that integrating such a sequential stepwise algorithm for the evaluation of the venous system into targeted fetal cardiac imaging may improve the detection of isolated and combined anomalies of the fetal systemic and pulmonary veins.",

All titin mutations reported to date cause late-onset, dominant disorders involving either skeletal muscle or the heart. Our aim was to delineate the phenotype and determine the genetic defects in two consanguineous families with an early-onset, recessive muscle and cardiac disorder.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical and myopathological reevaluation of the five affected children, positional cloning, immunofluorescence, and Western blot studies were performed.<h4>Results</h4>All children presented with congenital muscle weakness and childhood-onset fatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed minicores, centrally located nuclei, and/or dystrophic lesions. In each family, we identified a homozygous titin deletion in exons encoding the C-terminal M-line region. Both deletions cause a frameshift downstream of the titin kinase domain and protein truncation. Immunofluorescence confirmed that truncated titins lacking the C-terminal end were incorporated into sarcomeres. Calpain 3 was secondarily depleted.<h4>Interpretation</h4>M-line titin homozygous truncations cause the first congenital and purely recessive titinopathy, and the first to involve both cardiac and skeletal muscle. These results expand the spectrum of early-onset myopathies and suggest that titin segments downstream of the kinase domain are dispensable for skeletal and cardiac muscle development, but are crucial for maintaining sarcomere integrity.",

Besides humans, cats and, to some extent, dogs were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the need for surveillance in a One Health context. Seven veterinary clinics from regions with high incidences of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were recruited during the early pandemic (March to July 2020) for the screening of patients. A total of 2257 oropharyngeal and nasal swab specimen from 877 dogs and 260 cats (including 18 animals from COVID-19-affected households and 92 animals with signs of respiratory disease) were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting the viral envelope (E) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes. One oropharyngeal swab from an Italian cat, living in a COVID-19-affected household in Piedmont, tested positive in RT-qPCR (1/260; 0.38%, 95% CI: 0.01-2.1%), and SARS-CoV-2 infection of the animal was serologically confirmed six months later. One oropharyngeal swab from a dog was potentially positive (1/877; 0.1%, 95% CI: 0.002-0.63%), but the result was not confirmed in a reference laboratory. Analyses of convenience sera from 118 animals identified one dog (1/94; 1.1%; 95% CI: 0.02-5.7%) from Lombardy, but no cats (0/24), as positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies and neutralizing activity. These findings support the hypothesis that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pet cat and dog populations, and hence, the risk of zoonotic transmission to veterinary staff, was low during the first wave of the pandemic, even in hotspot areas.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/8/1453/pdf?version=1627539668

Congenital PEMs have been reported extremely rarely and their prognosis is poorly known. Four-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for melanocytic lesions is a recent method developed to assess the malignant potential of ambiguous melanocytic lesions. Here we describe 2 cases of congenital epithelioid and strongly pigmented melanocytic lesions consistent with PEM. No BRAF gene mutation was found in the 2 cases. FISH for melanocytic lesions was also performed. The first case proved entirely negative, whereas the second one showed a positive zone with an extra copy of chromosome 6. The prognosis and management of PEM are discussed, with a review of the available data on the history, demographics, molecular alterations and histopathological aspects of this entity. PEM seems to represent a unique low-grade melanocytic tumor with a limited potential of metastasis to lymph nodes, but a favorable long-term clinical course. The published data about FISH for melanocytic tumors, and especially PEM, are reviewed. Four-color FISH may be a useful tool to assess more accurately the prognosis of these tumors.",

However, histological distinction of acral melanoma from acral naevi may be difficult. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) targeting specific genes has been used as an ancillary method for differential diagnosis of melanocytic tumours, but most previous studies have focused on non-acral lesions which may have genetic alterations different from acral lesions. We evaluated use of multi-site FISH in the diagnosis of acral melanoma in a series of 82 acral melanocytic tumours. Two probe groups were applied. Probe set 1 involved a 4-probe FISH targeting 6p25 (RREB1), CEP6 (centromere 6), 6q23 (MYB) and 11q13 (CCND1). Probe set 2 involved a 3-probe FISH targeting 8q24 (MYC), 9p21 (CDKN2A) and CEP9 (centromere 9). In 44 primary acral melanomas, sensitivity was 70.5% (31/44) using probe set 1 alone, and 59.1% (26/44) using probe set 2 alone. When both probe sets were combined, sensitivity increased to 88.6% (39/44). The frequency of each gene alteration was as follows: MYC gain in 54.5% cases (24/44), RREB1 gain in 52.3% cases (23/44), CCND1 gain in 45.4% cases (20/44), MYB loss relative to CEP6 in 25.0% cases (11/44), and CDKN2A homozygous deletion in 20.5% cases (9/44). For lesions with both in situ and invasive disease, FISH findings in these two components were similar. No gene alterations were detected in any of 36 benign acral naevi. In this study FISH exhibited sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of acral melanoma which allows its application as an auxiliary diagnostic test in acral melanocytic tumours.",

Common ICI toxicities have become familiar to clinicians; however, rare delayed toxicities remain challenging given the paucity of data with such presentations. We present the unique case of a 61-year-old with metastatic melanoma with two rare, delayed ICI-induced toxicities. After resection of a large symptomatic parietal metastases, this patient received two doses of combination ipilimumab and nivolumab. Five weeks following his second dose, he developed ICI-induced pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion and early signs of tamponade. Corticosteroids were not administered due to a concurrent cerebral abscess. Administration of colchicine, ibuprofen, judicious monitoring, and cessation of immunotherapy led to the complete resolution of the effusion over several weeks. Seven months following his last dose of immunotherapy, the patient developed ICI-associated grade four autoimmune encephalitis, presenting as status epilepticus. High-dose steroid initiation led to rapid clinical improvement. The patient remains in near-complete response on imaging with no recurrence of pericardial effusion and partial resolution of neurological symptoms. ICI-induced pericardial disease and encephalitis carry substantial mortality rates and prompt diagnosis and management is critical.

Clinically, extra-nodal disease is common including 10-15 % presenting with central nervous system (CNS) disease. Most PTLD cases are B cell (5-10 % T/NK cell or Hodgkin lymphoma), while over one-third are EBV-negative. World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic categories are: early lesions, polymorphic, and monomorphic PTLD; although in practice, a clear separation is not always possible. Therapeutically, reduction in immunosuppression remains a mainstay, and recent data has documented the importance of rituximab +/- combination chemotherapy. Therapy for primary CNS PTLD should be managed according to immunocompetent CNS paradigms. Finally, novel treatment strategies for PTLD have emerged, including adoptive immunotherapy and rational targeted therapeutics (e.g., anti-CD30 based therapy and downstream signaling pathways of latent membrane protein-2A).",
