Summary
Analysis
of
17
cases
of coexistent
sarcoidosis
and
malignant
lymphoproliferative
disease,
supplemented with 29 similar cases reported in the literature indicates that this association is not fortuitous.
In addition, significantly more malignancies other than lymphoma were found in this group of patients. A
sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome appears to exist in which malignant lympho-proliferative disease develops at
least 5.5 times more often than expected in middle-aged patients with chronic active sarcoidosis, possibly as a
consequence of the immunologic abnormalities observed in the latter disease.
Coexistence of sarcoidosis and malignant lympho-
proliferative
disease
(LD)
has
been
reported
sporadically for the last 50 years, but mostly during
the last two decades (Table I). The assessment of
such reports is difficult. While LD is usually easy to
verify,
the presence of true
sarcoidosis
is
often
difficult to prove, even when clinicoradiographic
findings compatible with sarcoidosis are supported
by histologic evidence of non-caseating epitheliod
cell granulomas (EPCG),
since
infectious agents
and tissue irritants may induce similar histologic
changes (Parkes, 1974; Sharma, 1984). Further, the
occasional occurrence of local sarcoid reactions in
LD, particularly in Hodgkin's disease, complicates
the issue (Kadin et
al.,
1971; Kim & Dorfman,
1974; Neiman, 1977). Thus, regardless of whether
sarcoidosis
is
presumed
before
or
after
the
verification of LD, it may be argued that the latter
disease is responsible for the occurrence of EPCG,
particularly if both diseases are primarily located to
the skin or the lymph nodes.
Under
these
circumstances
any
selection
of
reported cases of coexisting sarcoidosis and LD will
be the result of a personal judgement. Table
I
presents 29 cases which the author tends to regard
as genuine. However,
there are some additional
cases of LD localized to the skin in which it cannot
be determined whether the occurrence of EPCG in
the skin signifies concurrent sarcoidosis or a local
sarcoid reaction (Pautrier, 1938; Kissel et al., 1962;
Ackerman & Flaxman,
1970; Kahn et al.,
1974).
Further,
there
are
some
reports
in
which
coexistence of sarcoidosis and LD has been claimed
although it is more likely that mere local sarcoid
reactions
have
been
observed
(Hastings
&
Thompson, 1949; Wurm et al., 1958; Razis et al.,
1959).

Analysis of the 29 cases from Table
I reveals
three interesting features:
(i) With two exceptions
cases of LD have occurred after sarcoidosis with a
median interval of 24 months between the two
diseases.
This
indicates
a
possible
causal
relationship. (ii) The median age of the patients at
onset of sarcoidosis is 41 years which is 10 years
above the median age of unselected patients with
sarcoidosis (Horwitz et al., 1967). This is interesting
because a late onset of sarcoidosis is quite often
associated with a chronic active type of this disease.
(iii) Hodgkin's disease occurs more frequently than
expected if the association between sarcoidosis and
the various types of LD were merely fortuitous.
Taken
together,
the
three
features
mentioned
above
suggest
the
existence
of
a
sarcoidosis-
lymphoma syndrome which may evolve through an
immunological mechanism. In order to characterize
this proposed syndrome in more detail a further 17
cases of coexisting sarcoidosis and LD have been
collected and analyzed.
Material and methods
The
17
cases
of
coexistent
sarcoidosis
and
malignant LD (Table II) were found by following
anamnestic
indications
of preceding
sarcoidosis,
uncovered
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
of
the
malignancy. However, cases 1 and 2 presented with
Hodgkin's disease with lymph-node biopsies also
containing EPCG, and clinical signs of sarcoidosis
did
not
appear
until
5
and
17
years
later,
respectively. Cases 1 and 3 were kindly pointed out
to the author by other physicians, cases 4 and 5
surfaced
as
a
result of a nation-wide study of
Hodgkin's disease (Nordentoft
et
al.,
1980), and
cases 9 and
10 were found
as
a
result of an
epidemiological
study
of
2,544
patients
with
respiratory sarcoidosis (Brincker & Wilbek, 1974).
The remaining 11 cases were found by the author

H. BRINCKER
during routine clinical work over a 17-year period
in a department with a background population of
900,000 people, amounting to 18% of the Danish
population. Cases
1,
2,
3,
13 and 14 have been
published
previously
(Brincker,
1972)
and have
been deleted from Table I.
In
all
cases the patients' past hospital records
were procured and
scrutinized
carefully, and
all
information
on
sarcoidosis,
malignant LD
and
other malignant diseases was recorded. Whenever
indicated
previous
chest X-rays and histological
slides were reviewed. During this process additional
possible cases were excluded from the study because
they failed to meet the diagnostic criteria for either
sarcoidosis
or
malignant
LD.
In
all
of
the
remaining
17
cases
the
diagnosis
of lymphoid
malignancy was histologically confirmed, and in 14
of the cases the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based
on the demonstration of EPCG in biopsies as well
as the presence of a typical clinical picture. In cases
9, 10 and 15 the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made
on
clinical
grounds
alone
without
bioptic
confirmation. However, the clinical pictures were so
unequivocal that in the author's opinion all three
cases should be regarded
as bona fide
cases of
sarcoidosis (cf. Table III).
Results
Table
II gives the overall data on all 17 patients.
There were 9 females and 8 males, and their median
age at the onset of sarcoidosis was 41 years. There
were
8
cases of Hodgkin's
disease,
4 of
non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma,
3 of chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia, and 2 of paraproteinaemia. The mean
interval from onset of sarcoidosis (in cases
1 and 2
from
first
biopsy
with
EPCG)
to
histologic
verification
of malignant LD
was
125
months

(median

months).
The
mean
interval
from
sarcoidosis to malignant LD was 81 months for
Hodgkin's disease, 89 months for non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma,
169 months for chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia and 326 months for paraproteinaemia.
The longest interval was 31 5/12 years (case
17).
Five of the 9 deceased patients had autopsies (cases
4, 5, 6 12 and 14). Only in case 6 with the shortest
interval from onset of sarcoidosis to autopsy were
EPCG found at autopsy. In the remaining 4 cases
fibrotic changes were found
in lymph-nodes
or
lungs, consistent with old, healed sarcoidosis.
Table
III
summarizes
the
observed
clinical
manifestations of sarcoidosis.
Fifteen of the
17
cases had involvement of lung parenchyma or hilar
lymph-nodes, and in 9 cases the symptoms were
sufficiently severe to justify systemic corticosteroid
therapy.
Some
cases
healed
spontaneously
or
following therapy (cases 1, 9, 14, 16 and 17), but it
is remarkable that the remaining cases all had later
exacerbations
or
problems
due
to
progressive
pulmonary
fibrosis.
In
many
of
the
patients
sarcoidosis was diagnosed long ago when diagnostic
work-up
was
more
cursory
than
today.
Accordingly,
there were
too
few serum protein
determinations
(n = 6)
to
allow
a
meaningful
analysis. However, there were enough cell counts to
show that the median number of lymphocytes per
M1 of peripheral blood was only 1,056 (range, 303-
1,750) at the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, and only 864
later
at
the
diagnosis
of malignant LD.
These
figures are well below the lowest normal range.
Nine cases of associated neoplastic disease were
found, 7 of which were malignant tumours (Table
IV). Remarkably, these 9 cases occurred in only 5
patients. The case of acute myelocytic leukaemia
may have been iatrogenic, following 10 years of
chlorambucil treatment. Further, this patient had
had
several courses of 165KVX-ray therapy in
1942-43 because of furunculosis. Five of the
17
malignant tumours occurred after the diagnosis of
sarcoidosis and 2 before. The total number of cases
of malignant tumours expected to occur in all 17
patients was calculated both for the period of birth
to last date of observation and for the period of
onset of sarcoidosis
to
last day of observation,
using published Danish incidence figures (Danish
Cancer
Registry,
1982).
Table
V
shows
that
significantly more malignant tumours occurred than
expected (P= <0.05), regardless of the method of
calculation.

THE SARCOIDOSIS-LYMPHOMA SYNDROME
471
study, viz. that LD always occurs after sarcoidosis,
that the median age at onset of sarcoidosis is 10
years above that of unselected sarcoidosis patients,
and that Hodgkin's disease occurs more frequently
than expected.
The median interval from the onset of sarcoidosis
was almost 4 times longer than in the previously
reported cases, 95 versus 24 months. Whether this
interval is shorter in Hodgkin's disease and in non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma than in chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia and paraproteinaemia is uncertain due to
the
small number of cases. The
relatively long
interval
from
sarcoidosis
to LD
found
in
the
present
study
may
simply
reflect
the
author's
interest
in
following
up
anamnestic
leads
of
preceding
sarcoidosis
in lymphoma
patients.
In
none of the 17 cases did LD precede sarcoidosis.
Cases 1 and 2 of Table II are really no exception to
this rule since EPCG were demonstrated concomi-
tantly with LD although the clinical manifestations
of sarcoidosis did not appear until later.
The impression
that the sarcoidosis-lymphoma
syndrome is associated with a chronic active type of
sarcoidosis appears to have been confirmed by the
present study. Thus, the median age of the patients
was rather high (41 years as in previously reported
cases), they had long-term lymphopenia, 85% were
anergic, 53% had received corticosteroid treatment,
and 71% had signs of persistent disease activity.
These factors are usually associated with significant
immunologic abnormalities typical of sarcoidosis,
viz.
an
increased number
of T
helper
cells
in
granulomatous
tissues,
a
decreased
number
of
circulating T helper cells, and hyperactivity of the B
cell system (Daniele et al., 1980).
There were twice as many cases of Hodgkin's
disease
as
of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma
in
the
present study whereas the latter type of lymphoma
dominated among the previously reported cases (15
versus 10, Table I). The reason for this discrepancy
is not clear. In any case, Hodgkin's disease occurs
more frequently than expected. This agrees with a
previous epidemiological study of cancer incidence
in 2,544 patients with respiratory sarcoidosis. Here
6 cases of malignant lymphoma occurred against
0.52 cases expected.
Four cases were Hodgkin's
disease and 2 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Brincker
& Wilbek,
1974).
It
is puzzling why both
true
sarcoidosis and local sarcoid reactions should be
associated particularly with one type of LD (Kadin
et al., 1971; Kim & Dorfman, 1974; Neiman, 1977).
However, all combinations of sarcoidosis and LD
appear to occur (Tables I and II) with the possible
exception of acute lymphocytic leukaemia.
The finding of a significantly increased incidence
of various malignant tumours is at variance both
with
previously
reported
cases
and
with
the
aforementioned epidemiological study in which lung
cancer was the only malignancy apart from LD
occurring more frequently than expected with 9
cases
observed
versus
2.8
expected
(Brincker &
Wilbek,
1974).
It
is
interesting,
however,
that
whereas the median age
at onset of sarcoidosis
among all the 2,544 cases in the previous study was
30 years, it was 56 years in those 24 patients who
subsequently developed a malignant tumour other
than LD (unpublished observations). Thus, here as
in LD there is a suggestion that it is the chronic
active type of sarcoidosis developing in middle-aged
patients
which
is
associated
with
subsequent
development of malignant disease.
The chronology of sarcoidosis, LD and other
malignant
tumours
viewed
together
with
the
evidence
of immunological
abnormalities
in
the
patients
studied
(anergy, lymphopenia,
persistent
disease
activity)
makes
it
natural
to
look
for
immunological mechanisms behind the sarcoidosis-
lymphoma syndrome. It has long been known that
patients
with
congenital
or
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndromes
and
with
certain
immunoinflammatory
diseases
often
develop
lymphomas, and
it has been proposed that the
increased mitotic activity of lymphocytes increases
their risk of mutation and subsequent malignant
transformation, because a failure exists of feedback
mechanisms
to
regulate lymphocyte proliferation
(Louie & Schwartz, 1978). Since the mitotic activity
of lymphocytes appears to be increased
also- in
sarcoidosis
due
to
the
immune
inflammatory
response
in the involved tissues (Daniele
et
al.,
1980), sarcoidosis probably belongs to the group of
lymphoma-associated diseases mentioned. It is more
difficult
to
explain
the
increased
incidence
of
malignant tumours other than LD in sarcoidosis.
However, the depletion of circulating T helper cells
might lead to decreased tumour rejection (Vose &
Moore,
1985) or perhaps to decreased resistance
against oncogenic viruses. In this context it may be
significant that 6 of the 9 neoplasms found in the
patients studied (Table IV) and the excess cases of
lung cancer found in the previous study (Brincker
& Wilbek, 1974) originated from surface epithelium
of the respiratory tract, the skin, and the female
genital tract - all sites that are frequently exposed
to various carcinogenic stimuli.
Although the present study was not designed to
answer the question whether more cases of LD are
observed
in sarcoidosis than expected,
it allows
some
estimates
to be made. The prevalence of
sarcoidosis in Scandinavia has been found to be in
the range of 7.5-64/100,000, but it may be higher
(Sharma, 1984; Teirstein & Lesser, 1983). If we use
the upper figure of 64/100,000, the total number of
cases of sarcoidosis in Denmark (with a population
472
H. BRINCKER
of 5 million people) would be
3,200. The yearly
incidence of LD is about
1 in 5,000 - in other
words, 0.64 cases of LD should be expected to
occur yearly in patients with sarcoidosis as a result
of chance alone. Since 11 of the 17 patients in the
present study were collected over a 17-year period
from an underlying population representing 18% of
the Danish population, this corresponds to about
60 patients for the entire country over a 17-year
period, or 3.5 patients yearly. Thus, the observed
number of cases appears to be about 5.5 times the
expected number, which supports the hypothesis of
sarcoidosis as a predisposing factor for LD. The
5.5/1 ratio is lower than the 11.5/1 ratio found in
the
previous
epidemiological
study
(Brincker &
Wilbek,
1974), and the correct figure may lie in
between
since
both methods
of calculation
are
hampered by uncertainties.
In conclusion, a sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome
appears
to
exist
in
which
LD
and
other
malignancies develop more often than expected in
middle-aged
patients
with
chronic
active
sarcoidosis,
perhaps
as
a
consequence
of
the
immunologic abnormalities observed in the latter
disease.

The clinical course of bone metastases from breast cancer
R.E. Coleman & R.D. Rubens
ICRF Clinical Oncology Unit, GuY's Hospital, Londclon SE
9RT, UK.
Summary
All patients with carcinoma of the breast seen in this Unit since 1970 were reviewed to study the
incidence, prognosis, morbidity and response to treatment of bone metastases. The biological characteristics
of the primary tumour were compared in patients relapsing first in bone or liver.
Sixty-nine percent of patients dying with breast cancer had bone metastases and bone was the commonest
site of first distant relapse. Bone relapse was more common in receptor positive or well differentiated (grade
1) tumours.
The median survival was 24 months in those with disease apparently confined to the skeleton compared
with 3 monlhs after fiist relapse in liver.
Ten percent of patients with breast cancer developed hypercalcaemia. All had metastatic disease and 85%
had widespread
skeletal involvement.
Fifteen
percent of patients with
disease confined
to
the skeleton
developed hypercalcaemia.
The
response in bone
to primary endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy,
was apparently less than the
overall response achieved. A large proportion had apparently static disease reflecting the insensitivity of the
UICC assessment criteria. The duration of survival
in these patients was similar to responding patients,
suggesting a tumour response may occur in the absence of discernable radiological evidence of healing.
The majority of patients with advanced breast cancer have
evidence
of
skeletal
metastases
by
the
time
of
death
(Galasko,
1981).
Palliation
of symptoms,
control
of the
disease and evaluation
of specific
therapy
are important
issues
in
these
patients.
Bone
metastases
may
remain
asymptomatic
but
pain
is common
and
hypercalcaemia,
pathological fractures and leuco-erythroblastic anaemia may
occur.
Breast cancer has a variable and often long clinical course
and patients with bone metastases in particular frequently
have
a
protracted
illness.
Although
premature
death
is
inevitable,
remissions
are
frequent
and
patients
usually
require palliative therapy
- local radiotherapy and specific
systemic treatment - for many months or years.
Evaluating
response
in
bone
metastases
to
systemic
therapy
is often difficult. Objective assessment of response
by UICC criteria (Hayward et al., 1977) requires radiological
evidence
of healing
of
lytic
disease.
This
may
not
be
apparent for 4-6 months and is not a direct reflection of
changes
in
the tumour
load.
Clinical
trills
using UICC
criteria have usually reported lower response rates for bone
than
the
overall
response
rate
achieved
by
treatment
reflecting the insensitivity of assessment methods (Coleman
& Rubens, 1985).
During the past
15 years several thousand patients with
breast cancer have been treated in this Unit and we report
here
our
experience
of
the
problems
caused
by
bone
metastases.
Information
is
presented
on
clinical
course,
associated morbidity and the impact of systemic therapy in
palliation. Tumour characteristics associated with metastatic
disease in bone are analysed and a comparison is made with
patients
with
liver
metastases
who
usually
have
more
aggressive disease of shorter duration.
Patients and methods
A retrospective analysis of all patients with histologically
proven carcinoma of the breast attending
this Unit since
1970 has been made. Defined sub-sets have been selected to
enable
analysis
of
incidence,
morbidity,
prognosis
and
response to treatment of bone metastases and review the
biological
characteristics
of the primary tumour as
listed
below.

Incidence of metastases
Five hundred and eighty-seven
patients dying during the
period 1979-1984 were studied to determinerthe incidence of
bone
metastases
and
visceral
disease.
Additionally,
2240
patients presenting to this Unit over the past 10 years with
primary
breast
cancer
were
analysed
to
ascertain
the
distribution and relative frequency of first relapse.
Survival, complications and course after first relapse
A comparison of survival has been made in 498 patients with
first evidence of metastatic disease in the skeleton and 80
with first relapse in liver since 1975.
Analysis of subsequent complications and the distribution
of subsequent relapse at other sites was assessed in the 498
patients with first relapse in bone.
Tumour characteristics
A comparison of steroid
receptor
status and
histological
grade (infiltrating ductal tumours only) was made between
patients with first relapse in bone and those developing liver
metastases. Because first relapse in the liver is unusual, and
receptor
status and
histological grading were
not always
known,
all patients developing liver disease,
at any time,
were selected for these comparisons.
Hormonal status
Oestrogen receptor (ER)
status was measured
in
150/498
patients with first relapse in bone and 75 with relapse in the
liver. Progesterone receptor (PgR) status was measured in
110 patients with first relapse in bone and 60 with relapse in
the
liver. Steroid receptor analysis was by the method of
King et
al. (1979). A value >5 fmol mg- 1
cytosol protein
was considered positive.
Histological
grading of the primary tumour
using
the
method of Bloom and Richardson (1957) was known in 861
patients with metastatic disease. Ninety-five had grade
I (well-
differentiated),
464 grade
2
(intermediate
differentiation),
and 302 grade 3 (poorly differentiated) tumours.
Response to treatment
A comparison of overall response to treatment with that in
bone was made in 183 patients receiving primary endocrine
therapy,
of whom
112
had
bone
metastases,
and
126
patients, all with skeletal involvement, receiving a variety of
Br. J. Caticet- (1987), 55, 61-66
62
R.E. COLEMAN & R.D. RUBENS
chemotherapy
regimens.
The
time
to
progression
and
survival of patients with responding, static and progressive
disease were compared by Mantel-Cox log-rank
analysis.
Assessment of response was by UICC
criteria (Hayward
et al., 1977).
Hypercalcaemia
Hypercalcaemia was identified in 147 patients seen in this
Unit since
1975. The distribution of metastatic disease in
these patients, the frequency of skeletal involvement, and
prognosis have been assessed. Skeletal disease was considered
to be widespread if 5 or more foci of increased tracer uptake
were visible on bone scan with radiological confirmation of
at least one lesion. Minimal skeletal involvement implied
either lack of radiological confirmation or fewer than five
lesions
identifiable
on
the bone
scan. The
incidence
of
hypercalcaemia was determined in 1049 patients with breast
cancer who died in the decade 1975-1984.
Management of metastatic bone disease
A full blood count, biochemical screen, and chest radiograph
had been performed in all patients. Radionuclide bone scans
with
technetium
labelled
methylene
diphosphonate
were
performed in all patients whenever progressive disease was
suspected. Appropriate radiographs were taken of areas of
abnormal
tracer
uptake.
Radionuclide
liver
scans
were
performed in patients with hepatomegaly or liver function
abnormality.
Various systemic treatments have been used during the
time period of this study. These have followed a logical
sequence based on the knowledge of three variables. These
are: (1) the extent, pattern and aggressiveness of the initial
presentation of metastatic disease; (2) the menopausal status
of the
patient;
(3)
the hormone
receptor
status
of the
tumour. Hormone treatment has been the preferred initial
treatment, chemotherapy being used for patients failing to
respond to, or relapsing after, endocrine therapy. Exceptions
to this are patients with aggressive visceral disease and those
with hormone
receptor negative tumours when cytotoxic
chemotherapy is the initial treatment of choice (Figure 1).
Additional treatments were used for complications of bone
metastases. Hypercalcaemia was initially treated by intra-
venous rehydration with normal saline. Patients becoming
normocalcaemic
or remaining only mildly hypercalcaemic
commonly
received
oral phosphates
to maintain
control.
Those remaining hypercalcaemic were, until recently, treated
with mithramycin or calcitonin to inhibit bone resorption,
but now our present preferred agent for control of hyper-
calcaemia is 3 amino,l,hydroxypropylidene-l,l-bisphosphonate
(APD) (Coleman & Rubens, 1986).
To treat, or to reduce the risk of pathological fracture of a
long bone, internal fixation followed by radiotherapy was
performed. This usually relieved pain and provided optimum
conditions for callus formation and bony union. Spinal cord
compression was treated by surgical decompression
if the
signs
were
rapidly
progressing,
but
radiotherapy
was
preferred for slowly progressing, previously non-irradiated
sites of compression. Bone marrow infiltration causing leuco-
erythroblastic anaemia often occurred late in the course of
the disease and, when it had become resistant to hormones,
treatment was
by
cautious low dose chemotherapy and
haematological support.
Results
Incidence and prognosis of bone metastases
Bone was the most common site of metastatic disease. Four
hundred and eighty-five of 587 (69%) patients dying with
breast cancer in the 5 year period 1979-84 had radiological
evidence of skeletal metastases before death. In comparison
158
(27%)
had
lung
metastases,
and
157
(27%)
liver
metastases.
Bone was
also
the most common
site of first distant
relapse. In the past ten years 2240 patients have presented to
this Unit with primary
breast
cancer.
Six hundred and
eighty-one (30%) have relapsed after a median follow-up of
nearly 5 years. Two-hundred and forty-five relapses (36%)
were classified as local, 395 (58%) as distant and 41 (6%)
concurrent local and distant. One hundred and eighty-four
patients relapsed
first
in bone (47%
of all
first
distant
relapse).
Table

shows
the
distribution
and

or in liver was 57 years (range 29-79 and 29-78 years in

whom the overall
response rate was 32%, but response in
bone only 18%. The rate of progression overall and in bone
was similar at 27%. Apparently static disease in bone was
common (31%) and 24% of bony sites were unassessable,
because of either sclerotic appearance on X-ray, rapid extra-
skeletal progression, or lack of follow-up.
Sixty-eight
patients
had
both
osseus
and
non-osseus
metastases. Fourteen of 68 (21%) of the former and 27/68
(40%) of the latter showed objective response. The response
rate
in non-osseus sites was significantly higher (P= <0.02).
Similarly response in bone to chemotherapy appeared less
common
than
the
overall
response.
Thirty-seven
of
126
(29%)
patients,
all
with
bone
metastases,
treated
with
combination
chemotherapy
achieved
complete
or
partial
response.
Response
in bone
was
less
frequent with
18%
showing radiological evidence of healing (Table VI). A high
proportion of patients (47%) in this series also appeared to
have static bone disease.
The survival of patients with bone metastases receiving
primary endocrine therapy is shown in Figure 3. Responding
patients have the best prognosis with a median duration of
survival which exceeds 30 months compared with 7 months
in
non-responders
(P= <0.001).
There
is
no
significant
difference in survival between responding patients and those
with static disease although the trend
is in favour of those
showing objective
response.
This
suggests
that
a
tumour
response
may
occur
in
the
absence
of
discernable
radiological evidence of healing.

One
hundred
and
twenty-five
of
147
(85%!o) patients with hypercalcaemia had evidence of multiple
bone metastases. Twenty-two of 147 (15%) had minimal
or
no
evidence
of
skeletal
involvement
identified
by
either
radionuclide bone scan or X-ray.
Liver metastases were identified before
or
at the
time of
hypercalcaemia
in 68/147 patients (46%). Liver involvement
was
more
common
in
patients
with
little
or
no
skeletal
involvement (P<0.05) (Table VII). Eighty-six of 498 (17%)
of
patients
with
first
relapse
in
bone
developed
hyper-
calcaemia.
In those with metastatic disease confined
to the
skeleton
15%
subsequently
became
hypercalcaemic,
compared
with 31%
of 94
patients who
had
additional
spread to the liver (P<0.001). Patients with hypercalcaemia
have a poor prognosis despite active treatment. The median
survival
after
hypercalcaemia
is
3
months
(range
0-56
months) and
was similar
in patients with
or without
liver
metastases.
Pathological fracture of a long bone occurred
in 78/498
(16%)
patients
after
first
relapse
in
bone.
The
median
duration of survival after fracture was 12 months (range 0-
66
months).
Thirteen
of
498
developed
spinal
cord
compression with a median survival of 3 months (range 0-26
months) after this complication.
Discussion
Bone metastases are common in advanced breast cancer and
the
69%
incidence
of
radiologically
confirmed
skeletal
metastases here is in accordance with the 47-85%
incidence
reported
in autopsy
series (Gelasko,
1981).
Lung
or
liver
metastases
were each
identified
before
death
in 27%
of
women dying with breast cancer. This however
is less than
the 57-77%
and 50-71%
incidence of disease
in lung and
liver respectively reported in autopsy series (Di Pietro ct
a/.,
1976) indicating relatively frequent asymptomatic disease
aIt
these sites as well as reflecting the insensitivity of clinical and
imaging techniques for detecting disease in these organs.
Bone is also the commonest site of first distant relapse of
breast cancer (McNeil, 1984). In this study bone was the first
site of distant relapse in 47% and viscera (liver, lung, pleura)
in 25%. Despite the relative frequency of bone relapse this
occurred in only 8% of 2240 patients presenting to this Unit
with
primary
breast
cancer.
This
low
incidence
in
an
unselected
population
helps
explain
why
routine
bone
scanning in the follow-up of early breast cancer
is not cost
effective (Lee, 1985).
Age and disease free interval were similar in patients with
first relapse in either bone or in liver. Relapse in liver was
not more common
in pre-menopausal
patients
despite
the
tendency for lower receptor values in this group (Croton et
al.,
1981).
Metastatic
bone
disease,
unlike
liver
disease,
frequently followed a protracted clinical course. The median
duration of survival was 24 months in patients with disease
apparently confined to the skeleton.
This
study
confirms
that
bone
metastases
are
more
common
in
well
differentiated
receptor
positive
tumours,
while
liver
metastases
are
more
frequent
with
receptor
negative anaplastic tumours (Elston et al., 1980).
Clinical trials in the treatment of breast cancer using the
UICC
criteria
of
response
have
usually
reported
lower
reponse
rates
for bone
lesions
than
the
overall
response
(Stewart
et
al.,
1982).
Possibly
this
could
be
a
true
phenomenon if bone metastases are biologically different and
relatively refractory
to treatment, but
it seems more likely
that the difference is apparent rather than real because of the
insensitivity of assessment methods. Indeed
the association
between
bone
metastases
and
receptor
positive,
well
differentiated tumours would predict a high response rate.
This
underestimation
of
response
to
both
primary
endocrine therapy and chemotherapy was also seen
in
this
study. The incidence of progressive disease was similar, but
the proportion of patients with non-assessable or apparently
stable disease was higher in bone. Survival from the start of
endocrine
treatment
was
similar
in
patients
with
either
objective response or stable disease.
We are currently evaluating alternative response
criteria
including
radionuclide
bone
scanning,
biochemical
parameters of bone metabolism and subjective assessment.
Preliminary
results
show
that
prediction
of
objective
response within 3-4 weeks of starting treatment
is possible
(Coleman et al., unpublished data).
Morbidity from bone metastases was common. Twenty-
nine
percent
of
patients
with
first
relapse
in
bone
subsequently developed one or more of the major compli-
cations
of bone
destruction,
hypercalcaemia,
pathological
fracture
and
spinal
cord
compression.
The
prognosis
of
patients with hypercalcaemia was poor with a median dura-
tion of survival of 3 months but prolonged remissions up
to
56
months
are
seen.
Better
prediction
of impending
pathological
fracture
and
early
orthopaedic
intervention
might reduce the frequency of this unpleasant complication.
This review of a single Unit's large experience of patients
with
bone
metastases
treated
by
a
logical
sequence
of
treatments
has
presented
data
on
various
clinical
and
pathological
aspects
of
metastatic
bone
disease.
It
has

THE FREQUENCY OF M-COMPONENTS IN SERA OF PATIENTS
WITH SOLID MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS
A. TALERMAN AND W. G. HAIJE
From the Departnents of Path,ology and Chemiiical Pathology, Institute of Radiotherapy,
Rotterdamn, Holland
Received 29 November 1972.
Accepted 19 Janutiary 1973
Summary.-The frequency of M -components was studied by agar gel electrophoresis
in sera from 807 patients, 467 (570,,) females and 340 (4301) males with histologically
proven solid malignant neoplasms.
M -components were found in the sera of 40 male and 20 female patients.
Apart
from two known cases of multiple myeloma and one case of Waldenstrom's macro-
globulinaemia, none of the patients were found to be suffering from these diseases.
The frequency of M-components increased with age, and this was more evident in
males.
Twenty-two of 60 patients with M-components did not exhibit abnormalities
on immunoelectrophoresis.
Of the 35 remaining patients, 27 had an abnormal
component of the IgG class, 6 of the IgA and 2 of the IgM class.
M-components
were found in the sera of patients with a wide variety of neoplasms.
There appeared
to be no evidence of an increased frequency of M-components in the sera of patients
with solid malignant neoplasms compared with normal adult population.
M-COMPONENTS are monoclonal immu-
noglobulins which
can be
identified
as
discrete homogenous proteins on eleetro-
phoresis of serum and urine.
They are
considered by
structural
criteria
to be
normal immunoglobulins, although they
are
still often referred to as
"" parapro-
teins "".
Until
recent
years
the
finding
of
M-components in the serum was consid-
ered to be almost exclusively associated
with multiple myeloma, or WAaldenstr6m's
macroglobulinaemia. However, with more
widespread use
of electrophoretic
tech-
niques, M-components have been demon-
strated in sera from patients who in spite
of thorough investigation did not appear
to
be
suffering
from
either
of
these
diseases, and who did not develop them
when
followed
up
for
a
considerable
period of time (Waldenstrom, 1964; Zaw-
adzki and Edwards,
1967; Migliore and
Alexanian,
1968;
Axelsson and
Hallen,
1972).
More recently, the incidence of M-com-
ponents has been studied in the sera of
normal healthy adult population and in
different age groups (Hallen, 1963; Fine,
Derycke and Boffa, 1965; Axelsson, Bach-
mann and Hallen,
1966; Axelsson and
Hallen,
1972).
During
the
last
two
decades M-components have been detected
in
the
sera
of patients
suffering from
malignant
lymphoma
(Azar,
Hill
and
Osserman, 1957; Krauss and Sokal, 1966;
Moore et al., 1970), other forms of malig-
nant disease (Osserman and Takatsuki,
1963; Hallen, 1966; Causey, 1967; Hosley,
1967; Migliore and Alexanian, 1968), and
some non-malignant diseases (Owen, Pit-
ney
and
O'Dea,
1959;
Waldenstrom,
1964;
Michaux
and
Heremans,
1969;
Kanoh, 1970).
In view of the fact that M-components
have
been
observed
in
patients
with
malignant
diseases,
it
was
decided
to
study
their
frequency
in
the
sera
of patients
with
histologically proven
solid malignant neoplasms attending our
Institute.

THE FREQUENCY OF M-COMPONENTS IN SERA OF PATIENTS
MATERIAL AND METHODS
During a period of 13 months from March
1970 to April 1971 all new patients attending
our Institute had a specimen of blood taken
for electrophoretic examination.
The popu-
lation studied consisted of all new patients
with proven malignant disease
(both out-
patients and in-patients), except for those
with cutaneous neoplasms and leukaemia.
At the same time all histological preparations
relating
to
these
patients
were
reviewed
independently.
When the histological mat-
erial was found to be unsatisfactory and better
preparations could not be obtained, the case
was excluded from the study.
All sera were screened for the presence
of M-components by agar gel electrophoresis
using the method of Wieme (1959).
Every
specimen of serum which showed appear-
ances suggesting the presence of an M-compo-
nent was investigated further.
This invest-
igation consisted of immunoelectrophoresis
of the serum using the method of Schei-
degger (1955).
At the same time the elec-
trophoresis on agar gel was repeated, and the
presence of an M-component in this specimen
was a prerequisite for considering the serum

of
patients

All M-components encountered
were included.
The results showed that the sera examined
exhibited 3 possible patterns, namely (1) a
strong precipitation line, consistent with the
presence
of a monoclonal immunoglobulin
("" paraprotein "");
(2) a pattern which
al-
though it did not exhibit a definite "" para-
protein "" showed certain abnormalities, which
were considered to be suspect; and
(3) a
pattern free from any abnormalities (Fig. 1).

Serum
electrophoresis
revealed
the
presence of M-components in 60 patients:
40
males
and
20
females.
The
age
distribution of these patients is shown in
Fig. 2.
The frequency of M-components
was found to increase with age, and this
was more evident in males (Table II).
Two patients with multiple myeloma
and
one
patient
with
Waldenstrom's
macroglobulinaemia diagnosed during the
period under study were included.
No
other patient showed evidence of being
affected by these diseases, and a special
attempt was made to exclude this possi-
bility in the patients with M-components
in the serum.
Of the 60 patients with M-components
11, including
2 with multiple myeloma
and
one
with
Waldenstrom's
macro-
globulinaemia,
were
found
to
have
a
"" paraprotein ""
(Fig.
1(a)).
The typing
of these immunoglobulins was as follows:
7 IgG (6 kappa and 1 lambda), 3 IgA and
1 IgM.
Twenty-four patients were found to
have a "" suspect "" pattern (Fig. 1(b)). The
typing of these immunoglobulins was as
follows: 20 IgG, 3 IgA and 1 IgM. Twenty-
two patients with M-components in the
serum were found to have no abnormali-
ties on immunoelectrophoresis (Fig. 1(c)).
In
all these patients the M-components
were weak.
In 3 patients with M-com-
ponents, immunoelectrophoresis was not
performed;
in
all
3
the M-component
present formed a weak band.
M-components were found in the sera
of patients with a wide variety of neo-
plasms (Table I).
An increased frequency
of M-components was found in patients
with carcinomata of the lung and urinary
bladder.
Twenty-one patients whose sera
contained an M-component were dead by
the end of the period under study.
DISCUSSION
This investigation was undertaken as a
screening study in order to determine the
frequency of M-components in the sera
of patients with solid malignant neoplasms
and to
see whether there
is a
specific
pattern.
The patients attended a hospital
concerned mainly with radiation therapy
and the study may therefore suffer from
a
number
of disadvantages
associated
with
this
type
of
investigation.
The
patient population studied is thus selec-
ted in the way that patients with neo-
plasms which are treated by radiotherapy
predominate.
In
order
to
avoid
any
further selection,
all patients with neo-
plastic
disease
attending
the
hospital
during
the
period
under
study
were
included,
except
those
with
cutaneous
neoplasms and leukaemia.
This explains
the inclusion of patients with multiple
myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglo-
bulinaemia, diseases normally associated
with the presence of M-components.
A
considerable
number
of
patients
with
malignant lymphoma, a group of diseases
which is known to be sometimes associated
with the presence of M-components (Azar
et
al.,
1957;
Krauss and
Sokal,
1966;
Moore et al., 1970) were also included.
In
order to determine their significance all
M-components observed in the sera of the
patients studied were included.
The fre-
quency of M-components in the present
study (700%)
is very much higher than
that observed by Migliore and Alexanian
(1968), who found an incidence of 0-65 %
studying
a
similar
population,
except
that patients with cutaneous neoplasms
and a small number with benign neo-
plasms were included.
Although this can
be attributed partly to the inclusion of
all M-components as detected by a sensi-
tive
technique,
even
the
frequency
of
280
THE FREQUENCY OF M-COMPONENTS IN SERA OF PATIENTS
"" paraproteiiis "" in the present study is
higher (10%).
If all the cases with immunoelectro-
phoretic abnormalities are included, the
frequency is 4 0%.
Among the patients
with M-components
there
was
a
male
predominance of nearly 2:
1
(1 85: 1),
although female patients made up 57 %
of patients in the present study.
There
was a similar male predominance (1 75: 1)
among the patients with M-components
studied by Migliore and Alexanian (1968),
whose patient populatioin was composed
of 56% female patients.
In a study to
determine the frequency of M-components
in a normal adult population Axelsson
et al. (1966) found a male predomiinance
of 12: 1
in a population consisting of
51 % females and a frequency of 0 9 %,
using a less sensitive technique than that
used in the present study or by Migliore
and Alexanian (1968).
Axelsson's results
(1966)
are
thus
higher
than
those
of
Migliore and Alexanian
(1968) and are
probably similar to those observed in the
present study, as the frequency of M-com-
ponents in their study is similar to the
frequency
of
""paraproteins""
in
the
present study.
Our
results support
the findings
of
Hallen (1963), Fine et al. (1965), Axelsson
et
al.
(1966),
and
Finie,
Lambin
and
Leroux
(1972), who have reported that
the incidence of M-components increases
with age.
In the present study, in 22 out of 60
patients with M-components in the serum
there were no abnormalities on immuno-
electrophoresis.
In
all
these
cases
the
M-components were found to be weak,
and there appears to be a relationship
between the intensity of the M-component
and the presence or absence of immuno-
electrophoretic
abnormalities.
The
M-
components which were found were mostly
of the IgG class, but a number of M-com-
ponents of the IgA and one of the IgM
class were also encountered, the patients
with
multiple
myeloma
and
Walden-
strom's macroglobulinaemia having been
excluded.
These
results
are
similar
to
the findings of Waldenstrom (1964), Axels-
son et al. (1966), Hallen (1966) and Fine
(1970).
Migliore
and
Alexanian
(1968)
in their study did not encounter M-com-
ponents
of the IgA
class, whereas the
majority of the M-components found in
patients with malignant neoplasms studied
by Kanoh (1970) were of this class.
This
shows that there
is no specific pattern
in
the
immunoelectrophoretic
results
obtained by different investigators.
An important difference between the
M-components
encountered
in
multiple
myeloma,
Waldenstrom's
macroglobuli-
naemia
and
some
cases
of
malignant
lymphoma, and those observed in patients
with other neoplasms, non-neoplastic dis-
eases and in the normal population is the
intensity of the abnormal band and the
concentration of the M-component in the
serum.
While in the former conditions
the
concentration
of the M-component
is usually relatively high and shows a
gradual increase, in the latter it is usually
low, producing a weak band and showing
no significant rise when followed up over
a long period of time (Migliore and Alexa-
nian, 1968; Axelsson and Hallen,
1972).
There appears to be no uniform or specific
pattern
as
far
as
the
location
of the
malignant
neoplasms
in
patients
with
M-components
is
concerned,
and
neo-
plasms
of many
different
organs have
been encountered.
Osserman and Takat-
suki (1963) found that in their 31 patients
the tumours were located mainly in t>e
large intestine, nasopharynx and biliary
tract.
In the series reported by Migliore
and Alexanian (1968) the most common
sites were the breast, lungs, upper respira-
tory tract and large intestine.
The num-
ber of patients with different neoplasms
included in their study was not stated and
therefore the actual frequency cannot be
ascertained.
Review
of
the
literature
failed to reveal any studies in which such
information was given.
In the present
study, M-components were found in the
sera of patients with neoplasms of many
different organs.
There was an increased
frequency in patients with carcinoma of
281
282
A. TALERMAN AND W. G. HAIJE
the lung and urinary bladder.
This find-
ing may
be
of
interest,
although
its
significance is not certain.
It has been stated by Hallen (1966)
that the incidence of M-components in
patients with malignant neoplasms, with
the exception of multiple myeloma, Wal-
denstrom's
macroglobulinaemia
and
malignant lymphoma, is not higher than
in normal Swedish population.
Migliore
and Alexanian
(1968) have stated that
there
is
no
evidence
of an
increased
frequency of M-components in sera from
patients with malignant neoplasms com-
pared with a normal adult population.
Although the results of the present
study
indicate
that
the
frequency
of
M-components in sera from patients with
malignant neoplasms is higher than that
found by Migliore and Alexanian (1968),
there appears to be no evidence that it is
higher than in a normal adult population.

THE INCIDENCE OF MALIGNANT TUMOURS IN PATIENTS
WITH RESPIRATORY SARCOIDOSIS
H. BRINCKER AND E. WILBEK
From the Radium Centre, Odense Hospital, and the Danish Institute of Clinical Epidemiology
(the Danish Tuberculosis Index), Copenhagen
Received 28 September 1973.
Accepted 26 November 1973
Summary.-During the period 1962-71 a total of 2544 patients with respiratory
sarcoidosis were reported to the Danish Institute of Clinical Epidemiology.
Among
them 48 patients developed a malignant tumour, the follow-up period ending on
31 December 1971.
Only 33-8 cases of cancer were expected if sarcoidosis patients
had had the same rates as the general population; the difference between the expected
and
observed number
is
statistically
significant
(0.02 > P > 0.01).
Malignant
lymphomata occurred
11 times and lung cancer 3 times more frequently than
expected.
For all other forms of cancer taken together, there was no significant
difference between the expected and the observed number of cases.
The increased cancer incidence may result from immunological deficiencies in
patients with sarcoidosis.
ACCORDING to the theories of immuno-
logical surveillance in the human body, an
intact immune apparatus
is one of the
conditions necessary to prevent or limit
the development of malignant tumours.
Thus
a
certain number
of
congenital,
idiopathic
or iatrogenic disturbances of
the immune apparatus are known to be
associated with an increased incidence of
cancer, particularly of malignant lympho-
mata
(Keast,
1970;
Doll
and
Kinlen,
1970).
Since
various
immunological
distur-
bances
usually
accompany
sarcoidosis
(Chase, 1966), it might be reasoned that
this disease could be associated with an
increased incidence of malignant tumours,
but studies of the incidence of malignancies
in large series of sarcoidosis patients have
apparently
not
been
published.
Case
histories which show an association be-
tween sarcoidosis and malignant lympho-
mata or lung cancer have been reviewed by
Brincker (1972) and Sakula (1963).
These
studies did not allow estimation of the
frequency of the association of sarcoidosis
with a malignancy.
However, in Brinc-
ker's study (1972) 5 cases of true sarcoi-
dosis were found in about 1500 cases of
malignant lymphoma.
This rate is very
high in view of the fact that sarcoidosis
occurs with an incidence of 5 per 100,000
in the general population (Horwitz, 1967;
Horwitz, Payne and Wilbek, 1967).
It
seems
remarkable
that
sarcoidosis
has
been diagnosed before malignant disease
in all recorded instances of this association.
The above observations suggest the
possibility of an increased incidence of
malignancies in patients with sarcoidosis.
The
present
study was
undertaken
in
order to test this hypothesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Background.-Since 1962 all new cases of
respiratory sarcoidosis diagnosed in Danish
chest clinics have been reported to a central
registry in The Danish Institute of Clinical
Epidemiology (DICE) (previously the Danish
Tuberculosis
Index).
This material
repre-

H. BRINCKER AND E. WILBEK
sents most cases of sarcoidosis diagnosed in
Denmark,
but
a
certain
reporting
deficit
exists as some patients are diagnosed and
treated in hospital departments other than
the chest clinics and hence are not reported to
the central register.
The true size of this
deficit is unknown but spot checks indicate a
figure between 17 and 31 per cent (Alsbirk,
1964; R0mer et al., 1973).
The unreported
cases probably represent more severe sympto-
matic forms of the disease.
Clinical and epidemiological data of the
sarcoidosis patients reported to DICE have
been described in detail elsewhere (Horwitz
et al., 1967).
The sex ratio was 1: 1, the
median age 32 years.
Half of the patients
had only involvement of the hilar lymph
nodes; the other half had a pulmonary lesion
with or without hilar involvement.
Since
1943
all new
cases of malignant
tumours diagnosed in Denmark should have
been reported to the Danish Cancer Registry.
The
percentage
of deaths
being
recorded
from death certificates only had dropped to
8 in 1959, but there is no reporting deficit for
cancer deaths since all death certificates are
matched
against
the
files
of the
Cancer
Registry.
There is no reason to believe that
the reporting deficit is greater than 8 per cent
in non-fatal disease.
Since the latter patients
represent only 25-30 per cent of the total
cases, the combined reporting deficit for all
cancer cases presumably does not exceed 2-
2-4 per cent.
The activities of the Danish
Cancer Registry have been described in detail
elsewhere (Clemmesen, 1965).
During the decade 1962-71, 2561 newly
diagnosed cases of respiratory sarcoidosis were
reported to the
central
register.
In Sep-
tember 1972 all the notifications were match-
ed against the files of the Cancer Registry in
order to see which sarcoidosis patients had a
record in the Cancer Registry.
All cases of
cancer which had occurred before 1 January
1972 were registered and from
the search
through the records
it was found that 65
patients had been registered with a malignant
disease.
In 17 patients the tumour was demon-
strated before the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and
they were therefore excluded.
In the
re-
maining
48
patients
the malignancy was
diagnosed
simultaneously
with,
or
after,
sarcoidosis and the present study consists of
those patients.
The basic population thus
consists of 2544 patients (1292 males and 1252
females) with sarcoidosis, who had not had
cancer previously.
Table I shows the distribution of the 48
cancer cases by diagnosis; none of the patients

had more than one malignant disease.
The
number of men and women was fairly equal
(26 and 22 respectively).
Apart from cancer
of the
female
reproductive
system,
lung
cancer represents a marked sex difference as
8
of the
9
cases
occurred
in men.
The
remainder were 13 cases of urogenital cancer,
8 cases of cancer of the digestive tract, 7 cases
of skin cancer,
7 cases of malignancies of
lymph nodes and thymus and 4 cases of
breast cancer.
In order to calculate the expected number
of cancer cases, the sarcoidosis patients were
broken down by year of report,
i.e., those
reported in 1962, 1963 etc.; within each of
these groups, the patients were split by sex
and age.
The sex and age specific incidence
of cancer in the Danish general population
(average for 1963-67) was applied to each of
these cells.
Although the entire observation
period 1962-71 is not covered by the 1963-67
cancer incidence rates, the latter were used
for the calculations because they represent the
latest available Danish figures (Clemmesen.
1973, personal communication).
The expect-
ed number depends, of course, on the length
of the period at risk.
The onset of this period
248
MALIGNANT TUMOURS IN PATIENTS WITH RESPIRATORY SARCOIDOSIS
was reckoned from the year that the sarcoi-
dosis was reported in the register, and runs up
to 1 January 1972; the period was thus on an
average 91 years for those reported in 1962,
81 years for those reported in 1963 and so on,
until for those reported in 1971 it was half a
year.
When
the
calculations
were made,
regard was also paid to the factor that the
patient's age increased during the period of
observation.
The expected number of all
forms of cancer taken together was calculated
but special estimates were made for lung
cancer and malignant lymphoma, based on
the respective rates for the two diseases.
The following formula has been used to
calculate the significance levels:
=x/n
p
1/2n
V/p(l
p)/n
where
x = number of cancer cases observed
p = expected cancer morbidity
n = number
of
observation
years.
n = 12,240
person-years in the calculations covering
all
10 years of observation, and 8065 person-years
in
the
calculations
covering
only
the
first
4 years of observation.
No review was made of the case records in
order to check the diagnosis of any of the 48
patients
who
had
both
sarcoidosis
and
cancer; a rejection of the diagnosis in one or
more of these cases would merely result in a
statistically unacceptable alteration in the
basis for the calculations.
RESULTS
Table II shows that 48 cases of cancer
were observed, whereas only 33.8 cases
were expected.
This difference is statisti-
cally significant (0-02 >P > 0 01).
The
higher incidence
is due primarily to an
increased
number
of
cases
in
males,
particularly of lung cancer.
Nine cases of
lung cancer were found but only 2-8 cases
were expected; this difference
is highly
significant
(P < 0 001).
Six
cases
of
malignant lymphoma
occurred whereas
only 0 5 cases were expected;
this dif-
ference
is
also
highly
significant
(P < 0 001).
With regard to
all other
forms of cancer, there
is no significant
difference between the expected and the
observed number of cases (30.5 cases vs
33).
Table
III shows that the expected
number of cancer cases goes down with
lapse of time.
This results from the fact
that only the patients reported in 1962
had
up
to
10
years
follow-up;
those
reported
in
1962 + 1963
had
9
years
follow-up; those reported in 1962 + 1963
+ 1964 had
8 years follow-up
etc.
In
other words, the number of patients at risk
is high for short intervals and decreases
the
longer
the
interval
becomes.
The
expected
incidence
goes
up
gradually
because the patients' age increases during
the observation period; hence the risk of
cancer also increases.
It is striking that
the observed cancer incidence is very high
during the first 4 follow-up years; there-
after it drops to the normal level or per-

haps a little lower.
In other words, an
excess morbidity exists only in the first
4 years after sarcoidosis was diagnosed.
During this period, 38 cases of cancer were
observed whereas only
21-2
cases
were
expected; the difference is highly signifi-
cant (P < 0-001).
DISCUSSION
The diagnosis of respiratory sarcoidosis
is beset with some uncertainty.
A posi-
tive Kveim reaction is confirmative but the
test is used only to a limited extent in
Denmark.
A number of other diseases
which
present
similar
roentgenological
findings may therefore be confused with
sarcoidosis and be reported.
As a
con-
sequence one might expect that some cases
of lung cancer and malignant lymphomata
would
be
reported
to DICE
under
a
diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
When the true
nature of the disease became evident, then
the case would be reported to the Cancer
Registry.
Conversely, true
cases of sar-
coidosis may be reported to the Cancer
Registry as, say, lung cancer or malignant
lymphomata.
However, this possibility is
considerably less likely to occur because
most
cases of cancer
are verified histo-
logically, whereas only about half of the
sarcoidosis
cases
are
verified
by

associations of sarcoidosis and cancer, or
whether these cases
or some of them
represent a mistaken diagnosis of one or
both diseases.
The likelihood of a genuine
association is greater the longer the inter-
val
between
the
time
of diagnosis
of
sarcoidosis and the time of diagnosis of
cancer.
In 4 of the 9 cases of lung cancer
more than one year passed; in 4 of the 6
cases of malignant lymphomata more than
2 years passed between the two diagnoses.
These
8
cases probably represent
true
associations.
In 4 of the 5 patients where
lung cancer was diagnosed during the first
year after the diagnosis of sarcoidosis,
biopsies are available showing both non-
caseating epithelioid cell granulomata and
tumour tissue.
Similarly, in one of the
2 patients in whom malignant lymphoma
was diagnosed within the first year after
sarcoidosis, a biopsy also containing non-
caseating
epithelioid
cell
granulomata
exists.
On the basis of these data (the time
intervals and the biopsy findings), at least
8 of the 9 cases of lung cancer and 5 of the
6 cases of malignant lymphomata appear
to represent genuine associations of sar-
coidosis and
cancer.
Still,
it must be
borne in mind that sarcoid reactions may
be seen in lymph nodes from patients with
lung cancer (Sakula, 1963) or malignant
lymphomata (Brincker, 1972); this reac-
tion should not be considered as sarcoidosis
disease.
Ifwe assume that patients with respira-
250
MALIGNANT TUMOURS IN PATIENTS WITH RESPIRATORY SARCOIDOSIS
251
tory sarcoidosis really have an increased
frequency of lung cancer and malignant
lymphomata, it is natural to ask why this
is so. As regards lung cancer, the chronic
pulmonary changes caused by sarcoidosis
may
act
as an
additional
carcinogenic
stimulus; it may also be that these changes
lead to a decreased resistance to other
carcinogenic stimuli.
The increased inci-
dence
of
malignant
lymphomata
may
result
from
the
immunological
defects
often noted in sarcoidosis patients; this is in
line
with
the
increased
incidence
of
malignant lymphomata
in patients who
have immunological defects (Keast, 1970;
Doll and
Kinlen,
1970).
Some
of the
sarcoidosis
patients
were
treated
with
corticosteroids
but
since
details
of the
treatment are not known in the central
register,
it cannot be determined what
influence the steroid therapy may have
had on the cancer incidence.
Since the present study
is based on
information from matching between two
central
registries,
the question may be
posed whether or not the incidence of
malignant
tumours
in
the
sarcoidosis
patients is too low because of a reporting
deficit.
As
mentioned
previously,
the
reporting deficit concerning the malignant
disease is negligible and plays no role.
As
regards sarcoidosis, the moderate reporting
deficit might
at
first sight seem of no
importance since the basis of the study is
those cases which were in fact reported.
However, the most severe cases of sarcoi-
dosis are probably not reported to DICE as
they are treated only in the medical de-
partments.
The present series is therefore
likely to be dominated by the findings in
mild,
non-symptomatic
cases.
Such
patients may have higher immunity and
therefore also a lower cancer risk, if the
incidence of malignant tumours
is pro-
portional to the degree of the immuno-
logical defect, and hence also the severity
of the sarcoidosis.
As the mild cases con-
stitute about half of the present series,
this
might
explain why
the
increased
incidence of cancer was confined to lung
cancer and malignant lymphomata.
This
hypothesis is supported by the fact that
patients with symptomatic sarcoidosis had
an observed cancer incidence which was
1-5 times higher than expected; among the
non-symptomatic cases the ratio was only
1*2 times higher (see Table II).
Thus, this
fact
also supports the assumption and
previously quoted data indicating that a
genuine association exists between cancer
and sarcoidosis.

mesen and his staff at the Danish Cancer
Registry for tracing the 2561 patients with
sarcoidosis

Registry.

BENIGN CLEAR CELL (""SUGAR"") TUMORS OF THE LUNGt
There exist in the lung primary benign tumors that at first glance resemble
metastases from hypernephroid tumors of the kidney. To date only an ab-
stract of the first report dealing with the first four examples and a brief
descriptive note have been published.""' From a more recent study of twelve
of these tumors, criteria have emerged that enable the differentiation from
other neoplasms to be made on the basis of routine histological preparations.
Correct identification should spare the patient uncomfortable and costly
diagnostic procedures, and should provide the solace of a good prognosis.
Indeed, it was the fact that extensive diagnostic procedures proved to be
without result after they had been undertaken on the basis of a mistaken
diagnosis that soon led to a more accurate definition of these tumors. Both
cellular and stromal characteristics identify these benign neoplasms. The
cells contain immense quanitities of glycogen, while fat is essentially absent.
Mitoses are exceedingly rare. There is no necrosis and the blood supply is
by way of abundant large, thin-walled channels.
Clinical and radiographic features
Some clinical and anatomical features are recorded in Table 1. There is
an almost equal sex distribution, five of the twelve patients being male.
Nine of the patients ranged in age from 45 to 59 years when they came to
surgery. The oldest was a woman of 64 and two of the patients were men
aged 28 and 29 respectively.
None of the patients had complaints that could clearly be related to the
tumors. There was no hemoptysis nor production of sputum. The lesions
were detected in what were essentially routine chest films in 8 of the 12
patients. One of these (Case 8) had had multiple bladder tumors which had
been treated successfully. Another (Case 9) had cystitis, and a ureteral
stone was demonstrated. In one patient (Case 2) a shadow was noted in the
right lower lobe in 1945 and interpreted as postpneumonic scarring. This
persisted following several additional episodes of pneumonia, the last of
which was 2y2 months before the right lower lobectomy was performed in

1960. Two patients had chest pain. One (Case 3) complained of pain in the
chest wall, but on the side contralateral to the tumor. Epigastric distress and
chest pain were the complaints for the investigation of which roentgeno-
grams were made in Case 12. One woman (Case 5) complained of low back
pain. Thus it may be concluded that these tumors are essentially silent.
There were no significant findings upon physical examination. None of
the tumors could be visualized bronchoscopically.
Radiographically the tumors were rounded or ovoid, smoothly contoured,
peripheral parenchymal masses (Figs. 1-3). Only one gave a suggestion of
notching (Fig. 4). They appeared to be homogeneous, without evidence of
cavitation or calcification. There was no specific lobar distribution (Table 1).
Only fragmentary information is available on the rate of development of
the lesions. In Case 4 the lesion was said to have been ""considerably small-
er"" six months before it was removed, but this suggestion of rapid growth
must be unusual. A pulmonary density corresponding to that of the tumor
may have been present 15 years before it was resected in Case 2. Review of
chest films in Case 8 indicated the presence of the tumor two, and possibly
five, years before its resection, and the interval was three years in Case 8
and eight years in Case 7.
In none of the patients was there evidence of a primary tumor elsewhere
than in the lung, except in Case 8 whose bladder papillomas have been men-
tioned. These had been treated by local irradiation, and there was no evi-
dence of a bladder tumor at the time the chest shadow was discovered. The
tumor in the lungs bore no resemblance to that in the bladder. Six of the
patients had intravenous pyelography; two of these six also had retrograde
pyelograms, three had renal aortograms, and one had a bilateral surgical
exploration of the kidney in unproductive attempts to find a primary source
for the intrapulmonary clear cell tumor. In Case 6 the kidney was thought
to be enlarged but intravenous and retrograde pyelograms and a renal
aortogram were negative. Another patient (Case 9) was thought to have a
renal calculus, but there was no evidence of renal tumor. Thus the urological
workup was essentially negative in demonstrating an intrarenal neoplasm
in all six patients in whom it was performed.
Lobectomy was performed in five patients, wedge resection in two, and
simple enucleation of the tumor in three, where the tumor was described
to ""shell-out"" easily during the operation. Precise information was not avail-
able regarding operative procedure in two of the patients.
There was no evidence of recurrence in five patients for whom chest
films were available at varying periods after operation-in one instance
seven years, in another three years, and in three patients two years after
operation. One of these patients had had simple enucleation of the lesion

(Case 5). These observations confirm the anatomical evidence of benignancy
of the lesion.
Gross appearance
All of the tumors were rounded or ovoid masses varying between 1.5 and
3 cm. in diameter at the time of resection, except for one (Case 9) which
measured 6.5 x 6.2 cm. The cut surface was translucent and varied in color
from pale pink to dark red, grey, or brown. In no instance was there evi-
dence of necrosis. None had the yellow color of some of the hypernephroid
tumors of the kidney. While not distinctly encapsulated, these masses were
described as soft and separating with greatest ease from the parenchyma
(Fig. 5). There was no evidence of involvement of a bronchus or major
vessel. Most of the tumors were considered to be in the peripheral portion
of the parenchyma, and although frequently within 2 cm. of the pleura, in
no instance involved that membrane.
Microscopic features
The microscopic appearance in H & E sections was distinctive and rather
uniform. The ""clear cells"" were arranged in masses and cords for the most
part supported by very little connective tissue (Fig. 6). By appropriate
staining and chemical analysis these cells were found to contain large quanti-
ties of glycogen. There was a rich blood supply in the form of large and
thin-walled vessels (Figs. 7 & 8). It is this type of blood supply that at once
provides the clue that the tumor is primary in the lung rather than a meta-
static hypernephroid tumor, which in considerable part is supplied by thick-
walled arteries.
In these tumors the sinusoidal vessels were very large in some fields and
less conspicuous in others. In no instance was a muscular coat discernible.
A distinct endothelial layer was in evidence with continuity into small capil-
laries that penetrated among the tumor cells. Only in one case was there
penetration of the walls of vessels by tumor cells (Figs. 8 & 9).
Hyaline changes in the walls of what are essentially sinusoidal vessels,
usually with some extension about capillaries (Fig. 10), was evident in all
but two of the tumors, and was extensive in three (Cases 2, 5, and 7). In
one case large quantities of extracellular amorphous acidophilic proteinace-
ous material (Fig. 11) staining faintly with the PAS stain was found (Case
9), and smaller quantities were observed in tissue from Cases 1, 2, 5, and 6.
This material was partially calcified (Fig. 12) in Cases 1, 5, and 9. In the
last mentioned, there were distinct psammoma bodies (Fig. 13).
For the most part the cells were plump and rounded or polygonal and had
distinct cell boundaries (Fig. 7). In many fields, however, they were rather
216

elongated and even spindle-shaped, especially in the near vicinity of the
large sinusoidal vessels (Fig. 14). In fact, in four of the tumors the spindle-
shaped elements predominated. The cytoplasm of the cells on closer view
was not quite ""clear,"" but contained scattered acidophilic granules, the latter
being quite prominent and closely placed in certain fields. The impression in
general was not that of vacuolization. Some cells were much larger than
others and granules in linear arrangement appeared to radiate from the
nucleus (""spider cells"") (Fig. 15). Other cells were rounded or polygonal
withi rather homogeneous acidophilic cytoplasm, and resembled neurons
(""neuroid cells"")
(Fig.
16). In certain of these the resemblance was
heightened by the presence of finely granular brown pigment that did not
stain for iron and that had the characteristics of ""lipochrome."" This ma-
terial was found, however, in occasional cells of all types (Fig. 17), but only
in Cases 1, 2, and 11. Multinucleated cells occurred in all of the tumors and
in two cases were frequent and prominent in some fields. Such cells also
were sometimes of large size (Fig. 18) and resembled Touton giant cells.
In these cells the nuclei were usually smaller than in others and often also
hyperchromatic.
In general the nuclei were quite variable in size, but with prominent
nuclear membranes. Only one mitosis was found (Case 8) out of many
hundreds of fields examined in all of the tumors (Fig. 19). A feature of
some nuclei was the presence of one, or sometimes
several clustered,
rounded, granular, acidophilic ""inclusions."" Some of these appeared to be
limited by membranes but without peripheral condensation of chromatin or
the presence of an intervening clear zone as in viral inclusions (Fig. 20).
Many of these ""inclusions,"" therefore, probably represented interdigitation
of cytoplasm with complexly contoured nuclei. However, others represented
intranuclear glycogen masses similar to those found in hepatic cell nuclei in
diabetes, as demonstrated by an even more intense staining by the PAS
method than the cytoplasm.
An astonishing feature in tissue rapidly fixed and dehydrated for embed-
ding in paraffin was the enormous quantity of PAS-positive material (Figs.
7 & 21). This material also stained intensely with Best's carmine. The
glycogen was easily leached out in aqueous solutions including 10%o formol.
There was considerable loss of staining after exposing the sections to
diastase. The composition of the material was established by chemical
analysis in one case (Case 4), made in the course of a study of the chemical
composition of lung tumors by Dr. Bruno Gerstl,' then at the Oakland VA
Hospital. The analysis revealed 10,657 p,-moles of glycogen-derived hexose/
100 grams of wet tissue. It is for this reason that the term ""sugar tumor""
was colloquially applied. Glycolipids were absent and other carbohydrates

were present in lesser concentration than in other lung tumors or in normal
control lung tissue (Table 2).
The Alcian technique revealed small quantities of stainable material, and
many cells were shown to contain considerable quantities of materials stain-
ing by the colloidal iron technique. In Wilder and Laidlaw reticulum stains
the fibers were shown to embrace individual cells for the most part (Figs.
9&22).
Even microscopically there was no evidence of a defined capsule, yet the
tumor cells were delimited from the parenchyma along a sharp, continuous
line (Fig. 23) without extensive intrusion into interalveolar or interlobular
septa, nor into lymphatics. Certain alveoli or larger air spaces were seen at
the boundary, and the lining cells of these structures were often cuboidal, as
is frequently the case when alveoli are immobilized.
Small acinar structures lined by cuboidal or low columnar cells (Fig. 24),
sometimes mucin producing, were found, especially near the periphery, of
seven of the twelve tumors. Such structures are common in some slides of
many slowly growing tumors within the lung, such as sclerosing hemangio-
mas and fibromas, and they occur even in nodules of ""metastasizing leio-
myoma."" The process is one of entrapment by non-destructive extension into
septa among the distal air spaces, and occasionally it can be glimpsed in
progress at the periphery of such lesions.
DISCUSSION
It would be of interest to discover a cell in normal tissue that would cor-
respond to the component elements of the tumor. As a first step an attempt
was made to find cells replete with glycogen in the periphery of the lung.
Normal lungs were therefore fixed- by introducing absolute alcohol into a
main bronchus and immersing them in the same fluid. Tissue blocks were
then cut and put through additional dehydration directly into xylol and

paraffin. They were then cut and stained by the periodic acid-Schiff method
and with Best's carmine. Some of the large free cells in the alveoli, prob-
ably representing both granular pneumocytes and phagocytic pneumocytes,
contained closely crowded uniform PAS positive granules that were in-
terpreted as cytosomes or residual bodies. No cells resembling those of the
clear cell tumor were discovered. The ""alveolar brush cells"" identified in
electron micrographs by Meyrick and Reid' have been shown to contain
glycogen but, as judged from the published micrographs, the amount is not
large. Tumors derived from cells lining alveoli or bronchioles might be ex-
pected to have, in part at least, an acinar structure, but this was not the
case in any of the neoplasms of the present series. None of these has as yet
been examined with the electron microscope, a procedure that would indeed
be of interest.
A myoid origin for the benign clear cell tumor was considered, especially
because of the existence of descriptions of clear cell leiomyomas of the
uterus' and of the stomach.' In these leiomyomas the cells are rounded or
spindle-shaped, with strikingly clear cytoplasm and sharply defined cell
boundaries. These resemblances, however, are superficial, since Rywlin and
coworkers' have reported that stains for glycogen, as well as for mucopoly-
saccharides, were negative in the clear cell tumors of the uterus. Moreover,
it may be expected that smooth muscle tumors would arise in relation to
bronchioles or the large pulmonary vessels, rather than in the very periphery
of the lung, as appears to be the case with the benign clear cell tumors.
There has been considerable confusion between the diagnosis of benign
clear cell tumor and the ""Grawitz,"" hypernephroid -or clear cell tumor of
the kidney metastatic in the lung. One would expect that such metastatic
tumors would be multiple, and it is also well known that many involve
bronchi. While such tumors stain with PAS, they do not contain the im-
mense quantities of glycogen typical of these benign primary tumors of the
lung, and they are further distinguished by their content of lipid and some-
times of iron. Necrosis occurs often in renal carcinomas, and the process
may be accompanied by hemorrhage. Mitoses also are commonly present,
while these are exceedingly rare in the benign clear cell tumors. Of im-
portance in differential diagnosis is that the blood supply is at least in part
by means of thick walled arterioles, although sinusoidal vessels may also be
present.
Reports of ""clear cell carcinomas"" of the lung have appeared.`' These are
bronchogenic tumors that have histological and biological characteristics of
malignancy. They contain only small droplets of PAS-positive material.
Characteristically large masses of cells are isolated or bundled by the con-
nective tissue stroma and reticulum fibers do not extend among the indi-

of sinusoidal blood supply, clearly distinguish these neoplasms from the be-

Features that are helpful in distinguishing the benign clear cell tumors
from other pulmonary lesions are recorded in Table 3. Chemodectomas' in
the lung are usually quite minute, although some quite large peripheral
tumors have been described. In their peripheral position and sinusoidal and
capillary type of blood supply they are quite reminiscent of the clear cell
tumor, but they lack glycogen. The same is true of bronchial carcinoid
tumors, which additionally are related to bronchi or bronchioles, to the
lumina of which the tumor cells usually present without intervention of a
connective tissue barrier at some point. In both instances reticulum sur-
rounds groups of cells. This relationship also exists in the ""alveolar soft
parts sarcoma."" This tumor is of controversial histogenesis, since some con-
sider it to represent chemodectoma, whereas others interpret it as malignant
granular cell myoblastoma. In several such tumors Ross and coworkers
reported occasional fine carminophilic granules after staining by the Best
carmine method-but not a massive content of glycogen. Likewise, in benign
granular cell myoblastoma Pearse""2 demonstrated both PAS-positive gran-
ules and, contrary to the findings of others, lipid as well. Granular cell myo-
blastomas do occur in the lung but in bronchi7 rather than in the periphery,
and their blood supply also bears no resemblance to that of the benign clear
cell tumor. Hemangiopericytomas""""' also do not contain significant quanti-
ties of glycogen.

In sclerosing lhmangioma large vacuolated or clear cells can be related
in part to sinusoidal channels. This is exemplified both in lunge and in the
central nervous system, especially the cerebellum.1 The cells in sclerosing
hemangioma, however, include large numbers of histiocytes laden with fat
and usually replete with hemosiderin. Thus, the differential diagnosis is not
difficult, especially since the hemangiomatous characteristics of the lesion
are usually quite evident in the less cellular parts.
Thus the clear cell tumor of the lung appears to be distinctive and pos-
sibly unique.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Benign peripheral tumors composed of ""clear cells"" present silently in the
lung, chiefly in middle-aged persons, as ""coin lesions."" The most distinctive
feature is their immense content of glycogen demonstrable after appropriate
histological preparation or by analysis. This feature, the absence of fat and
hemosiderin within tumor cells, the great scarcity of mitoses, the fact that
necrosis does not occur, and the sinusoidal rather than arteriolar blood sup-
ply, make possible an unequivocal differentiation from metastases in the
lung from renal tumors, with which these benign neoplasms have commonly
been confused. The cell of origin is as yet unknown.
There is evidence that the benign clear cell tumors of the lung are usually
slow growing and that they do not recur or metastasize even after simple
enucleation, which is facilitated by the absence of invasion or of a relation-
ship to larger vessels or bronchi.

5778789,"THE RENAL HANDLING OF HEMOGLOBIN 
I. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION*,~

Research Laboratory, Fort Knox, Kentucky 40121) 
(Received for publication 6 January 1969) 
During a severe hemolytic process, circulating free hemoglobin readily passes 
through the renal glomeruli. Filtered hemoglobin is extensively taken up by 
the cells of the proximal tubule (1, 2). When the absorbtive capacity of these 
cells is exceeded, hemoglobinuria ensues. 
The permeability of glomeruli, and presumably of other capillaries, for 
hemoglobin is considerably greater than for albumin, a protein of similar 
mol wt (3). Recent information concerning the structural and physical prop- 
erties of the hemoglobin molecule offers a possible explanation. Hemoglobin 
is a tetramer consisting of two pairs of unlike chains (a~3~). The molecule dis- 
sociates reversibly into two symmetrical dimers: a~2 ~ 2aft. Under physi- 
ologic conditions of pH and ionic strength, a 100 mg/100 ml solution of human 
oxyhemoglobin is about one-fourth in the form of dimers, as calculated from a 
recently derived equilibrium constant (4). The reversible dissociation of hemo- 
globin into dimers, each with a mol wt of about 32,000, suggests the possibility 
that it is this form that so readily penetrates glomeruli. 
The extent of dissociation is known to be affected by several conditions: 
(a) It is enhanced by dilution; (b) hemoglobins of various species differ widely 
in their tendency to form dimers (5, 6); (c) Simon and Konigsberg have recently 
studied the physical and chemical properties of hemoglobin that was reacted 
with the sulfhydryl reagent bis(N-maleimidomethyl) ether (BME) (7). One 
of BME's two imido groups binds covalently with each of hemoglobin's two 
reactive sulfhydryl groups, in a manner similar to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) 
(Fig. 1). The remainder of the BME molecule interacts noncovalently with

another part of the i$-chain in such a way that dissociation of the tetramer into 
half molecules is markedly reduced, although the tertiary configuration of 
the tetramer is undisturbed. 
The following experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that hemo- 
globin is filtered by the glomeruli primarily as the afl-dimer. In addition, in 
vitro studies on BME hemoglobin were done in order to evaluate its possible 
usefulness as a plasma expander.

Methods and Materials 
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-350 g, New Zealand white rabbits, and mongrel 
dogs were used in these studies. 
Preparation of ttemogiobin Solulions.--Rat, cat, and dog hemoglobins were labeled with 
StCr by adding NaalCrO41 to freshly collected heparinized blood (1 #c/ml RBC) followed by 
30 rain of gentle shaklng at room temperature. The labeled red cells were then washed 3 X 
with normal saline. Cells were lysed by adding two volumes of cold distilled water to packed 
red cells. Isotonicity was restored by the addition of one-fifth the water volume of 5.0% 
NaC1 to cat and dog hemolysates. 7.5% Nal:ICOa was added to the rat hemolysate, since

others have shown rat hemoglobin is more soluble in alkaline solution (8). Each hemolysate 
was then centrifuged at 4°C for 30 rain at 5000 g. The crystal dear supernatant was dialyzed 
overnight at 4°C against a mixture comprised of three parts normal saline and one part iso- 
tonic phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (buffered saline). Dialysis effectively removed all unbound 
5ZCr from the hemoglobin solution. This was demonstrated on several occasions by chromato- 
graphing an aliquot of the dialyzed 51Cr hemogiobin on Sephadex G-25, which effectively 
separates the protein-bound and unbound SlCr (8). The specific activities of the hemogiobin 
sohitions before and after chromatography were always identical. 
5OFe rabbit hemoglobin was prepared as follows. Reticniocytes were obtained by the 
removal of 30% of a rabbit's blood volume every 2nd day. 2 days after the third phlebotomy, 
the rabbit's blood contained 40-70% reticulocytes. The red cells were incubated with two 
volumes of heparinized plasma from an iron-deficient rabbit to which 59FeCla 2 and glucose 
(2.0 mg/ml) had been added. This mixture was incubated at 37°C with gentle shaking for 3 
hr. After the red cells were washed 5 X with isotonic saline, hemoglobin was prepared as 
outlined above. 59Fe rat hemogiobin was prepared as outlined by Keene and Jandl (9). BME 
hemoglobin was prepared by the addition of a 4 ~ excess of an aqueous solution of bis (N- 
maleimidomethyl) ether a to an aliquot of the labeled oxyhemogiobin (i.e., 1 mole BME/mole 
of hemoglobin heine). After the mixture stood for 4 hr at 4°C it was dialyzed against buffered 
saline to remove excess reagent. Titration of reactive sulfhydryl groups of hemoglobin solu- 
tions treated with BME, done by the method of Boyer (10), showed that the reaction had 
gone to completion. BME human hemoglobin was prepared as previously described (11). 
Rat Expeeiments.--Intravenous injections were made into taft veins of rats lightly anes- 
thetized with ether. Rats received 2.0 ml injections containing 65 nag of SgFe or 51Cr rat oxy- 
hemogiobin, either untreated or reacted with BME. This large dose of hemoglobin was greatly 
in excess of the 5-8 mg binding capacity of plasma haptoglobin. Periodic blood samples were 
coliected with a 0.1 ml pipette after nicking the tip of the tail with a scalpel blade at a point 
several cm distal to the site of injection. In some experiments, animals were placed in sepa- 
rate metabolic cages permitting continons urine coliection. 3-5 hr after injection, the animals 
were sacrificed. In some instances, organs were removed and radioactivity was measured, as 
described in detail elsewhere (9, 12). Liver and spleen radioactivity was corrected for the 
contribution from the activity of the plasma trapped in the organ at the time of sacrifice. 
Total urine activity was calculated from the cpm/ml and the measured urine volume. In one 
experiment, the hemoglobin concentration of rat urine was also measured by the benzidine 
method of Crosby and Furth (14). In another experiment, rats were nephrectomized under 
light ether anesthesia 18 hr before they were given hemoglobin injections. 
Rabbit Experimen~s.--Rabbits were depleted of haptoglobin by two intravenous injections 
of unlabded rabbit hemoglobin (50 mg/kg) 1 hr apart. 1 hr after the second dose, the animals 
were lightly anesthetized with sodium pentothal. A No. 22 polyethylene catheter was passed 
up from the lower abdominal aorta to the level of the renal arteries. The aorta was then ligated 
just distal to these vessels. The anterior mesenteric artery was also ligated. Rabbits so can- 
nulated were injected rapidly with a I ml bolus of ~gFe oxyhemoglobin of varying concentra- 
tions. 30 sec after the injection, the renal arteries were clamped and the aorta ligated proxi- 
mal to the renal arteries. The kidneys were then perfused with 20 ml of isotonic saline and 
removed for counting. Following perfusion, renal vein blood generally had a packed cell vol- 
ume of less than 2%. Urine flow persisted through the operative procedure, but no bladder 
urine activity could be detected. Both kidneys were sliced into four equal parts of approxi-

mately 2 ml, each of which was counted separately in a well scintillation counter. One experi- 
ment employed haptoglobin-rich rabbit serum obtained from a rabbit 4 days after induction 
of a turpentine abscess (13). 1.0 mg of labeled hemoglobin was added per ml of serum, an 
amount insufficient to exceed the binding capacity of the serum. 
Dog Experiment.--Two dogs were given an intravenous injection of 200 mg/kg of 51Cr 
BME hemoglobin, while two others received untreated 51Cr hemoglobin. Six blood samples 
were taken over an 8 hr period. No urine collection was made. 
Miscellaneous Procedures.--Mter the addition of a known amount of unlabeled hemoglobin 
as carrier, SgFe hemin was crystallized from samples of plasma by the method of Labbe and 
Nishida (15). The purified hemin solution was then recounted. Mter correcting for incom- 
plete recovery, the per cent of plasma activity present as 59Fe heme could be calculated. 
In order to test the extent of subunit dissociation of BME hemoglobin, a mixture contain- 
ing 10 mg each of unlabeled rat carboxyhemoglobin and 59Fe BME carboxyhemoglobin was 
chromatographed on a 50 X 2 cm column of Sephadex G-1004 in 0.1 ~r phosphate buffer, 
pH 7.4. The total hemoglobin concentration of successive fractions was obtained from the 
absorbance of an appropriate dilution in Drabkin's solution measured at 540 m/z. The radio- 
activity of an aliquot of each fraction was also measured. From these data, the relative amounts 
of normal and BME hemoglobin in each fraction could be calculated as described in detail 
elsewhere (6). 
Oxygen dissociation curves were done gasometrically on heparinized human whole blood 
and hemoglobin solutions in plasma by a modification of the method of Peters and Van Slyke 
(16), which is described in detail elsewhere (17). 
The rate of auto-oxidation of solutions of untreated and BME hemoglobin in buffered 
saline was measured at 37°C. Except for the initial reaction with BME, both solutions were 
treated alike throughout their preparation. Ferrihemoglobin concentration was estimated by 
the procedure of Evelyn and Malloy (18). 
Alkali denaturation of hemoglobins was tested by the method of Huisman and Meyering 
(19). 
RESULTS 
In Vivo Studies.--Following intravenous injection into rats, BME hemo- 
globin disappeared from the circulation much more slowly than untreated 
hemoglobin (Fig. 2). This was true whether hemoglobin was labeled with 
59Fe or 51Cr. The plasma 59Fe activity several hr after injection did not neces- 
sarily represent hemoglobin iron. However, crystallization of heroin in plasma 
withdrawn 5 hr after injection indicated that 88 % of the plasma 59Fe activity 
was heine iron. Thus there was little 59Fe-transferrin activity in the plasma. 
In one experiment, animals were sacrificed 3 hr after injection with 59Fe- 
labeled BME and untreated hemoglobin, and the distribution of activity in 
various organs was measured (Table I). As expected, the plasma 59Fe activity 
was considerably higher in the rats receiving BME hemoglobin. This difference 
was accounted for primarily in the lesser accumulation of ~gFe in the kidneys 
and urine in the animals receiving BME hemoglobin. The total activity repre- 
sented by the plasma, reficuloendothelial system, and urinary system in the 
group receiving BME hemoglobin averaged 54% of the injected dose, con-

siderably less than the 79 % found in the group which received untreated hemo- 
globin. The activity not accounted for by these organs presumably represented 
hemoglobin which permeated the general capillary bed. Because untreated 
hemoglobin was so rapidly trapped by the kidneys, after injection there was 
less circulating hemoglobin available for transendothelial escape. 
The plasma disappearance of 59Fe-labeled BME and untreated hemoglobin

was measured in nephrectomized rats (Fig. 3). The rates of decline in radio- 
activity in both groups were similar to the plasma disappearance of BME 
hemoglobin in intact rats (Fig. 2), confirming that the prolonged plasma sur- 
vival of BME hemoglobin was due primarily to its minimal renal excretion. 
In a parallel experiment, rats were injected with 65 mg of either SlCr dog 
hemoglobin or 51Cr cat hemoglobin, and then sacrificed 3 hr later. (It was not 
practical to prepare 59Fe-labeled cat and dog hemoglobins). The rationale of 
this experiment lies in the fact that cat and dog hemoglobins differ greatly in 
their degree of subunit dissociation. Under similar conditions cat hemoglobin 
splits into dimers much more readily than hemoglobin of the dog or other 
animals tested (6). The urinary excretion of cat hemoglobin greatly exceeded

that of dog hemoglobin (Table II). The data shown in the right-hand column 
represent hemoglobin concentrations determined by a benzidine method (13), 
which is preferable to a direct spectrophotometric method since urinary 
hemoglobin is a mixture of various forms (oxyhemoglobin, ferrihemoglobin, 
parahematins) which have approximately equal peroxidase activities. Urine 
51Cr activities paralleled these measurements but were somewhat higher, 
especially with dog hemoglobin. Perhaps during the 3 hr collection period, 
some 5zCr was eluted from the injected hemoglobin and excreted. Kidney ac- 
tivity was similar in the two groups, averaging 9 %, but again, how much of this 
activity represents unbound ~lCr, and how much was eluted from absorbed 
labeled hemoglobin are open to question. 
In order to study the effect of varying hemoglobin concentration on glo- 
merular filtration, the renal uptake of SgFe rabbit hemoglobin was measured 30 
sec after rapid injection at the level of the renal arteries. This approach al-

lowed a rough approximation of the hemoglobin clearance during one circula- 
tion through the kidneys. The uptake by other organs (such as the reticulo- 
endothelial system) was minimized. Since perfusion of the kidneys presumably 
removed most of the intravascular hemoglobin, and since no activity ever ap- 
peared in the urine, the renal activity represented primarily hemoglobin that 
was filtered and absorbed. As shown in Fig. 4, the per cent of the hemoglobin

hemoglobin. When glomerular filtration was prevented by binding 59Fe rabbit 
hemoglobin to rabbit haptoglobin (100 rag/100 ml), only 1.3 % of the injected 
activity was detected in the kidneys (average of three experiments). 
Dogs were given 200 mg/kg of either 51Cr-labeled BME hemoglobin or un- 
treated hemoglobin (Fig. 5). As in the rat, BME hemoglobin had a much more 
prolonged plasma survival than untreated hemoglobin. The two dogs appeared 
to tolerate BME hemoglobin well. Complete blood counts and blood urea nitro-

due to a reduced degree of dissociation into afl-dimers (6). Earlier sedimenta-

A gasometric method was used to measure oxygen dissociation curves in order

blood. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 7. Under physiologic con-

specimen had an oxygen dissociation curve considerably to the left, showing 
increased oxygen affinity as indicated by the lower Ps0 value of 17.5 nun Hg.

P60 of 17.0 mm Hg. Mixtures of hemoglobin and plasma from five other donors 
also had considerably lower Ps0 values than the corresponding whole blood 
specimens. These data have been presented in more detail in another report 
(20). Others have also observed a higher oxygen a~inity of saponin and freeze- 
thaw hemolysates compared to whole blood (21, 22). The oxygen dissociation 
curve of BME hemoglobin in plasma was hyperbolic with a very high oxygen

affinity: P60, 3 mm Hg; n, 6 0.9. Since the very low oxygen pressures required 
for this curve were difficult to measure accurately, there was necessarily more 
scatter than in the other two curves represented in Fig. 7. Using a spectro- 
photometric method which is better suited to measuring oxygen equilibria on 
hemoglobins of such high affinity, Simon and Konigsberg obtained a P60 of 
about 2.2 mm Hg (corrected to pH 7.40, 37°C) and an n of 1.00 (7).

conditions was compared with that of untreated hemoglobin. In each of three 
experiments, one of which is shown in Fig. 8, ferrihemoglobin accumulated less 
rapidly when hemoglobin was reacted with BME. BME hemoglobin and 
untreated hemoglobin had equal rates of alkali denaturation. 
DISCUSSION 
These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that hemoglobin (a~fl2) 
is filtered by the glomerulus primarily as a half molecule (a~). The equilibrium

between the tetramer and the dimer is reached so rapidly that physical separa- 
tion of the two forms is not possible. Thus it was necessary to study the glo- 
merular filtration of hemoglobin under conditions in which the dissociation 
equilibrium was shifted in one direction or the other. 
As in any sell-associating system, the relative formation of hemoglobin 
subunits is enhanced by decreasing concentration. One could predict that, if 
the above hypothesis were correct, the renal clearance of low plasma con- 
centrations of hemoglobin would be greater than that of high concentrations. 
However, it would be difficult if not impossible to show these clearance differ- 
ences in the intact animal, since at low levels of plasma hemoglobin the mole- 
cule is largely absorbed in the proximal tubule of the nephron. Monke and 
Yuile found that renal hemoglobin clearance in dogs was extremely variable 
below a plasma level of 400 rag/100 ml (23). To circumvent this, we injected a 
small (1 ml) volume of varying concentrations of 5~Fe hemoglobin directly 
into the renal arteries of rabbits. Since no activity was detected in the urine, 
even after the injection of high concentration (60 mg/ml), it is assumed that 
the filtered hemoglobin remained trapped in the kidneys. Since this is a highly 
indirect way of estimating glomerular filtration, the results cannot be considered 
conclusive. Nevertheless, the observed inverse relationship between renal 
uptake and concentration of the injected hemoglobin suggests that dilute 
hemoglobin was more readily filtered. 
There is some variability in the extent to which various animal hemoglobins 
dissociate into subunits (5, 6). Cat and dog hemoglobins were selected because 
they differ widely in this respect, cat hemoglobin forming dimers much more 
readily than dog hemoglobin. (6). The greater excretion of cat hemoglobin by 
the rat kidney can be attributed to increased glomerular filtration. Any differ- 
ence in the tubular absorption of cat and dog hemoglobins seems unlikely since 
the ~lCr kidney activity was the same in the two groups. Hemoglobin which 
was reacted with the sulfhydryl reagent BME showed both a decreased tend- 
ency to dissociate into dimers and a reduced renal clearance in the rat. The 
rapid plasma disappearance of untreated rat hemoglobin was due primarily to 
its extensive renal excretion. The disappearance of plasma hemoglobin was 
prolonged in nephrectomized rats or intact rats (and dogs) receiving BME 
hemoglobin. 
Although hemoglobin has several properties which would make it a suitable 
plasma expander (24, 25, 26), it disappears from the plasma much more rapidly 
than other plasma substitutes such as albumin or clinical dextran. Whether 
or not hemoglobin per se is nephrotoxic, it would be advantageous if its renal 
excretion could be curtailed. The experiments cited above suggest that this 
can be accomplished by reacting hemoglobin with BME. 
One unique advantage offered by hemoglobin as a plasma expander would 
be its ability to bind and unload oxygen reversibly. The reaction of hemoglobin

921 
with ligands such as oxygen appears to be dependent upon subunit dissociation. 
Models recently proposed by Benesch and associates (27) and Guidotti (28) 
predict that if liganded hemoglobin has an increased extent of dissociation into 
dimers it will have a reduced oxygen afl~n{ty and vice versa. Cat hemoglobin, 
and the human variant, hemoglobin Kansas (29, 6), both of which have an 
increased degree of dimer formation, have unusually low oxygen affinities. 
Conversely, as predicted from the above models, BME hemoglobin has a very 
high affinity. The oxygen dissociation data shown in Fig. 1 were obtained from 
hemoglobin solutions in plasma, thus simulating conditions of hemoglobin serv- 
ing as a plasma expander. The oxygen affinity of BME hemoglobin is so high 
that in the physiologic range of PO2, virtually no oxygen would be unloaded to 
tissues. However, solutions of untreated hemoglobin in plasma also had a 
relatively high oxygen affinity, compared to whole blood, as shown by a shift 
to the left of the oxygen dissociation curve. Because of the difference in oxygen 
amnity between hemoglobin circulating in plasma and that in red cells, most of 
the oxygen transport would be carried on by the red cells, even under condi- 
tions where a large proportion of the blood volume were replaced by the hemo- 
globin solution. After dogs were infused with large amounts of hemoglobin 
solution, Rabiner and his associates found that the mean oxygen content of 
arterial plasma samples was 3.60 vol/100 ml, representing 97% saturation 
(25). However, the mean oxygen content of mixed venous plasma was only 13 % 
less. Since the red cell hemoglobin was presumably in excess of the plasma hemo- 
globin, the total contribution of the plasma to oxygen exchange would be cor- 
respondingly less. 
If a hemoglobin solution is to serve as a plasma expander, it is critical that 
the formation of ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin) be minimized, whether 
during preparation, storage, or after infusion. Ferrihemoglobin increases the 
oxygen ~nity of the remaining active hemoglobin. Furthermore, upon oxida- 
tion of hemoglobin, its heine groups become less firmly bound to globin. When 
mixtures of ferrihemoglobin and plasma are incubated at 37°C, heroes readily 
transfer to albumin and hemopexin, leaving a denuded unstable globin (30). 
Finally, some reports from the earlier literature have indicated that ferri- 
hemoglobin had greater renal toxicity than oxyhemoglobin (31, 32). As shown 
in Fig. 8, BME hemoglobin had a reduced rate of auto-oxidation, under physi- 
ologic conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. For this reason, 
BME hemoglobin would probably have greater stability in plasma than un- 
treated hemoglobin. 
SUMMARY 
The glomerular filtration of hemoglobin (a~2) was studied under conditions 
in which its dissociation into a~ dimers was experimentally altered. Rats re- 
ceiving hemoglobin treated with the sulfhydryl reagent bis(N-maleimido-

methyl) ether (BME) showed a much lower renal excretion and prolonged 
plasma survival as compared with animals injected with untreated hemoglobin. 
Plasma disappearance was also prolonged in dogs receiving BME hemoglobin. 
Gel filtration data indicated that under physiological conditions, BME hemo- 
globin had impaired subunit dissociation. In addition, BME hemoglobin showed 
a very high oxygen affinity and a decreased rate of auto-oxldation. 
Glomerular filtration was enhanced under conditions which favor the dis- 
sociation of hemoglobin into dimers. Cat hemoglobin, which forms subunits 
much more extensively than canine hemoglobin, was excreted more readily 
by the rat kidney. The renal uptake of 5gFe hemoglobin injected intra-arterially 
into rabbits varied inversely with the concentration of the injected dose. 
We are indebted to Dr. James H. Jandl for his helpful advice.

Summary
The metastatic sites of infiltrating duct (IDC) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) have been
compared using both clinical and autopsy data. The following statistically significant differences were found:
1. Lung parenchymal metastases were more common in IDC.
2. Bone trephine biopsies were more likely to be positive in ILC.
3. Carcinomatous meningitis was associated almost exclusively with ILC.
4. Peritoneal/retroperitoneal metastases of distinctive pattern occurred in ILC. There was often associated
linitis plastica-like involvement of the stomach wall and diffuse infiltration of the uterus. Hydronephrosis
was a common secondary phenomenon.
Carcinoma
of the
breast
includes
a number
of
histological
subtypes
of
which
the
two
most
common are infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) and
infiltrating
lobular
carcinoma
(ILC).
Seventy
to
eighty percent of all breast carcinomas are IDCs
and
ILC
is
the
second
most
frequent
type,
accounting for at least 8% (Martinez & Azzopardi,
1979). Despite considerable recent interest in the
clinical,
histopathological
and hormone
receptor
aspects of ILC and despite the fact that there have
been many
studies
of the pattern
of metastases
produced by carcinoma of the breast (Willis, 1967;
Viadana et al., 1973a, b; Cifuentes & Pickren, 1979;
Amer,
1982),
there
is
very
little
published
information
about
the
comparative
metastatic
patterns of ILC and IDC. Clinical experiences with
a number of patients suggested to us that ILC
might have a distinctive metastatic pattern and we
therefore
set
out
to examine
this
possibility by
comparing the sites of metastases in cases of IDC
and ILC, using both clinical and autopsy data.
Materials and methods
Clinical material
Eight hundred and thirty one patients with IDC
and 135 with ILC presenting to Withington and
Christie Hospitals, Manchester between 1976 and
1982 were compared.
Their
clinical,
pathological
and
radiological
records were examined
to
find
evidence of metastases. Cases with a mixed pattern
of IDC and ILC were excluded from the analysis.

Autopsy series
The autopsy records of Withington and Christie
Hospitals for the period January 1972-April 1983
were searched for cases of carcinoma of the breast.
One hundred and nine cases were found and of
these
92
had
distant
metastases.
The
autopsy
reports were abstracted to determine the sites of
metastatic disease and the histological sections were
reviewed to determine the histological classification
of the tumours. In this way 76 cases of metastatic
IDC were compared with 14 of metastatic ILC. The
other
two
metastasising
tumours
were
mucoid
carcinomas and will not be considered further. Of
the
17
non-metastasising
carcinomas
11
were
ductal, two were lobular, three were mucoid and
one was of unknown type.
Statistical method
The
chi-square
test

with
Yates' correction or Fisher's exact test was used. A
result was taken
to be
statistically significant
if
P <0.05
when

test
was
applied.

reflects detection by a particular investigation the
denominator
indicates
the number
of metastatic
cases where the investigation was performed;
in
some cases the data were not available, hence the
denominator is variable. The following statistically
significant differences between IDC and ILC were
found:
1. Metastases
in lung parenchyma were detected
during life significantly more often in IDC than
ILC; this is also true in the autopsy series (Table
III).
2. Bone
trephine
biopsis
of
iliac

were
significantly more likely to be positive in ILC
than IDC.
3. The final and most striking difference provided
by the clinical evidence is the propensity for ILC
to produce carcinomatous meningitis. Only 1/16
patients with IDC and central nervous system
disease had carcinomatous meningitis compared
with 9/10 such ILC patients. In 3/9 ILC patients
with carcinomatous meningitis
it was the first
clinical feature of relapse. The clinical features of
these 9 cases are summarized in Table IV; all
were proven by cytological examination of the
cerebro-spinal fluid or at autopsy (Figs. la and
lb).

the retroperitoneum there was a similar pattern; in
severe cases this imparted a rigidity to the tissue
and in one case the retroperitoneum was described
as
thickened
and
woody-hard. A much
smaller
percentage of IDC cases had peritoneal metastases
and
these were
usually
in
the form
of nodular
masses rather than the diffuse pattern seen in ILC.
In 8/13 cases of ILC with diffuse retroperitoneal
spread there was some degree of hydronephrosis,
either bilateral (4 cases) or unilateral (4 cases). In
seven of the cases dilatation was confined to the
renal
pelvis
and
only
one
had
any
ureteric
dilatation. In three cases where the ureters were
examined histologically there was a sparse infiltrate
of carcinoma
cells in the muscle coats with the
lumen apparently remaining patent (Figure 3). Only
one
case
of
IDC
was
associated
with
hydronephrosis and this was due to a large pelvic
mass of metastatic tumour. Further manifestations
of this diffuse intra-abdominal metastatic process
were
infiltration
of
myometrium,
endometrium,
uterine cervix and ovaries and also of the stomach.
In the stomach the extent of involvement varied
from localised
to extensive but
it was always a
diffuse spreading process with carcinoma cells in
serosa, muscularis propria, submucosa and

plastica-like appearance in the most severe cases. In
the two cases of IDC with gastric metastases the

adopted
a

configuration,
quite
different to that seen in ILC.
Discussion
There have been many published series reporting the
metastic pattern resulting from carcinoma of the
breast (Willis, 1967; Viadana et al., 1973a, b; Cifuentes
& Pickren, 1979; Amer, 1982) but even the more
recent of them give
little
or no consideration
to
possible differences in the metastatic behaviour of
the
different
histological
sub-types
of
breast
carcinoma.
Our
results
indicate
that
there
are
statistically significant differences between IDC and
ILC with regard to some metastatic sites and these
findings require some amplification.
Central nervous system metastasis
ILC demonstrated a striking tendency to produce
diffuse meningeal involvement, compared with IDC.
The evidence was obtained mainly from the clinical
series where 9/10 ILC patients with CNS disease
had carcinomatous meningitis compared with only
1/16 IDC cases. In the four autopsied cases of ILC
with carcinomatous meningitis only one also had
intra-cerebral metastases.
There have been several studies of carcinomatous
meningitis due to breast carcinoma and Olsen et al.
(1974)
reported
on
50
cases
of
carcinomatous
meningitis, including 18 with breast cancer. Hwee-
Yong et al. (1978) reported a series of 25 cases of

meningeal carcinomatosis due to breast carcinoma.
However, these studies gave no consideration to the
pathological
type
of the
breast
cancer
and
we
believe
our
data
are
the
first
indication
of an
important
difference
in
the
pattern
of
CNS
involvement
by
these
two
forms
of
breast
carcinoma.
Peritoneal/retroperitoneal spread
Our autopsy findings indicate a very high risk of
peritoneal
and
retroperitoneal
spread
from ILC
compared with IDC and that the pattern of the
metastases is distinctive with tiny nodules, tending
to become confluent, in ILC compared with larger
masses or nodules in IDC.
This
pattern
of involvement
with ILC
rarely
produced clinical manifestations but in 8/13 cases
there was
some
degree
of hydronephrosis.
This
was
apparently due
to
diffuse
extension
of the
retroperitoneal
tumour
into
the
ureteric
walls
without
damage
to
the
epithelium
or
actual
extension
into
the lumina.
Alternatively,
it may
have
been
due
to
rigidity
of
the
surrounding
infiltrated
retroperitoneal
tissues.
In
3
of these
patients
there was radiological evidence of renal
pelvic dilatation, usually seen as accumulation of

isotope in the renal pelvis noted incidentally
on
routine bone scanning.
There is little recorded information about ureteric
obstruction due
to carcinoma of the breast but
three reports are of interest.
Geller & Lin (1975) described two such
cases.
Case
1 was recorded as being due to IDC but the
photomicrograph (their Figure 2) is suggestive of an
infiltrating lobular carcinoma; in their Case 2 the
histology
is
not
specified
but
the
relevant
photomicrograph (their Figure 4) suggests a ductal
pattern. The same authors also found, from autopsy
records, that 8.3% of 181 cases of breast cancer had
ureteric metastases but further details are not given.
Feun
et
al.
(1979)
reported
on
5
cases
of
metastatic breast cancer in which there was ureteric
obstruction: their Cases 3 and 5 were reported to
have ureters encased in a 'fibrous sheath' and in
'tumour' respectively; these findings are reminiscent
of
some
of
our
ILC
cases,
and
the
photomicrographs
illustrating
these
2
cases
are
suggestive of ILC although they are not identified
as such in the text. The illustration accompanying
their Case 1 suggests IDC and the histology of the
other two cases
is not illustrated, although
it
is
stated to be 'scirrhous infiltrating adenocarcinoma'
(Case 2) and 'infiltrating duct carcinoma' (Case 4) in
the text.
Most interesting is the study of Merino & Livolsi
(1981) who reported on 24 cases of the signet ring
cell variant of ILC. They noted a propensity for
involvement of serous surfaces mimicking gastro-
intestinal disease or retroperitoneal fibrosis and 5 of
the
patients had
hydronephrosis
due
to
diffuse
tumour cell infiltration of the ureteric walls. Our
findings support their observations but indicate that
these phenomena are related to lobular carcinoma
in general, not just to its signet ring cell variant.
Stomach and intestine
Six of our 14 autopsied cases of metastatic ILC had
involvement of the stomach and an additional 4
involved the intestinal wall. Only 5/75 metastatic
IDCs had spread to the stomach or intestine. In the
case
of the
lobular
carcinomas
the
pattern
of
infiltration was distinctive with diffuse infiltration of
serosa, muscularis propria, submucosa and mucosa
by carcinoma cells. In the stomach this produced a
linitis plastica-like thickening of the wall and in one
case there were associated deep ulcers. In contrast,
the ductal metastases produced nodular masses.
The phenomenon of gastro-intestinal metastases
from breast carcinoma is recorded by Sung et al.
(1964), Graham & Goldman (1964) and Klein &
Sherlock
(1972) amongst
others.
However, most
interesting in the present context is the report by
Cormier
et
al. (1980) of 33 patients with
linitis
plastica due to metastases from lobular carcinoma
of the breast; they did not see any cases with a
linitis
plastica
pattern
resulting
from
ductal
carcinoma
which,
they
noted, produced
discrete
nodules.
Our
findings
confirm
these
observations
and
there seems little doubt that this form of gastric
metastasis is mainly, if not exclusively, associated
with
ILC.
Its
occurrence
may
be
of
clinical
importance
since
the
gastro-intestinal
symptoms
which can occur as a result may lead to radiological
and biopsy evidence suggestive of a primary gastric
carcinoma and thus to inappropriate management.
Uterus
Six of our 14 cases of lobular carcinoma showed
diffuse
infiltration
involving
myometrium,
endometrium and, in one case, cervix.

The uterus is an unusual site for metastasis but a
recent paper by Kumar & Hart (1982) reports on
63
extragenital
neoplasms
metastasising
to
the
uterine corpus;
of these 29 (42.9%)
were
breast
carcinomas and, whilst they are not fully analysed
with regard to histological type, two cases cited in
some
detail
were
respectively
infiltrating
lobular
and signet ring carcinomas (which is often a variant
of lobular carcinoma).
In
the
first
of these
the
pattern of infiltration of the endometrial stroma had
suggested to the referring pathologist the possibility
of endometrial stromal sarcoma or adenosarcoma.
In one
of our own
cases
cervical and bladder
biopsies showed signet ring carcinoma which was
regarded as being possibly primary in the bladder
until
it was
discovered
that
there had
been
a
previous
mastectomy
for
infiltrating
lobular
carcinoma. Clearly there are important implications
for the interpretation of uro-genital tract biopsies
from
patients
having
lobular carcinoma
of the
breast. The histological recognition
of metastatic
ILC in these and other situations may be difficult.
However,
metastatic
ILC
maintains
its
characteristic
small
cell
pattern
often
with
dissociated cells and cells arranged in single files.
This
coupled
with
the
use
of PAS/Alcian
blue
staining to demonstrate the typical morphology of
the
intra-cytoplasmic
lumina
which
are
a
characteristic feature of ILC (Gad & Azzopardi,
1975)
should
raise
the
suspicions
of
the
histopathologist and lead him to seek any relevant
history
of
an
antecedent
or
co-existent
breast
tumour.
In summary, our data suggest that ILC behaves
differently
from IDC
with
regard
to
metastatic
pattern and there is some support for our views in
Figure 5

the
rather
fragmentary
literature.
Knowledge
of
these differences may prove important in assessing
clinical symptoms and signs in patients known to
have breast cancer and in interpreting biopsies and
X-rays
from
such
patients.
Furthermore,
the
phenomena
described
here
may
well
indicate
important biological differences between IDC and
ILC but the nature of these differences is presently
obscure.

Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) l is a human autoimmune disease in which antibodies 
(IgG) are directed against the cell surface of epidermal cells with resultant blister 
formation (1). Patients with PF develop small blisters that quickly evolve into 
scaly and crusted skin lesions, often in a seborrheic distribution. Mucous mem- 
branes are usually not involved. The histopathology of the blisters demonstrates 
that cells in the superficial epidermis have detached from each other, a pathologic 
process called acantholysis (1, 2). Electron microscopic studies of early lesions of 
PF show diminished numbers (to complete loss) of desmosomes and abnormalities 
of the tonofilament-desmosome complex (2). Direct immunofluorescence dem- 
onstrates that IgG is bound to the cell surface of epidermal cells, and most 
patients also have circulating antibodies that bind to the surface of cells in normal 
epidermis as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. 
PF is clinically and histologically distinct from pemphigus vulgaris (PV), the 
other major form of pemphigus (1). Patients with PV typically have erosions of 
mucous membranes and often display erosions over large areas of the skin. 
Histology of the blister in PV demonstrates acantholysis deep in the epidermis, 
as opposed to the superficial blister seen in PF. The ultrastructural descriptions 
of the blisters in PF and PV also differ. In contrast to the desmosomal abnor- 
malities described in early blisters of PF, electron microscopy of blisters in PV 
demonstrates initial loss of cell cohesion between intact desmosomes (3). 
Patients with PV, like those with PF, usually have both in vivo-bound and 
circulating antibodies to the cell surface of epidermal cells (1, 4). However, we 
have recently shown (5) that the molecular specificities of PV and PF antibodies 
are distinct. Autoantibodies from different PV patients bind the same molecule, 
a glycoprotein with disulfide-linked chains of 130,000 and 80,000 mol wt, 
synthesized by epidermal cells in culture (5, 6). PF antibodies, in general, do not 
bind this molecule. On the other hand, circulating antibodies from about half of

1510 PEMPH1GUS FOLIACEUS ANTIBODIES BIND A DESMOSOMAL PROTEIN 
PF patients, but not from PV patients, react strongly with a 160,000 mol wt 
polypeptide extracted from normal human epidermis and identified as a broad 
band by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(PAGE). 2 
Desmoglein (DG) I (also called desmosome group 3 protein) is a desmosomal 
core glycoprotein with a molecular weight similar to that of PF antigen (7-12). 
By SDS-PAGE analysis, DGI isolated from bovine muzzle desmosomes appears 
as a broad band at -150,000-175,000 mol wt (7-12). On gradient gels, this 
band can sometimes be resolved into a triplet of three closely spaced bands that 
are immunologically and chemically related (9). DGI is considered a core protein 
of the desmosome because it is enriched in desmosome core preparations (7) 
and, in addition, preliminary immunoelectron microscopic studies have localized 
DGI to the intercellular space (core) of the desmosome (13). Immunofluorescence 
studies with antibodies to DGI that were isolated from bovine muzzle desmosomes 
have demonstrated DGI in human epidermis (11). 
Since DGI and PF antigen are of similar molecular weight, and because PF is 
a disease of cell adhesion with desmosomal abnormalities, we sought to determine 
in this study if the PF antibodies that bind the 160,000 mol wt protein extracted 
from normal human skin are directed against DGI. We demonstrate that auto- 
antibodies from these PF patients, but not from PV patients, are directed against 
this desmosomal core glycoprotein. 
Materials and Methods 
Human Epidermal and Desmosomal Extracts. 
Normal human epidermis, obtained by 
excising the roofs of suction blisters induced on the volar forearm of volunteers, was 
extracted with sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.0625 M Tris-HCI, pH 6.8) (14). Desmosomes 
were isolated from bovine muzzle using nonionic detergent in citrate buffer and differ- 
ential centrifugation, as previously described (7). The desmosomal pellet was extracted 
with sample buffer in preparation for SDS-PAGE. 
One-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis. One-dimensional SDS- 
PAGE, under reducing conditions, was performed on 5 or 6% acrylamide slab gels as 
described by Laemmli (15). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was essentially performed 
as described by O'Farrell (16), modified by Ames and Nikaido (17) for proteins extracted 
with SDS. In brief, the epidermal extract in sample buffer was diluted with 2 vol of 9.5 
M urea, 2% ampholines (LKB Produkter, Bromma, Sweden), pH 3.5-9.5, 10 mM 
dithiothreitol, and 8% Nonidet P-40. Isoelectric focusing was then performed in 4% 
acrylamide tube gels at 300 V overnight, then at 600 V for 1 h. The tubes were then 
equilibrated with 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol in 
sample buffer, and placed horizontally on top of a 4% acrylamide stacking gel on a 5% 
acrylamide running gel for SDS-PAGE. The proteins thus resolved in two dimensions 
were then used for immunoblotting. 
lmmunoblotting. 
To identify PF antigen and DGI, we used a previously described 
immunoblotting procedure (5, 14). In brief, proteins that were extracted either from 
normal human epidermis or from bovine muzzle desmosomes were separated by one- or 
two-dimensional electrophoresis, then electrophoreticaily transferred to either nitrocel- 
lulose sheets or 2-aminophenylthioether (APT) paper, which binds proteins covalently. 
Proteins were then identified using immunoperoxidase staining with specific antibodies. 
Sera, which have been previously described, from patients with histologically confirmed 
PF, were used to identify PF antigen (5). By indirect immunofluorescence on normal 
human skin or monkey esophagus, these sera stained in a cell surface pattern throughout

the epithelium with a titer of >40. As controls, sera from patients with PV, with equiva- 
lent immunofluorescent titers as previously reported (5), and normal human sera were 
used. A rabbit antiserum raised to isolated bovine muzzle desmosomes (7) was used to 
identify various desmosomal proteins. DGI, isolated from bovine muzzle desmosomal 
cores by SDS-PAGE, was used to raise a rabbit antiserum. This antiserum, called RpDGI- 
1, specifically stains DGI and not other desmosomal proteins (12). 
Affinity Purification of Antibodies Binding PF Antigen. Affinity purification was accom- 
plished as previously described (5). In short, PF serum was incubated with epidermal 
extracts that were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to APT paper. The antibodies 
which bound the 160,000 mol wt PF antigen were eluted using 0.5 M NaC1, 0.5 M acetic 
acid, pH 2.5, and then neutralized and concentrated. These affinity-purified antibodies 
were used for immunobiotting to stain DGI. 
Results 
Antibodies from Certain PF Patients Specifically Bind a 160,000 Mol Wt Pro- 
tein. 
Proteins in extracts of normal human epidermis were separated by SDS- 
PAGE, then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose or APT paper. 
Lanes of separated protein were cut out and stained by the use of an immuno- 
peroxidase technique. Fig. 1 demonstrates that, consistent with our previous 
findings (5), sera from three of four PF patients demonstrate a strong reaction 
with a 160,000 mol wt polypeptide that appears as a broad band. PV sera and 
normal human sera do not stain this band. To date, we have tested 13 PF sera, 
9 PV sera, 9 normal human sera, and sera from 9 patients with bullous pemphi- 
goid, which is another autoimmune blistering disease of the epidermis. Consistent 
and heavy staining of this 160,000 mol wt band was obtained with 6 of the 13 
PF sera, but with none of the other sera, used as controls. These data indicate 
that circulating antibodies to this specific polypeptide, that is extracted from 
normal human epidermis, are characteristic of a subgroup of PF patients. We 
will refer to this molecule as PF antigen. 
FIGURE 1. Certain PF sera specifically bind an -160,000 mol wt polypeptide (PF antigen) 
extracted from normal human epidermis. Proteins in extracts of normal human epidermis 
were separated by SDS-PAGE (5% acrylamide). A Coomassie Blue stain of the separated 
proteins is shown in the lane marked CB. Identical lanes of proteins were electrophoretically 
transferred to APT paper and then immunoperoxidase staining was performed with PF sera. 
(Different numbers indicate sera from different patients). Sera from patients with PV (another 
autoimmune blistering disease of the skin which is clinically, histologically, and immunochem- 
ically distinct from PF) and normal human sera (N) were used as specificity controls. Molecular 
weight standards (myosin, phosphorylase B, albumin) that were run concurrently (not shown) 
were used to calculate the apparent molecular weight of the stained band. Three of the four 
PF sera shown specifically stained a broad polypeptide band at ~ 160,000 mol wt (arrow).

Fig. 2 shows immunoblot analysis of proteins, from extracts of

against isolated bovine muzzle desmosomes identify polypeptides with molecular 
weights similar to the bovine muzzle desmoplakins (DP), proteins found in the 
desmosome plaque (8, 10, 18), and desmogleins (DG), glycoproteins that are 
enriched in desmosomal core preparations (7, 9, 12). (Fig. 2, lane 1). PF 
antibodies identify PF antigen (Fig. 2, lane 3), which co-migrates with DGI. The 
antibody RpDGI-1, raised in rabbits to DGI from bovine muzzle desmosomes, 
identifies the DGI in these immunoblots (Fig. 2, lane 5). PF antigen (Fig. 2, lanes 
7, 8), identified by PF sera, co-migrates with DGI. The apparent molecular 
weight of these molecules from human epidermis is 160,000, slightly higher than 
the 150,000 mol wt reported for DGI from bovine muzzle desmosomes; however, 
slight differences in molecular weight of desmosomal proteins in different tissues 
have been previously reported (10, 12). The specificity of the binding of both 
PF antibodies and RpDGI-1 is demonstrated by the findings that: (a) they both 
stain only one minor protein band of the many bands (Fig. 2, lane 11) that were 
transferred to the APT paper, and (b) normal human sera (Fig. 2, lanes 4, 9, 10) 
and normal rabbit sera, (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 6), used as controls, do not stain this 
band.

of normal human epidermis were separated by isoelectric focusing in the first

separated were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets for immunoperoxidase stain- 
ing. Fig. 3 demonstrates that PF antibodies and antibodies to DGI stain the same 
spots at apparent molecular weight 160,000 and pH 5.4-5.7. Normal human 
serum and normal rabbit serum, used as controls, do not stain these spots. Taken 
together, these data indicate that rabbit antibodies to the bovine muzzle desmo- 
somal glycoprotein DGI recognize the PF antigen extracted from normal human 
epidermis. 
PF Antibodies Bind DGI Extracted from Bovine Muzzle Desmosomes. Extracts of 
isolated bovine muzzle desmosomes, electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, demon- 
strate multiple polypeptide bands including DPI, DPII, DGI, DGII, and DPIII 
(7-10, 12, 18) (Fig. 4, lane 1). Of these polypeptides, PF serum specifically 
stained DGI (Fig. 4, lane 2). PV serum and normal human serum, used as 
controls, did not stain any of these polypeptide bands (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). 
Three of the four PF sera tested in similar experiments specifically stained DGI. 
The failure of one PF serum to stain the DGI from bovine muzzle desmosomes 
may be due to species specificity of this antibody. 
In additional experiments, PF antibodies were affinity purified using PF 
antigen extracted from normal human epidermis and bound to APT paper, 
which binds proteins covalently. These antibodies, eluted from the PF antigen 
160,000 mol wt band and used for indirect immunofluorescence, stain sections 
of normal human skin in an epidermal cell surface pattern identical to that seen

lane (lane I) was stained with amido black to determine the position of the proteins. Using 
lane 1 as a guide, we cut out 4-mm-diam circles from unstained lane 2 at the location of the 
150,000 mol wt band (DGI) and the 240,000 mol wt band (DPI). Immunoperoxidase staining 
of lane 2 was then performed with a rabbit antibody raised to desmosomes isolated from 
bovine muzzle. The staining, shown here, demonstrates that the circles were indeed cut out 
from the 150,000 mol wt and the 240,000 tool wt bands. The circles (shown under 3) were 
subjected to immunoperoxidase staining with PF IgG that was affinity purified on PF antigen 
extracted from normal human epidermis. The affinity-purified PF IgG stained the 150,000 
tool wt (DGI) circle, but not the 240,000 mol wt (DPI) circle, which was used as a control.

Discussion 
This report demonstrates that both antibodies to the desmosomal core protein 
DGI isolated from bovine muzzle desmosomes and autoantibodies from certain 
KOULU ET AL. 
1515 
PF patients bind to the same -160,000 mol wt polypeptide extracted from 
normal human epidermis. Moreover, these PF antibodies also bound to DGI 
extracted from bovine muzzle desmosomes. Taken together, these data indicate 
that autoantibodies to a desmosomal core protein, DGI, are found in some 
patients with PF, a disease characterized by loss of adhesion of epidermal cells. 
It is tempting to speculate that these autoantibodies might directly contribute to 
this acantholysis. However, if these antibodies do cause loss of cell adhesion, why 
are lesions only seen in the superficial epidermis and not in other areas of the 
epidermis, and not in other epithelial tissues that also contain desmosomes? 
Several possible explanations exist: (a) There are probably many molecules 
important in cell-to-cell adhesion. If DGI is, in fact, one of them, its relative 
contribution to cell adhesion may be greater in the superficial epidermis than in 
other tissue locations. (b) Although related proteins, including DGI, are seen in 
desmosomes from different epithelial tissues, there are tissue-specific chemical 
differences among them (10, 12). In addition, subtle differences, related to the 
degree of keratinization, may exist between desmosomes at different levels of 
the epidermis (2, 19, 20). Thus, antibodies may interact differently with desmo- 
somes in different locations. (c) Antibodies may not directly interfere with cell 
adhesion, but may act through other mechanisms which themselves might be 
tissue specific. For example, in PV, which is also an autoimmune disease of 
epidermal cell adhesion, autoantibodies that bind to the epidermal cell surface 
trigger the release of one or more proteolytic enzymes which subsequently result 
in acantholysis (21-26). This mechanism has also been shown to be operative in 
some cases of PF (25). Whether this mechanism holds for the subgroup of PF 
patients with autoantibodies to DGI is not known. 
In evaluating previous reports (1, 5, 6) that address the question of pemphigus 
antibody reactivity with desmosomes, it is crucial to consider that PV and PF are 
clinically, histologically, and immunochemically distinct diseases. Furthermore, 
even sera from different PF patients may demonstrate antigenic heterogeneity, 
as shown in the present and a previous report (5). These considerations may 
account for the seemingly contradictory findings, regarding pemphigus antibod- 
ies and desmosomes, of different studies. For example, Jones et al. (28), using 
antidesmosomai and pemphigus antibodies in an immunofluorescence assay, 
recently reported that pemphigus sera bind to desmosomes of mouse epidermal 
cells in culture. These findings may be consistent with the present report, but it 
would be important to know the type of pemphigus sera used. On the other 
hand, Gorbsky et al. (29), using an enzyme-linked immunoassay of bovine 
desmosomai proteins and immunofluorescence of monkey esophagus, concluded 
that PV antibodies do not bind to desmosomal proteins. This conclusion is also 
consistent with the findings of the present study that only certain PF, but no PV, 
antibodies bind to a desmosomal glycoprotein. 
The precise relationship of the antidesmosomal antibodies in some PF patients 
to the pathophysiology of the disease remains to be determined. Antibodies to 
desmosomes may not be related to the pathogenesis of the disease, but may 
instead be secondary to autoimmunization once the disease is active. This 
explanation seems unlikely because both PV and PF antibodies are capable of 
causing blister formation (25, 30). Although the precise pathophysiology of PF 
1516 PEMPHIGUS FOLIACEUS ANTIBODIES BIND A DESMOSOMAL PROTEIN 
is not known, the present study suggests that autoantibodies found in some PF 
patients may interfere with cell adhesion mediated by a desmosomal core protein. 
Additional study of this human autoimmune disease should further our under- 
standing of the function of this desmosomal molecule. 
Summary 
Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is a human autoimmune disease in which antibodies 
are directed against the cell surface of epidermal cells with resultant blister 
formation. The histopathology of these blisters indicates that cells have detached 
from each other, and electron microscopy of early blisters shows diminished 
numbers, to complete loss, of desmosomes as well as abnormalities of the 
tonofilament-desmosome complex. In this study we demonstrate that autoanti- 
bodies from certain PF patients bind to a desmosomal core glycoprotein called 
desmoglein (DG) I. Proteins in extracts of normal human epidermis were sepa- 
rated by sodium dodecyi sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(PAGE), then transferred to nitrocellulose or 2-aminophenylthioether paper for 
immunoperoxidase staining. Results of these immunoblots indicated that sera 
from 6 of 13 PF patients specifically and intensely stained an -160,000 mol wt 
polypeptide, ""PF antigen"". Such staining was not seen with normal human sera 
or sera from patients with pemphigus vulgaris or bullous pemphigoid, two 
autoimmune blistering skin diseases that are clinically, histologically, and immu- 
nochemically distinct from PF. However, rabbit antiserum directed against DGI, 
that was isolated from bovine muzzle desmosomes, stained a polypeptide band 
which co-migrated with PF antigen. Furthermore, when proteins from extracts 
of normal human epidermis were electrophoresed in two dimensions (isoelectric 
focusing, then SDS-PAGE) before transfer to nitrocellulose for immunoperoxi- 
dase staining, PF antibodies and antibodies to DGI stained identical spots. Finally, 
PF sera as well as PF IgG that was affinity purified with PF antigen from normal 
human epidermis, both selectively bound to DGI extracted from bovine muzzle 
desmosomes. These studies demonstrate that the human autoantibodies from 
certain patients with PF, a disease of epidermal cell adhesion, are directed against 
a desmosomal core protein.

Lyme disease was recognized as a separate entity because of close geographic clusterilng of
affected children in Lyme, Connecticut, with what was thouglht to be juveniile rheumatoid ar-
thritis. It then became apparent that Lyme disease is a complex, multisystem disorder. The
illness usually begins in summer with erythema chroniicum migrans and associated symptoms
(stage 1). Weeks to montlhs later, some patients develop neurologic or cardiac abnormalities
(stage 2), and weeks to years later, many patients develop intermittenit attacks of arthritis (stage
3), wlhichl may become chroniic, witlh erosion of cartilage and bone. Patients with severe anid
prolonged illness have an increased frequency of the B-cell alloantigeni, DR2. For patients with
early Lyme disease, tetracycline appears to be the most effective drug, theni penicillini, anid
finally erythromycin. High-dose intravenous penicillin is effective for the later stages of the
disease.
RECOGNITION OF THE DISEASE
We first learned about what was to become Lyme disease in October 1975 from
two mothers who reported to the Connecticut State Health Department that a
number of children who lived close together in Lyme, Connecticut, were thought to
have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) [1]. To investigate these reports, physicians
at the Health Department and the Yale University Rheumatology Section organized
a surveillance system through contacts with the mothers, area physicians, school
nurses, and local health officers in the three contiguous communities of Old Lyme,
Lyme, and East Haddam (total population, 12,000). In those communities, we at-
tempted to identify all children with inflammatory joint disease and invited them to
participate in a study at the Yale University School of Medicine where a history,
physical examination, and blood tests were done in an effort to determine the cause
of their arthritis.
We found 39 such children. All of them had an apparently similar type of arthritis
characterized by brief but recurrent attacks of asymmetric swelling and pain in a few
large joints, especially the knee, over a period of years. Twelve adults, who were
either parents or neighbors of affected children, were found to have a similar type of

arthritis. Although individual attacks of arthritis were often shorter than those
usually seen in juvenile arthritis, it was difficult to separate the illness in Lyme
residents from that entity on the basis of joint involvement alone.
However, the epidemiologic analysis of affected residents was striking. The
overall prevalence rate of the disease was 4.3 per 1,000 residents; among children, it
was 12.2 per 1,000, a frequency at least 100 times greater than that of JRA [2]. Even
within these communities, close geographic clustering of cases was observed. Half of
the affected Lyme residents lived in heavily wooded areas on two adjoining country
roads, as did half of those affected in East Haddam. One in ten children living on
those four roads had the illness. In addition, clustering within families was ob-
served; six families had more than one affected member. The onset of the arthritis in
the 51 patients occurred during a four-year period from July 1972 through May 1976
(the cutoff time for the initial study); the majority (55 percent) noted the onset in
summer or early fall. In families with more than one affected member, those af-
fected usually had the onset of symptoms in different years. These epidemiologic
features seemed most compatible with an arthropod-transmitted illness.
Moreover, during a median of four weeks before the onset of arthritis, 13 patients
(25 percent) noted an erythematous papule, thought to be an insect bite, that
developed into an expanding, red annular lesion. Only two of the 159 family
members of patients had such a lesion but did not develop arthritis (p <0.0000001).
The lesion sounded most compatible with erythema chronicum migrans (ECM), de-
scribed in Europe in 1909 [3]. There the lesion was associated with the bite of Ixodes
ricinus ticks [4] and with subsequent neurologic abnormalities [5,6] but not with ar-
thritis. Cultures and serologic tests in our patients did not suggest infection with ar-
boviruses or any other agents known to cause arthritis. Thus, we thought that the ill-
ness in Lyme residents was a previously unrecognized clincial entity and called it
""Lyme arthritis.""
CLINICAL PICTURE
During the following summer of 1976, we identified, for the first time, patients
with the skin lesion, confirmed its similarity to ECM in Europe, and followed the
patients prospectively [7]. Many of them subsequently developed arthritis, but some
also acquired neurologic or cardiac abnormalities [8,9]. Thus, Lyme arthritis
became recognized as a complex, multisystem disorder, and the name was changed
to Lyme disease.
During the seven summers of 1976 through 1982, 314 patients with ECM were
studied prospectively at Yale [10]. Their ages ranged from 2 to 88 years (median, 28
years), and the sex ratio was nearly one to one. Onset of the illness was generally be-
tween May 1 and November 30; the majority of onsets were in June or July [10]. The
following description of the illness is based primarily on the study of these patients.
Early Manifestations
Erythema chronicum migrans, the best clinical marker for Lyme disease, usually
begins as a red macule or papule [7,10]. Approximately 30 percent of the patients
remember a tick bite at the site of the lesion within 3 to 32 days before it forms there.
As the area of redness around the center expands, most lesions continue to have
bright red outer borders and partial central clearing (PLATE i). However, in some pa-
tients, ECM is less characteristic. The centers of early lesions sometimes become in-
tensely erythematous and indurated, as in streptococcal cellulitis; or the center
becomes vesicular and necrotic, as in tularemia. In some instances, migrating lesions
454

THE CLINICAL SPECTRUM AND TREATMENT OF LYME DISEASE
remain an even intense red, several red rings are found within the outside one, or the
central area turns blue before it clears. Although the lesion can be located anywhere,
the thigh, groin, and axilla are particularly common sites. The lesion is hot to touch,
but often not painful. Histologically, the center of ECM shows dermal and epider-
mal changes, but only dermal changes in the periphery (Fig. 1), findings suggestive
of an arthropod bite.
In some patients, the disease remains localized to a single skin lesion accompanied
by minor constitutional symptoms -malaise and fatigue, headache, fever and chills,
and regional lymphadenopathy. The illness in these patients seems very similar to
ECM as described in Europe [3,4]. However, unlike the European experience, the
disease here often seems to disseminate [10]. Within several days after onset of the
initial skin lesion (ECM), many patients develop multiple annular secondary lesions
(PLATE II). Although their appearance is similar to initial lesions, they are generally
smaller, migrate less, and lack indurated centers; they are not associated with
previous tick bites. Patients with secondary lesions may be thought to have erythema
multiforme; however, in Lyme disease we have not seen blistering, mucosal lesions,
or involvement of the palms and soles. During this period, some patients develop
other dermatologic findings including malar rash, conjunctivitis, urticaria, or small
evanescent red blotches and circles.
Patients with disseminated disease sometimes have evidence of meningeal irrita-
tion, mild encephalopathy, migratory musculoskeletal pain, hepatitis, generalized
lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, sore throat, non-productive cough, or testicular
swelling [10]. Except for lethargy and fatigue, which are often constant and may be
incapacitating, the early signs and symptoms are typically intermittent and chang-
ing. For example, a patient might experience predominantly headache and stiff neck
for several days. After a few days of improvement, musculoskeletal pain might
begin.
During this stage, the commonest non-specific laboratory abnormalities are a high
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (53 percent of patients), an elevated total serum IgM
level (33 percent), or an increased serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
level (19 percent) [10]. The latter finding supports the clinical impression that mild
hepatitis may be a feature of early Lyme disease. A few patients have microscopic
hematuria, sometimes with mild proteinuria (dipstick), which has been the only
evidence of renal involvement. Regardless of treatment, the signs and symptoms of

stage one usually fade within three to four weeks (range,
1 day to 14 months).
However, the dermatologic manifestations of the illness sometimes recur.
Later Manifestations
Nervous System
Symptoms suggestive of meningeal irritation sometimes occur
at the beginning of the illness when ECM is present [10]. Such individuals often have
episodic attacks of excruciating headache and neck pain, stiffness, or pressure
typically lasting hours. During the first one or two weeks of illness, such symptoms
are not associated with a spinal fluid pleocytosis or objective neurologic deficit.
However, after several weeks to months, about 15 percent of patients develop frank
neurologic abnormalities. The usual triad of symptoms consists of meningitis, cra-
nial neuropathy (particularly Bell's palsy), and peripheral radiculoneuropathy.
However, any of these manifestations may occur alone [8]. In untreated patients,
neurologic abnormalities typically last for months but usually resolve completely.
Heart
Within several weeks after the onset of illness, about 8 percent of patients
develop cardiac involvement [9]. The commonest abnormality is fluctuating degrees
of atrioventricular block (first degree, Wenckebach, or complete heart block). Some
patients have evidence of more diffuse cardiac involvement
including
elec-
trocardiographic changes compatible with acute myopericarditis,
radionuclide
evidence of mild left ventricular dysfunction or, rarely, cardiomegaly. The duration
of cardiac involvement is usually brief (three days to six weeks) and rarely recurs.
The clinical picture in these patients has similarities to acute rheumatic fever, but in
Lyme disease, complete heart block may be more common, myopericardial involve-
ment tends to be milder, and valves seem not to be affected.
Joints
Within a few weeks to two years after the onset of illness, about 60 per-
cent of patients develop arthritis [7,11,12]. If joint involvement occurs early in the
illness, the typical pattern is one of migratory musculoskeletal pain in joints, ten-
dons, bursae, muscle, or bone, often without joint swelling. The pain tends to affect
only one or two sites at a time and usually lasts a few hours to several days in a given
location. Frank arthritis with marked joint swelling usually does not begin until
months after the onset of the illness. At that time, patients often experience intermit-
tent attacks of joint swelling and pain, primarily in large joints, especially the knee,
usually one or two joints at a time. Affected knees are commonly much more
swollen than painful, often hot, rarely red; Baker's cysts sometimes form and rup-
ture early. However, both large and small joints may be affected and a few patients
have had symmetrical polyarthritis, as in rheumatoid arthritis. Attacks of arthritis,
which generally last from a few weeks to months, typically recur for several years.
Late in the illness, fatigue is common with active joint involvement, but fever or
other systemic symptoms are unusual. Joint fluid white cell counts vary from 500 to
110,000 cells/mm3 with mostly polymorphonuclear leukocytes [7]. Total protein
ranges from 3 to 8 g/dl. C3 and C4 levels are generally greater than one-third and
glucose levels usually greater than two-thirds of that of serum.
In about 10 percent of patients with arthritis, involvement in large joints becomes
chronic, with erosion of cartilage and bone [11,12]. Synovial biopsies show surface
deposits of fibrin, villous hypertrophy, vascular proliferation, and a heavy infiltra-
tion of mononuclear cells, including plasma cells presumably capable of producing
antibody locally (Fig. 2) [7,11,12]. In one patient with chronic Lyme arthritis,
synovium grown in tissue culture produced large amounts of collagenase and pros-
taglandin E2 [12]. Thus, in Lyme disease, the joint fluid cell counts, the immune
reactants (except for rheumatoid factor), the synovial histology, the amounts of

Variations in Clinical Manifestations
We have come to think of Lyme disease as an illness that occurs in stages, with
remissions and exacerbations and different clinical manifestations at each stage
(Table 1). The disorder usually begins with ECM and associated symptoms (stage 1).
Weeks to months later, some patients develop neurologic or cardiac abnormalities
(stage 2), and weeks to years later, many patients develop arthritis (stage 3).
However, it should be emphasized that marked variation is possible in the clinical
expression of the disease. Even without treatment, some patients have very mild
disease (e.g., ECM alone with no other manifestations). At the opposite end of the
spectrum, an occasional patient will have severe involvement of skin, nerves, heart,
and joints at the same time. Incomplete disease pictures are also possible. Some pa-
tients lack ECM but have other non-specific symptoms associated with stage one.
These patients are often thought to have viral infections. In other patients, stage one
is asymptomatic and the presenting signs of the disease are neurologic or joint in-
volvement. These patients may be diagnosed as having aseptic meningitis, rheuma-
toid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, or Reiter's syndrome.
The development of severe and prolonged illness is associated with a particular
genetic susceptibility [11,13]. In a study of 45 patients at the two ends of the clinical
spectrum of Lyme disease, those with severe and prolonged illness (ECM followed
by meningitis or chronic arthritis) had an increased frequency of the B-cell alloan-
tigen, DR2 (67 percent of patients) compared to 36 percent of those with mild and
brief illness (ECM alone) (odds ratio = 3.4, p< 0.05) or to 25 percent of those in a

normal population (odds ratio = 6, p<0.0001). Thus, Lyme disease seems to fit
within a pathogenetic framework thought to be important in several rheumatic
diseases; namely, in genetically susceptible individuals, certain infectious agents may
be associated with a characteristic immune response that leads to arthritis.
TREATMENT
We initially suspected that Lyme disease was a viral illness. However, in Europe,
where associated arthritis was unknown, ECM was said to respond to antibiotic
therapy [14,151, and case reports supporting that conclusion had also appeared in
the United States [16,17]. Therefore, during the 1977 and 1979 summers, we gave
antibiotics to patients with active ECM and compared the results with those in un-
treated patients from the summers of 1976 and 1978. Based on these observations,
we reported that penicillin, given early in the illness, shortened the duration of ECM
and appeared to prevent or attenuate subsequent arthritis [18].
To further clarify these findings, during 1980 and 1981, 108 patients with early
Lyme disease were assigned treatment randomly with phenoxymethyl penicillin,
erythromycin, or tetracycline, in each instance 250 mg four times a day for ten days
[19]. The patients in each group had similar age and sex distributions, and the mean
duration in each from the onset of illness to the beginning of antibiotic therapy was
nine to ten days. Fourteen percent of patients, generally those with more severe
disease, had an intensification of symptoms during the first 24 hours after the start
of therapy. This Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction occurred more often with penicil-
lin and tetracycline than with erythromycin, presumably because of faster killing of
larger numbers of organisms.
ECM and its associated symptoms resolved significantly faster in penicillin- or
tetracycline-treated patients than in those given erythromycin (mean duration, 5.4
and 5.7 versus 9.2 days, F = 3.38, p < 0.05) [19]. In addition, fewer patients given
penicillin (5 percent) or tetracycline (8 percent) than those treated with erythromycin
(17 percent) required retreatment (ten more days of antibiotics) because of per-
sistence of symptoms or immediate relapse. More important, none of the 39 patients
given tetracycline developed major
late complications (myocarditis, meningo-
encephalitis, or recurrent attacks of arthritis) compared with 3 of 40 penicillin-
treated patients (8 percent) and 4 of 29 given erythromycin (14 percent) (p = 0.07).
In 1982, all 49 adult patients were given tetracycline; again, none of them developed
major complications. Thus, for adults early in the illness, tetracycline, 250 mg four
times a day, seems to be the drug of choice, followed by phenoxymethyl penicillin,
500 mg four times a day, and erythromycin, 250 mg four times a day, in each in-
stance for at least ten days or for up to 20 days if symptoms persist or recur [19]. In
children, we recommend phenoxymethyl penicillin 50 mg/kg/d (not less than 1 g/d
or more than 2 g/d) in divided doses for the same duration or, in cases of penicillin
allergy, erythromycin, 30 mg/kg/d, in divided doses for 15 or 20 days.
Regardless of the antibiotic agent given, nearly half of patients still experienced
minor late complications-recurrent episodes of headache or pain in joints, ten-
dons, bursae, or muscles, often accompanied by lethargy [19]. Their physical ex-
aminations were usually normal. Symptoms were often reminiscent of those ex-
perienced at the beginning of the illness, but were generally briefer and less severe.
They correlated significantly with the initial severity of the illness. In a given attack,
pain usually occurred in one or two sites and lasted from hours to days. With fre-
quent attacks, the pain was often migratory. Such attacks sometimes recurred for
several years. The pathogenesis of these symptoms is unknown. A severely depleted

number of live spirochetes may continue to produce these less serious but sometimes
debilitating symptoms. Alternately, they may not require the persistence of an intact
spirochete.
Can the later manifestations of Lyme disease be treated with antibiotic therapy?
In 1981 and 1982, we treated 12 patients with intravenous penicillin, 20 million U a
day in divided doses, for neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease [20]. Headache,
stiff neck, and radicular pain usually began to subside by the second day of therapy
and were often gone by seven to ten days. Compared to 15 previous patients treated
with prednisone alone, the duration of meningitic symptoms was significalntly
shorter in those given penicillin (mean duration, one versus 29 weeks, p < 0.0000001).
However, in both groups a mean of seven to eight weeks was required for complete
recovery of motor deficits. Thus, we concluded that high-dose intravenous penicillin
is effective therapy for neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease. However, similar
to the experience with oral antibiotics for ECM, 3 of the 12 patients continued to
have frequent arthralgias, musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue despite penicillin
therapy.

practice is to include aspirin therapy, generally 3.6 g/d, or prednisone, 40 to 60
mg/d, if the patient has complete heart block and cardiomegaly [9].
Established Lyme arthritis can also be treated successfully with high-dose intra-
venous penicillin [21]. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, seven of 16 pa-
tients who received intramuscular benzathine penicillin remained well afterward, but
all 20 patients given saline continued to have attacks of arthritis (p = 0.001). In a
subsequent study, 13 of 20 patients given penicillin G, 20 million U a day intra-
venously for ten days, have remained well, including both patients who were Bicillin
faihires.

Knowledge about the surface antigens of malignant melanoma has grown rapidly 
since the advent of monoclonal antibodies (1-5). A large number of cell lines derived 
from melanomas have now been established, and these have facilitated the serological 
analysis of melanoma surface antigens. Many of the melanoma antigens that have 
been identified with mouse monoclonal antibodies are not expressed by all melanoma 
lines but show instead a differential pattern of expression that defines melanoma 
subsets on the basis of surface antigenic phenotype. It seems likely that this diversity 
of melanoma phenotype reflects a corresponding diversity in the surface phenotype of 
normal cells undergoing melanocyte differentiation. To pursue this idea, we analyzed 
the surface antigens of melanocytes, using a recently described method for growing 
melanocytes from normal skin (6). Most, but not all, of the antigens initially detected 
on melanomas were also detected on melanocytes, and the pattern of antigen 
expression on newborn and adult melanocytes could be distinguished. From these 
studies of melanocytes and melanomas, we propose a scheme of surface antigenic 
changes occurring during melanocyte differentiation and a classification of melanoma 
based on expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens. 
Materials and Methods 
Melanocyte Cultures. Skin from face, trunk, or thigh of 16 adults, foreskin of 14 newborns, 
and skin from the trunk of a 12-wk fetus served as the source of melanocytes. Cultures of 
melanocytes were grown in the presence of the phorbol ester, TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 
13-acetate) 10 ng/ml (Consolidated Midland Corp., Brewster, NY), and 1 × 10 -s M cholera 
toxin (Schwartz/Mann Div., Becton, Dickinson & Co., Orangeburg, NY), according to previ- 
ously published procedures (6). 
Melanoma Cultures. For derivation of melanoma cell lines, see ref 7. Cultures were maintained 
in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
or 8% newborn calf serum mixed with 2% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 #g/ml streptomycin. Cultures were regularly tested for myco- 
plasma, and contaminated cultures were discarded. Five melanoma cell lines were tested 
between passage one and three (SK-MEL-65,163,164,165,173), while the remaining cell lines 
were tested after passage 8, usually between passages 15 and 50. In addition, eight melanoma 
cell lines (SK-MEL-13,19,28,37,64,127,130, and MeWo) were grown in the presence of TPA 
(10 ng/ml) and cholera toxin (1 X 10 -s M) for 2-3 wk to determine the effect of these growth 
factors on surface antigen expression.

assays were performed as described previously (3, 8). Indicator cells were prepared by conju- 
gating purified anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) or protein A 
(Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Div. of Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, N J) to human erythrocytes 
using 0.01% chromium chloride. Assays were performed in Falcon 3040 Microtest II plates 
(Falcon Labware, Div. of Becton, Dickinson & Co., Oxnard, CA). Sera were incubated with 
target cells for 1 h at 20°C. Target cells were then washed, and indicator cells were added for 
1 h. Plates were washed and evaluated for rosetting by light microscopy. Titers corresponded 
to the serum dilution giving 50% positive target cells. Absorption tests were carried out as 
described (3, 7, 8). 
Serological Reagents (See Table I). Monoclonal antibodies were derived from spleen cells of 
mice immunized with melanoma, glioma, renal cancer, or melanocyte cell cultures (3, 9, I0; A. 
Houghton and A. Albino, unpublished results), nu/nu mice (Swiss background) were inoculated 
with cloned hybridomas, and sera from tumor-bearing mice were used for serological analysis.

These sera had maximum titers of ~-~10 -4, and usually >10 -5, with melanoma or melanocyte 
cultures. With the exception of M-18 antibody, which was detected by PA assays, all other 
mouse monoclonal antibodies were analyzed using the anti-Ig assay. Monoclonal antibodies 
known to identify the same epitope or different epitopes on the same molecule were grouped 
under the same antigenic system; M-19 antigen is a 95-kd glycoprotein detected by four mouse 
monoclonal antibodies, M-20 represents a 130-kd glycoprotein detected by five different mouse 
monoclonal antibodies, and M-23 is a glycoprotein dimer of 145 kd and 100 kd detected by two 
antibodies. Mouse monoclonal antibody and conventional rabbit antisera to/32-microglobulin 
(018b) were purchased from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY. Serological 
and biochemical characteristics of the human HLA-DR monoclonal antibody 13-17 have been 
published (1, 11). Antigen M-9 was detected by a naturally occurring antibody in the serum of 
a healthy individual; this antibody defines a melanocyte differentiation antigen, Mel-1, which 
is expressed by ~50% of melanoma cell lines (12). 
Tyrosinase Assay. Tyrosinase activity was measured using a modification of the assay 
described by Pomerantz (13). [3H]Tyrosine (specific activity, 53.1 Ci/mMol) was purchased 
from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). Cell lines to be tested were seeded at a density of 1 
X 10 6 cells per flask in 25 cm 2 Falcon flasks. After 12 h, medium was removed and replaced 
with 4 ml fresh medium containing 5 pCi [3H]tyrosine, and the cultures were incubated for an 
additional 24 h. Residual [3H]tyrosine in the medium was removed by adsorption to activated 
charcoal and passage over a Dowex 50w column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). 
Tritiated H20 (generated by tyrosinase activity) in the eluent was counted in triplicate in a LS 
9000 Beckman Scintillation Counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Tyrosinase 
activity was expressed as the ratio of tritiated H20 generated by melanoma cell lines per 
tritiated H20 generated by a control nonpigmented renal cancer cell line (SK-RC-7). 
Results 
Description of Antibodies Reactive with Cell Surface Antigens of Melanoma and Melanocytes. 
The panel of typing antibodies used in this study is described in Table I, and reactivity 
and titer of these antibodies with melanoma cell lines are shown in Table II. Fig. 1 
illustrates individual assays with antibodies detecting M-4, M-10, and HLA-DR 
antigens tested on three melanoma cell lines and two melanocyte cultures. 
A characteristic of the typing antibodies listed in Table I is that they generally 
react with only a proportion of the melanoma cell lines and therefore divide mela- 
nomas into distinguishable subsets on the basis of antigenic phenotypes. Antigens 
such as M-25 are expressed by most melanoma lines (23/26 lines), antigens M-4 and 
M-9 are detected on approximately one-half of the cell lines, and M-10 antigen is 
found on only 5 of 33 melanoma lines. With regard to major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) products, HLA-DR expression was found on 13 of 21 cell lines. 
Antibodies to HLA-A,B,C and/~2-microglobulin were highly reactive with nearly all 
melanoma cell lines; two lines, SK-MEL-19 and SK-MEL-33, showed no reaction. By 
absorption tests, these antigens were detectable on SK-MEL-19 but not on SK-MEL- 
33. 
Serological Typing of Fetal, Newborn, and Adult Melanocytes. Fig. 2 shows the morphol- 
ogy of melanocytes from newborn and adult skin. Fetal and newborn melanocytes 
grow as bipolar cells. In contrast, melanocytes from adult skin show a polydendritic 
morphology. Fig. 3 summarizes the results of serological tests with newborn and adult 
melanocytes. The reactivity of melanocytes derived from fetal skin was similar to 
newborn melanocytes. 
Melanocyte antigens detected by the panel of typing antibodies can be grouped 
into four categories: (a) not detected on newborn or adult melanocytes but expressed 
by subsets of melanoma: HLA-DR, M-l, M-2, and M-3; (b) detected on newborn 
melanocytes but not adult melanocytes: M-4 to M-8; (c) detected on adult melanocytes

tein that is expressed by renal cancer, normal kidney epithelium, and a limited 
number of nonrenal cells (9).

Fro. 3. Serological typing of newborn and adult melanocytes for melanoma cell surface antigens. 
Each circle represents an individual test, and each test for a particular antigen was performed with 
melanocytes from a different individual. In the case of tests with mouse monoclonal antibodies, 
black circles represent antibody titers 1:10 4 to 1:10 7, stippled circles 1:500 to 1:5,000, and open 
circles _<1:250. In tests with human typing serum detecting M-9 antigen, black circles represent 
titers 1:500 to 1:104, stippled circles 1:10 to 1:250, and open circles, no reaction. (<1:10). 
24 other monoclonal antibodies detecting a series of differentiation antigens on 
renal cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer and ABH blood group antigens were 
included in these tests. No reactions with newborn or adult melanocytes were observed. 
Influence of In Vitro Culture Conditions on Antigen Expression. 
Melanocytes require TPA 
and cholera toxin for at least the first 4 d of culture to stimulate melanocyte 
proliferation and to inhibit overgrowth of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. However, 
after this brief exposure, cultures can be maintained without growth factors for several 
weeks before melanocytes die or become overgrown by fibroblasts. To investigate the 
influence of growth factors on antigen expression, melanocytes were grown for 4 d in 
TPA and cholera toxin conditioned media and then for 3 wk in (a) culture medium 
without growth factors, (b) culture medium with either TPA or cholera toxin, or (c) 
culture medium with both TPA and cholera toxin. We did not observe any difference 
in antigen expression when melanocytes were cultured under these various conditions; 
HOUGHTON, EISINGER, ALBINO, CAIRNCROSS, AND OLD 
1761 
monoclonal antibodies detecting antigens M-1 through M-6, M-9, M-10, and M-34 
were used in these tests. Studies were also carried out to determine whether melanoma 
cell lines grown in the presence of TPA and cholera toxin would change their surface 
antigenic phenotype. Of the 28 antigenic systems tested on 8 melanoma cell lines, 
only M-34 antigen was influenced by the presence of growth factors; SK-MEL-19, 
which characteristically expresses little or no M-34 antigen, converted to M-34 + after 
growth in TPA and cholera toxin. 
To reduce the possibility that length of time in culture might alter antigen 
expression, most tests were carried out with melanocyte cultures between passage 1 
and 3. However, little difference in antigen expression was seen when melanocytes 
were tested later at passage 8, 12, or 19. M-4 and M-5 antigens, which are markers of 
newborn and fetal melanocytes, appear to be exceptions because they could not be 
\ 
detected on newborn melanocytes after five passages in culture. 
Subsets of Melanoma Cell Lines Defined by Melanocyte Differentiation Antigens. 
25 mela- 
noma cell lines were typed for the expression of M-2, M-3, HLA-DR, M-4, M-6, 
M-9 and M-10 antigens. These seven antigens were selected because they defined 
subsets of melanomas (present on some melanomas but not others) and had distinct 
patterns of expression on fetal/newborn and adult melanocytes. Three antigens, HLA- 
DR, M-2, and M-3, can be assumed to be early markers of melanocyte differentiation 
because they are expressed on melanomas but not on melanocytes. Antigens M-4 and 
M-6 appear on fetal and newborn melanocytes but not adult melanocytes and, 
therefore, signal an intermediate phase in melanocyte differentiation. M-9 and M-10 
appear to be late markers in the melanocyte lineage because they are strongly

Flo. 6. Proposed pathway of melanocyte differentiation based on surface antigenic phenotype and 
morphology. The phenotype of melanomas corresponding to early, intermediate, or late stages in 
the proposed melanocyte pathway is also illustrated. In this scheme, M-2, M-3, and HLA-DR 
antigens are early melanocyte markers, M-4, M-5, and M-6 antigens are intermediate markers, and 
M-9, and M-10 antigens are late melanocyte markers. M-18 antigen is found at all stages of 
melanocyte differentiation and is present on all melanoma cells. 
expressed on adult melanocytes as compared with fetal and newborn melanocytes. 
The surface phenotypes of the 25 melanoma lines appear to correspond to early, 
intermediate, or late phases of melanocyte differentiations. 5 melanomas expressed 
only early markers, 10 intermediate markers, and 10 late melanocyte markers (Fig. 4). 
Evidence for the significance of these differences comes from a comparison of the 
pattern of surface antigens with other differentiation characteristics, such as pigmen- 
tation, morphology, and tyrosinase (Fig. 4). The majority of melanomas expressing 
early antigenic markers are epithelioid (Fig. 5a), and these melanoma lines lack 
pigmentation and tyrosinase activity. Fig. 5b shows the morphology of a cell line 
belonging to the intermediate group, and the resemblance to the bipolar morphology 
of melanocytes from fetal and newborn skin is apparent. Melanomas expressing late 
melanocyte markers frequently have a polydendritic morphology similar to adult 
melanocytes, with heavy pigmentation and high levels of tyrosinase activity (Fig. 5 c). 
Melanocyte Differentiation Pathway. From these studies of differentiation antigens on 
melanocytes and melanomas, a surface antigenic map of the melanocyte lineage can 
be proposed (Fig. 6). At least three distinct stages in melanocyte differentiation can 
be defined - precursor, intermediate, and mature. We infer the features of melanocyte 
precursors from the characteristics of melanomas expressing early markers of differ- 
entiation. The intermediate and mature phases of melanocyte development are 
defined by markers that distinguish fetal/newborn melanocytes from adult melano- 
cytes. On the basis of surface antigens, morphology, pigmentation, and tyrosinase 
1764

activity, three classes of melanomas can be identified, corresponding to the features of 
normal melanocytes at the early, intermediate, or mature phases in melanocyte 
differentiation. 
Discussion 
The process of cellular differentiation is accompanied by changes in the surface 
antigenic phenotype, and surface antigens that distinguish cells belonging to distinct 
differentiation lineages or distinguish cells at different phases in the same differentia- 
tion lineage are referred to as differentiation antigens (14). Initial recognition of 
differentiation antigens came about through analysis of surface antigens of T cell 
leukemias of the mouse and the description of the TL (15), Thy-1 (16), and Lyt (17) 
series of antigens. The analysis of these T cell differentiation antigens was greatly 
simplified by the availability of normal T cells from the thymus and from other 
lymphoid organs for a side-by-side comparison with leukemic T cells. Although the 
study of differentiation antigens on T cells and B cells of mouse and man is relatively 
advanced, little is known about differentiation antigens displayed on normal and 
neoplastic cells belonging to other lineages, and this is due to the difficulty of 
obtaining a ready source of the appropriate normal cell type. The recently described 
technique to culture melanocytes from normal skin (6) provides a renewable source of 
proliferating cells for the analysis of melanocyte differentiation antigens, and the 
monoclonal antibodies detecting cell surface antigens of melanoma provide the initial 
serological probes for this analysis. 
On the basis of reactions with melanocytes from fetal, newborn, or adult skin, we 
identified antigens that appear to be early, intermediate, or late markers ofmelanocyte 
differentiation. The late markers, such as M-10, are strongly expressed by adult 
melanocytes. Intermediate melanocyte markers, such as M-4, are found on fetal and 
newborn melanocytes but not adult melanocytes. With regard to antigens detected on 
melanomas but not on fetal, newborn, or adult melanocytes, we propose that these 
are early markers expressed by melanocyte precursors but not by ceils further down 
the melanocyte pathway. Although a melanocyte precursor cell has not as yet been 
identified in the skin, we suggest that its surface phenotype would correspond to the 
M-2 +, M-3 +, HLA-DR + subset of melanomas. One candidate for the melanocyte 
precursor is the indeterminate cell type found in the basal layer of the epidermis (18). 
Because these cells express HLA-DR but do not contain melanosomes or tyrosinase 
activity, they have been considered precursors of Langerhans cells in the upper 
epidermis, but it is equally plausible that some indeterminate cells are precursors of 
melanocytes. Two other explanations for the expression of antigens on melanoma cells 
but not melanocytes should be considered. One possibility is that a second differen- 
tiation pathway for pigment cells exists. A bifurcation could occur in the neural crest 
pathway, with one arm leading to epidermal melanocytes and another arm leading 
to nevus cells. HLA-DR, M-2, and M-3 would be expressed only on nevus cells and 
pigmented tumors derived from them, hut not on normal or malignant melanocytes. 
The other possibility, which we consider less likely, is that these antigens are unrelated 
to neural crest differentiation but are the result of abnormal gene expression induced 
during the process of malignant transformation and tumor progression. 
In addition to the value that these melanocyte differentiation markers have for 
investigating normal melanocytes and their precursors, it seems likely that such 
markers will also provide new ways to analyze and classify melanomas. For instance, 
melanoma cell lines fall into one of three general classes on the basis of expression of 
HOUGHTON, EISINGER, ALBINO, CAIRNCROSS, AND OLD 
1765 
early, intermediate, or late melanocyte antigens. Although the significance of this 
classification awaits the results of comparable studies with noneuhured tissue speci- 
mens, there is an evident correlation between the surface antigenic phenotype of the 
cultured melanoma line and other differentiation characteristics, such as morphology, 
pigmentation, and tyrosinase activity. Melanomas expressing early markers but 
lacking intermediate or late markers have an epithelioid morphology, lack pigmen- 
tation, and have low levels of tyrosinase. In contrast, melanomas expressing late 
markers, such as M-9 and M-10, have a spindle-shaped or polydendritic morphology, 
are pigmented, and have high levels of tyrosinase. Intermediate classes of melanoma 
can be distinguished that express intermediate melanocyte markers, and these gener- 
ally have a spindle morphology, little pigmentation, and low levels of tyrosinase. 
A question that cannot be answered with the available evidence is whether 
melanomas arise at any one of a number of stages throughout the melanocyte lineage 
or whether there is a preferential stage for malignant transformation. The finding 
that the phenotypes of melanoma correspond to distinct phases in the melanocyte 
pathway could be explained by transformation of early, intermediate, or mature 
progenitors, or alternatively, by transformation of early progenitors with transform- 
ants having the ability to undergo variable but characteristic degrees of differentiation 
to later stages of melanocyte differentiation. The overlapping phenotypic character- 
istics of melanoma cell lines from different individuals is consistent with either 
explanation. However, the striking phenotypic variation of different melanoma 
metastases derived from a single patient (19), where individual metastases were found 
to show characteristics of either early or intermediate melanocyte stages, is more 
consistent with a model of early stage transformation and variable capacity of progeny 
cells to differentiate toward later stages. This matter may be clarified by the results of 
current attempts to transform melanocytes from different stages of differentiation 
with chemical or physical carcinogens. 
Summary 
The surface antigens of melanocytes from newborn and adult skin have been 
analyzed with monoclonal antibodies detecting cell surface antigens of malignant 
melanoma. Antigenic markers that distinguish early, intermediate, and mature stages 
in melanocyte differentiation have been defined. The characteristics of the normal 
melanocyte precursor have been inferred from the features of melanomas that express 
early markers of melanocyte differentiation. A rudimentary surface antigen map of 
cells undergoing melanocyte differentiation and a new classification of melanomas 
based on the expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens are proposed.

The Physiology of Vasopressin Release and the Pathogenesis
of Impaired Water Excretion in Adrenal, Thyroid, and
Edematous Disorders

Received September 25, 1980
Osmotic control for vasopressin release has been recognized for several years. Further
understanding of factors affecting the sensitivity and threshold of ADH release has been
advanced by the technological development of a sensitive radioimmunoassay.
Evidence suggesting that ADH secretion is also mediated by nonosmotic stimuli involving a
separate anatomic pathway from the hypothalamic osmoreceptor has been well documented.
Experimental results suggest that the parasympathetic afferent pathways from both ""high"" and
""low"" pressure receptors constitute the most important nonosmotic pathways for ADH release.
Factors such as hypoxia, altered hemodynamic states, alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimuli,
nicotine, adrenal
insufficiency, and advanced
hypothyroidism
are
likely examples which
activate this nonosmotic pathway.
Clarification of the exact interrelationship between the osmotic and nonosmotic release of
ADH needs further examination, particularly in the area of central neurotransmitters. How-
ever, available information allows for the proposal of a model of this interaction and its clinical
implications which may explain many cases of ""reset osmostat.""
Recent available data also provide support for ADH playing a role in the maintenance of
blood pressure under certain circumstances. Like other potent vasoconstrictors, preliminary
evidence suggests that ADH requires transcellular calcium influx for its vascular effects.
Adrenal, thyroid, and edematous disorders have
all been shown to be associated with
abnormal water excretion. The results of recent studies indicate that these abnormal physiologi-
cal states have impaired water excretion as a result of both nonosmolar factors stimulating
ADH release and intrarenal factors, including diminished glomerular filtration rate or increased
proximal tubule reabsorption which lead to decreased distal fluid delivery to the diluting
segment of the nephron.
Verney's original studies demonstrating the osmoreceptor regulation of ADH release remain
a milestone
in renal physiology.
In the past decade, considerable new information about
nonosmotic regulation of ADH has led to further understanding of renal water regulation in
health and disease; nevertheless, many of these answers have only stimulated the imagination to
ponder even more questions.
INTRODUCTION
In the presence of large variations in water intake, the osmotic concentration of
body fluids in a healthy man is maintained within a narrow range between 286 and
294 mOsm/ kg H20. This ability to maintain the body fluids' osmotic concentration
within a normal range
is dependent on the operation of a functioning thirst-

neurohypophyseal-renal feedback system. Osmotic control for vasopressin (ADH)
release from the neurohypophyseal system has been recognized for several years [1].
With the technological advancement of a highly accurate radioimmunoassay for
ADH measurement, further characterization of the sensitivity of this feedback system
has recently been elucidated. Although some evidence existed many years ago that
nonosmotic stimuli also could affect ADH release [1], recent experimentation has
unequivocably demonstrated that ADH secretion is also mediated by nonosmotic
stimuli which are modulated by a separate anatomic pathway from the hypothalamic
osmoreceptor. Clinical studies, as well as sensitive electrophysiological studies, have
been helpful in clarifying the relationship between the osmotic and nonosmotic
pathways for ADH release. Recent experiments are also beginning to explore the
central nervous system neurotransmitters which may mediate the release of ADH.
Finally, the role of ADH in the maintenance of blood pressure and in the pathophy-
siology of impaired water excretion in various disease states is also beginning to be
clarified. The purpose of this paper is to review the current state of the art regarding
the control of ADH release and the role this hormone plays in various pathophysio-
logical conditions.
OSMOTIC CONTROL OF ADH RELEASE
Verney's classical experiments on conscious dogs were the first to demonstrate the
existence of an ""'osmoreceptor"" regulating urine flow [1]. These studies were also the
first to suggest that the ""osmoreceptor"" influences the release of ADH from the
posterior pituitary gland. Subsequent experiemnts have localized the ""osmoreceptor""
to the anterior hypothalamus [2].
Other investigators have suggested a ""sodium receptor"" theory for the release of
ADH [3,4]. Indirect evidence against this hypothesis is that comparable increments in
plasma osmolality during hypertonic saline and hypertonic mannitol infusions
provide the same degree of rise in plasma ADH levels, yet extracellular fluid (ECF)
sodium concentration decreases with hypertonic mannitol [5,6]. More direct evidence
against the ""sodium receptor"" theory is that with infusions of hypertonic saline,
hypertonic sucrose,
or hypertonic urea, sodium concentration increases in the
cerebrospinal fluid, but, as will be discussed later, only hypertonic saline and sucrose
cause an antidiuresis [4,7,8].
Until the recent technological advancement of the measurement of plasma ADH
by radioimmunoassay, little additional knowledge was added to Verney's original
views of secretion and control of ADH. Robertson and his colleagues, with the aide
of a sensitive radioimmunoassay for ADH assay, have been able to support Verney's
observation by showing a close interrelation between plasma osmolality and ADH
levels [9]. The osmotic threshold for ADH release is defined using linear regression
analysis as the point of intercept on the horizontal axis (280 mOsm/kg H20). The
slope of the linear regression line characterizes the sensitivity of the osmoreceptor.
This use of linear regression analysis to define the functional properties of the
osmoreceptor has recently been challenged [10]. However, whether the mathematical
model to define the relationship among the osmoreceptor, plasma ADH, and plasma
osmolality
is linear or exponential makes little functional difference within the
physiological range of plasma osmolality [11].
Robertson and his associates have also demonstrated a significant correlation
between plasma ADH levels and urinary osmolality [12]. Patients with nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus are, of course, the exception to this relationship. Use of the
radioimmunoassay of plasma ADH has confirmed the remarkable sensitivity of the
526
DISORDERS OF WATER METABOLISM
osmoreceptor-ADH-renal reflex. A mere
1 percent increase in total body water can
decrease plasma ADH levels and urine osmolality while a 2 percent increase in total
body water causes maximum suppression of ADH and dilution of urine. In the
opposite direction, maximum urinary concentration and increased ADH secretion
occurs with just a 2 percent decrease in total body water [13].
Several potential factors may affect the initial release of ADH during a rise in
plasma osmolality (Table
1). The osmotic threshold for ADH release may be
influenced by genetic or environmental factors [12,15,16] as well as species variation
[6,9,14,16-18]. Soem evidence suggests that the intracellular solute concentration
may influence the osmotic threshold for ADH release [12,17]. Nonosmotic stimuli
such as hypovolemia or hypotension appear to lower the osmotic threshold of the
system [6,17,19].
Several potential factors affect the sensitivity of the release of ADH (Table 2).
Recent evidence has shown that there is a greater rise in plasma ADH for the same
degree of increase in plasma osmolality in older rather than younger individuals [20].
No detectable differences in osmotic threshold, however, were observed between the
different age groups. Evidence also suggests that the faster the rate of change of
plasma osmolality, the sensitivity of ADH release appears to increase also [6,12]. As
there are individual variations in osmotic threshold, individual variations in the
sensitivity of the osmoreceptor mechanism are also seen [12]. Verney originally
demonstrated, and others have confirmed, that the type of solute utilized to provide
an osmotic stimulus for ADH release must be considered [1,5,6]. Hypertonic saline
and hypertonic mannitol infusions provide the same degree of rise in ADH levels.
Hypertonic urea, however, is a poor osmotic stimulus for ADH secretion. Since
osmoreceptor cells appear to sense cell volume and urea easily penetrates into cells, it
is unable to provide an ""effective"" osmotic stimulus [13]. Pertinent to this area of
discussion
is the hypothesis that the blood-brain barrier
is the semipermeable
membrane for osmoregulation [3]. If this were the case, urea, which does not readily
penetrate the blood-brain barrier, would be a potent stimulus for ADH secretion.
This datum suggests, therefore, that the location of the osmoreceptor is in a portion
of the brain that is anatomically exterior to the blood-brain barrier. The subfornical
organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis meet these anatomical
requirements [3,13].
Results from Athar and Robertson [5,6] show, in contrast to studies from Verney
[1], that in man suppression of ADH release results from the infusion of hypertonic
glucose. This information leads one to speculate that the polyuria associated with
poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may not just be the result of an osmotic diuresis
with glucosuria but also is due to ADH suppression [13]. The mechanism and
confirmation of this proposed suppression of ADH by hyperglycemia remains to be
studied.

In the scientific literature, controversy exists as to the role of angiotensin II
stimulating ADH release [21-24]. A clear dissociation between plasma ADH levels
and renin activity has been demonstrated in man [25]. The reason for the discordant
results may be due to differences in experimental design and methodology [13].
Further experiments are indicated to clarify the controversy in this specific area.
Finally,
there
is the question of whether nonosmotic stimuli can affect the
sensitivity of the osmoreceptor. Studies from the same laboratory and in the same
species have shown different results concerning this subject [17,19]. More data,
therefore, are needed to examine the role of changes in volume status and other
nonosmotic stimuli on the sensitivity of the osmoreceptor [13].
NONOSMOTIC CONTROL OF ADH RELEASE
Verney's original studies were primarily concerned with the role of osmotic control
of ADH
release [1]. These early experiments, however, also revealed that the
production of ""emotional stress"" by electrical stimulation of the flanks of the dogs
resulted in a small and transient antidiuresis. These investigators also noted that, with
the electrical stimulation, simultaneous elevations in blood pressure accompanied the
antidiuresis. Denervation of the adrenals and kidneys bilaterally and sectioning of the
splanchnic nerves were undertaken to eliminate the possibility that sympathetic
stimulation during the ""emotional stress"" was obscuring an even greater antidiuresis.
They postulated an inhibitory effect on ADH release or a diminished end-organ
response by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Indeed, when electrical
stimulation was performed after interruption of these neural pathways, a larger and
more sustained antidiuresis resulted. Further support for a role of the sympathetic
nervous system was obtained since electrical stimulation also failed to produce a
significant antidiuresis when these animals were infused with either norepinephrine
or tyramine. The question still remained as to whether the sympathetic discharge
inhibited ADH release or diminished the end-organ response to ADH. Experiments
performed in water diuresing animals being infused with tyramine and then given
posterior pituitary extract demonstrated an antidiuresis which was comparable to
that observed in control animals not receiving tyramine. This finding suggested a
central, rather than a renal, interaction between ADH and the sympathetic nervous
system. Verney and his associates reasoned that the suppression of ADH release via
the sympathetic nervous system was not secondary to the pressor effects since
bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries increased systemic pressure to the
same degree as infusions of catecholamines yet did not interfere with ADH release
[1].
528
DISORDERS OF WATER METABOLISM
Several years later, however, studies performed by Share and Levy demonstrated
that common carotid artery occlusion by itself without elevation in blood pressure
could produce an antidiuresis [26]. Later, Schrier and Berl performed bilateral
cervical vagotomy and also produced an ADH-dependent antidiuresis, thereby
further stimulating interest about the role of the autonomic nervous system in the
control of renal water excretion [27] (Fig. 1). These investigators also used atropine
to block the efferent limb of the parasympathetic nervous system and this maneuver
did not alter the effect of cervical vagotomy on renal water excretion. These results
therefore implicated afferent vagal pathways in the nonosmotic release of ADH.
The next development in the area of nonosmotic release of ADH involved studies
of the mechanism by which norepinephrine causes a water diuresis. Some in vitro
results had suggested a direct antagonism of norepinephrine on the effect of ADH at
the level of the renal tubule epithelium [28,29]. However, in vivo studies performed in
our laboratory on ADH-free animals receiving a simultaneous constant infusion of
exogenous vasopressin demonstrated that norepinephrine failed to cause a water
diuresis [30-32], thus not supporting the in vitro results [28,29]. These experiments
indicated that intravenous norepinephrine caused a water diuresis by inhibition of
endogenous ADH secretion [33]. Further experiments from our laboratory demon-
strated that norepinephrine did not directly suppress the central release of ADH
secretion but worked through a baroreceptor-mediated mechanism [30] (Fig. 2). In
these experiments
a more significant free water diuresis was achieved during
intravenous as compared to intracarotid infusion of norepinephrine. The diuresis
with intravenous norepinephrine could be abolished by baroreceptor denervation
(bilateral cervical vagotomy and carotid sinus denervation). Since norepinephrine
was shown to inhibit ADH release through a baroreceptor-mediated mechanism and
this inhibitory phenomenon was blocked with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist [34], it
seemed reasonable to examine whether beta-adreneregic agonists stimulate ADH

Isoproterenol
infusion caused
a potent antidiuresis which was ADH-
mediated and, like alpha-adrenergic stimulation, was dependent on the integrity of
baroreceptor pathways [31,35-37].
There
is evidence accumulating which suggests that the primary nonosmotic
pathway for regulation of ADH release involves baroreceptor pathways [38,39].
Entirely different stimuli such as exogenous catecholamines [30-37], acute constric-
tion of the thoracic vena cava [40] (Fig. 3), acute hemorrhage [41], hypoxia [42], left
atrial distension [43], atrial tachycardia [44], and nicotine [45] are all dependent on
the integrity of the baroreceptors for their effect on ADH release. The nicotine and
hypoxia stimuli are interesting in that both of these stimulate ADH secretion via a
baroreceptor-mediated mechanism without producing hypotension [42,45]. Hence, it
appears that increased sympathetic stimulation, even in the absence of a fall in
arterial pressure, will activate the baroreceptor pathway for the nonosmotic release of
ADH.
Some controversy has arisen concerning the role of low pressure (left atrial)
baroreceptors in modulating the nonosmotic release of ADH [41,46]. Utilizing
bioassay measurements of plasma ADH, the results of some studies suggest that
suppression of ADH does not mediate the diuresis associated with left atrial
distension while other experiments provide contrary results [47,48]. de Torrente et al.
have recently found, in animals without an endogenous source of ADH release, that
with infusion of exogenous ADH left atrial distension did not cause a diuresis [43].
Left atrial distension in intact animals also was associated with a reversible decrease

in radioimmunoassayable titers of ADH (Fig. 4). Suppression of ADH via vagal
pathways has also been shown to be important in pacemaker-induced atrial tachy-
cardia associated with elevated left atrium pressure [44]. Recently, Bennett and
Yaron have produced an antidiuresis associated with an elevated plasma ADH titer
measured by radioimmunoassay
in a model of pulmonary hypertension which
decreases left atrial pressures [49]. Taken together, these experimental results indicate
that low, as well as high, pressure baroreceptors are important in modulating the
nonosmotic release of ADH.
Other pathways for stimulation of ADH release have been suggested. These
include a cerebral pain center [50], chemoreceptors [51], and a cerebral emetic center
[52]. However, no experimental data in support of these proposed pathways has yet
been demonstrated [13,42]. It is conceivable that any effect of pain and nausea on
ADH release may be mediated through baroreceptor pathways [13], since these
events are no doubt associated with altered autonomic neural tone. Figure 5 is a

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OSMOTIC AND NONOSMOTIC
PATHWAYS FOR ADH RELEASE
Some understanding of the interaction between the osmotic and nonosmotic
pathways for ADH release has recently been obtained. Some of this knowledge has
accrued from the study of patients who have been classified as having ""essential
hypernatremia"" [53]. These patients appear to have an intact pathway for nonos-
motic release of ADH but lack an osmoreceptor-mediated pathway. Adipsia is
present in these patients, thus indicating ablation of the thirst center. Hypothalamic
lesions have been demonstrated in most cases. One can reasonably conclude from this
information that the sites of the osmoreceptor and thirst center are located in close
proximity in the hypothalamus, both of which must be anatomically separate from
the baroreceptor pathways for the nonosmotic control of ADH. The magnocellular
nuclei
in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei must also be anatomically
separate from the osmoreceptor cells, since ADH synthesis and release was normal in
response to a nonosmotic stimulus, i.e., drug-induced hypotension.
Further insight into the interaction between the osmotic and nonosmotic pathways
has been obtained from electrophysiological data [54]. Studies performed by Kannan
and Yagi [54] on supraoptic neurons in rats have demonstrated that both nonosmotic
and osmotic stimuli can evoke electrical activity, which correlates with ADH release,
from the same supraoptic neuron. From the information gleaned from this study and
that of patients with ""essential hypernatremia""
the following model has been
proposed (Fig. 6). The same supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei receive inputs
from anatomically separate osmotic and nonosmotic pathways [13]. Knowledge of
this relationship may explain many cases of ""reset osmostat"" in which competitive
osmotic and nonosmotic input occurs. Specifically, the presence of a persistent
nonosmotic stimulus for vasopressin may cause water retention until the hypo-
osmolality is of a sufficient degree that the osmoreceptor pathway then predominates

and vasopressin release is then suppressed. On the other hand, some nonosmotic
stimuli are so potent that the hypo-osmolality is not sufficient to suppress vasopressin
release. The former situation has been termed ""reset osmostat"" and the latter
situation the ""syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion."" In fact,
both of these clinical circumstances may fall within the same spectrum in which the
ultimate balance between opposing osmotic and nonosmotic stimuli dictates the level
of plasma osmolality rather than any intrinsic ""resetting"" of the hypothalamic
osmoreceptors.
The details of central neurotransmission for ADH release have not been well
delineated. Currently, important roles have been claimed for cyclic nucleotides [13],
catecholamines [3,55,56], calcium [57,58], and acetylcholine [3,55,59]. Miller et al.
have shown that catecholamines may have an in vivo role as potential neurotransmit-
ters in the release of ADH [56]. Rats with depleted brain catecholamines secondary
to intraventricular 6-OH dopamine injection had decreased responses in urine
osmolality and smaller rises in radioimmunoassayable titers of ADH with both
osmotic and nonosmotic stimuli (Figs. 7 and 8). This study did not differentiate
between a role for norepinephrine versus dopamine in this neurotransmission of
ADH, and thus further studies are needed in this area. Since catecholamines have
been found in some tissues to enhance calcium movement into cells [60], it is quite
provocative that Handelman et al. have recently implicated cellular calcium influx in
the nonosmotic release of ADH in vivo [58]. In this study, two different inhibitors of
cellular influx were shown to blunt the nonosmotic release of ADH.
VASCULAR EFFECTS OF ADH
The knowledge that ADH or vasopressin has vasoconstrictor properties when
given in large doses has been known for many years. Very recent data suggests that,
like catecholamines and angiotensin II, ADH induces vasoconstriction in vivo by
enhancing transcellular calcium influx [61]. The recent availability of an agent, 1-
deamino penicillamine, 2-(0-methyl) tyrosine vasopressin, which specifically antag-
onizes the vascular effects of ADH, supports the role of an endogenous vascular

effect of ADH [62]. When the ADH vascular inhibitor was used in water diuresing
rats with undetectable ADH levels, blood pressure did not fall and ADH levels were
undetectable. However, in fluid deprived rats that were shown to have elevated ADH
plasma levels of approximately 20 pg/ ml, blood pressure significantly declined in the
presence of this vascular inhibitor of ADH. This study [63], therefore, supports a role
for endogenous ADH contributing to the maintenance of blood pressure in fluid
deprived states in the rat.
ABNORMAL WATER EXCRETION IN EDEMATOUS,
ADRENAL, AND THYROID DISEASE
A wide variety of clinical disorders are commonly associated with hyponatremia
secondary to a defect in water regulation [65] (Fig. 9). Regulatory factors which may
influence normal renal dilution include: glomerular filtration rate, renal solute
excretion, tubular fluid delivery to the distal nephron, ADH release, ADH-induced
water permeability of the collecting duct, papillary tissue solute concentration, and
proper functioning of the distal nephron [65]. The understanding of the pathogenesis
of impaired water excretion associated with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency,
and edematous disorders has been an area of interest for many years [66,67]. Current
concepts on the pathogenesis of the renal dilution defect associated with these
disorders will be the primary focus of the remainder of this paper.

EDEMATOUS DISORDERS:
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND CIRRHOSIS
Cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure are commonly associated with
water and sodium retention.
In both of these disorders, decreased glomerular
filtration rate, increased proximal tubular fluid reabsorption, and elevated plasma
ADH levels have all been proposed as possible mechanisms for diminished renal
water excretion [67]. A decrease in ""effective circulating blood volume"" is believed to
be the precipitating factor which may activate both the intrarenal (decreased
glomerular filtration rate and increased proximal fluid reabsorption) and extrarenal
(increased ADH) mechanisms which restrict water excretion [67].
Congestive Heart Failure
Bennett et al. have demonstrated decreased distal delivery of tubular fluid in
patients with congestive heart failure [68]. Several animal models of congestive heart
failure have also demonstrated increased proximal tubule reabsorption of tubular
fluid [40,69]. Studies performed by Anderson and associates [40], however, support a
mechanism for acute water retention in experimental low output failure that is
predominantly mediated by decreased afferent parasympathetic tone from barore-
ceptors, which results in ADH release. As previously mentioned, Yaron and Bennett
also produced an ADH dependent antidiuresis in conscious dogs with acute pulmon-
ary hypertension and right ventricular failure [49]. Recent studies utilizing the
radioimmunoassay for ADH have also shown, in patients with congestive heart
failure, persistently elevated levels of ADH in spite of hypoosmolality and marked
535
SCHRIER AND GOLDBERG
hyponatremia that would normally suppress ADH release in normal subjects [70].
Conscious rats with high output failure from an aorta-caval fistula demonstrated an
inability to excrete a water load while water excretion was normal in ADH-free
Brattleboro rats with the same degree of high output failure [69]. Present clinical and
experimental evidence therefore suggests that both intrarenal factors and persistent
ADH release contribute to the abnormal water excretion commonly seen in heart
failure [66].
Cirrhosis
An impaired ability to excrete a water load occurs in a significant number of
patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver [71,72]. Improvement in water excretion
occurs with maneuvers that expand extracellular fluid volume which has been shown
also to improve renal hemodynamics and distal nephron delivery [72]. However, it is
also a possibility that expansion of the extracellular fluid space may also suppress
baroreceptor-mediated nonosmotic release of ADH [13,66].
A decrease in free water clearance and an increase in urinary osmolality has been
shown to occur with acute portal vein constriction in the dog [73]. Following acute
hypophysectomy, portal vein constriction produced less of a diminution in free water
clearance and urinary osmolality failed to increase. These studies consequently
incriminate both intrarenal and extrarenal (ADH) mechanisms for impaired water
excretion. Similar results have been shown in animal models of chronic liver disease
produced by carbon tetrachloride (CC 14) [74] or chronic bile duct ligation [75]. In the
CC 14 rat model, elevated serum ADH levels were still detected following a water load
despite hypoosmolality. The defect in water excretion could not be detected in ADH-
free Brattleboro rats with CC 14-induced cirrhosis. Therefore, as seen with congestive
heart failure, there is evidence that suggests a dominant role for nonosmolar-induced
ADH
release causing abnormal water excretion in chronic liver disease [66];
however, intrarenal factors may also contribute.
HYPOTHYROIDISM
Impairment of water excretion and hyponatremia has been described in patients
[76] and animals [77] with hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone replacement has been
shown to significantly improve this dilution abnormality [77]. Diminished renal
blood flow and glomerular filtration have been noted in the hypothyroid state,
suggesting important intrarenal mechanisms for the dilutional defect [66,76]. In the
myxedematous patient the most likely etiology of the renal hypoperfusion and
augmented proximal tubule reabsorption is the decreased systemic hemodynamics
which has been observed [66]. In hypothyroid patients receiving an oral water load a
modest increase in minimum urinary osmolality occurs associated with a marked
limitation in urine flow rate [76]. TIhese findings are most consistent with intrarenal
factors having a dominant role in altered water excretion in hypothyroidism [66].
Studies, however, using radioimmunoassay measurements of ADH and ADH-free
Brattleboro rats also support the contention that vasopressin-independent renal
factors limit water excretion in hypothyroid states [66,76]. However, Skowsky's
studies also revealed that in some patients, despite hypoosmolality, there were
elevated levels of ADH, thus implicating enhanced vasopressin secretion in at least
some patients with hypothyroidism [76]. Other studies in rats [78] and sheep [79] also
indicate a role of ADH in the impaired water excretion associated with hypothyroid-
ism. Decreased cardiac output in advanced hypothyroidism with activation of the
baroreceptors is the most likely explanation for this enhanced ADH secretion. The
536
DISORDERS OF WATER METABOLISM
relative roles of ADH and intrarenal factors apparently depend therefore on the
severity of the hypothyroid state. Mild hypothyroidism causes diminished water
excretion predominantly secondary to intrarenal factors while ADH release also
becomes involved in more severe hypothyroidism.
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY
Adrenal insufficiency is another pathological state associated with a dilutional
defect. It appears that separate roles have been defined for mineralocorticoid and
glucocorticoid deficiencies [67].
Mineralocorticoid Deficiency
Early studies by Kleeman and associates corrected the abnormal water excretion in
primary adrenal
insufficiency with the administration
of glucocorticoids
[80].
Unfortunately, pharmacological doses of steroids were used which could have
conceivably occupied mineralocorticoid receptors and thereby corrected the altered
water excretion [66]. In this regard, other investigators replaced the extracellular
fluid volume, but not glucocorticoid hormone, in Addisonian patients and demon-
strated improvement in the ability to excrete a dilute urine [81].
With the aid of bioassay measurements of ADH, Share and Travis [82] were able
to show that either volume expansion with sodium chloride supplements or glucocor-
ticoid replacement could inhibit ADH secretion in dogs with adrenal insufficiency.
Ufferman et al. studied conscious adrenalectomized dogs replaced with physiological
doses of glucocorticoids [83]. These animals were shown to have an impaired
response to a water load and develop hyponatremia. This hyponatremia was
associated with extracellular fluid volume depletion. Either saline drinking water or
chronic mineralocorticoid replacement in physiological doses corrected the defect in
water excretion. Radioimmunoassay levels of ADH in similar animals demonstrated
elevated titers in spite of a hypoosmolar state [84]. The persistent elevation of plasma
ADH was no doubt secondary to the known nonosmotic stimulus of ECF volume
depletion.
As in the previous pathological conditions discussed, intrarenal mechanisms have
also been implicated in the water excretion defect seen in isolated mineralocorticoid
deficient animals. ADH-free Brattleboro rats display a defect in water excretion that
is corrected by mineralocorticoid replacement or normalization of the extracellular
fluid volume [85].
Glucocorticoid Hormone Deficiency
Isolated glucocorticoid deficient states also have been shown to have impaired
water excretion [67,86]. As with the previous pathological conditions discussed both
intrarenal and extrarenal factors have been determined to play major roles in the
altered dilution process [87,88].
Elevated plasma ADH levels measured by radioimmunoassay have been shown in
both glucocorticoid deficient
rats [88,89] and dogs [90] with abnormal water
excretion (Fig. 10). A decrease in cardiac function has been seen in both glucocorti-
coid deficient rats and dogs and is the most likely stimulus for the nonosmotic release
of ADH [88,90]. The pathogenesis for the altered cardiac function is currently not
understood, but has been clearly dissociated from extracellular volume depletion. In
this regard, there is evidence that glucocorticoid deficiency directly impairs myocar-
dial function [88,90].
Studies in Brattleboro rats with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus have

also provided
evidence
for ADH independent mechanisms of impaired water
excretion with glucocorticoid deficiency [85,88]. Both Linas and associates [88] and
Green et al. [85] have shown that with prolonged glucocorticoid deficiency intrarenal
factors impair water excretion. This effect is probably secondary to marked decreases
in both systemic and renal hemodynamics [88,90].
It has been suggested that deficiency of glucocorticoid hormones increases water
permeability of the distal nephron [80,91]. Using an isolated perfused renal papilla
preparation, Rayson et al. [92] have provided direct evidence against this postulate.
Moreover,
in anuran membranes glucocorticoid hormone enhances, rather than
diminishes, osmotic water movement [93]. The evidence of increased papillary 3',5'-
adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in papillas from adrenalectomized rats
might suggest a direct effect of glucocorticoid deficiency on collecting duct water
permeability. However, the observation that this effect on papillary cyclic AMP
could be abolished by in vivo but not in vitro ADH administration is compatible with
an effect of glucocorticoid deficiency which is mediated by persistent release of ADH.

ABSTRACT-i-Despite advances in biochemical assess- 
ment and imaging, phaeochromocytoma remains a dif- 
ficult diagnosis. Using the names of patients whose 
death certificate listed phaeochromocytoma as a cause 
of death, a retrospective survey of 62 deaths from 
phaeochromocytoma (48 benign, 14 malignant) was 
carried out. All deaths occurred between 1981 and 
1989, so the pitfalls uncovered reflect recent practice. A 
substantial proportion presented with abdominal pain 
and vomiting, dyspnoea, left ventricular failure or 
hypotension rather than the classical symptoms. These 
presentations were more common in this autopsy series 
than in prospective series of consecutive patients. Diag- 
nosis in the presence of classical symptoms was often 
delayed but, once it was made, elective excision was 
relatively safe. A personal or family history of symptoms 
suggesting inherited diseases associated with 
phaeochromocytoma was not always given due weight. 
Biochemical tests, particularly 24 hour urinary vanillyl 
mandelic acid, often gave contradictory results; the 
limits of their predictive power should be better appre- 
ciated. Anaesthesia and surgery in the presence of un- 
diagnosed phaeochromocytoma was the cause of death 
in 16 of 62 cases. Recommendations to improve the 
accuracy of diagnosis are made, 
i 
Phaeochromocytoma is a catecholamine secreting 
tumour present in 0.1-1% of patients with arterial 
hypertension [1,2]. In 90% of cases the tumour is 
benign yet deaths still occur because of its rarity as a 
cause of hypertension, intermittent or absent symp- 
toms, lack of specific signs, the limitations of diagnos- 
tic tests and the hazards of anaesthesia and surgery. 
We undertook this survey of patients who had died 
from phaeochromocytoma to investigate the influence 
of these factors. 
Methods 
The names of patients who had an adrenal diagnosis 
recorded on their death certificates were obtained 
from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys of 
the United Kingdom. Of these, 127 listed phaeochro- 
mocytoma as a cause of death. We obtained the case 
notes of 67 of them but in six the documentation was 
insufficient to verify the diagnosis. All the remaining 
61 died between 1982 and 1986; we added a 62nd case 
known to us from 1989. From the case notes we 
extracted data on the onset, duration and develop- 
ment of symptoms and signs, family history, investiga- 
tions performed, operative data and post-mortem 
findings. 
Results 
Prevalence 
There were 40 women and 22 men, a female prepon- 
derance of 1.8:1. The age at death ranged from 13 to 
85 years with a median of 56 (Fig 1). Age at presenta- 
tion was 13 to 85 years with a median of 52 years. The 
median time interval between presentation to a physi- 
cian and death was 19 days (range 15 minutes to 34 
years). The diagnosis was made prior to death in 17 
patients (27%) and after death in 45 (73%); it was 
unsuspected at the time of death in 31 patients (50%). 
In a further 14 patients (23%) the diagnosis was 
suspected but not confirmed. 
Four benign phaeochromocytomas were diagnosed 
ante-mortem; two died within hours of elective 
removal. The third collapsed with occipital headaches 
and weakness of arms and legs after seven years of typi- 
cal symptoms; he had labile hypertension and epigas- 
tric pain due to pancreatitis and a serum CPK of 
13,000 IU/1 suggesting rhabdomyolysis. He died in 
renal failure seven days later. The fourth, aged 68, 
died of chronic renal failure and left ventricular fail- 
ure (LVF) which were present before and after 
removal of a phaeochromocytoma 21 months earlier. 
Malignant phaeochromocytoma was present in 14 
patients (23%); thirteen of these were diagnosed ante- 
mortem. The 14th patient was a teenager with neuro- 
fibromatosis who presented with a right hypochondrial 
mass and metastatic disease. 
Symptoms and signs 
Typical symptoms of phaeochromocytoma were pre- 
sent for over three months prior to death in 38 
patients (61%), 25 benign and 13 malignant; the most 
common were palpitations in 20, episodic sweating in 
19, dyspnoea in 15 and headaches in 14 (Fig 2). Symp- 
toms were present for less than three months in 18 
patients (29%), 17 benign and one malignant, and 
hypertension alone for over three months was present 
in six (10%). Most of the symptoms occurred with

both benign and malignant tumours but bone pain, 
anorexia and paraplegia occurred exclusively, and 
weight loss predominantly, with malignant tumours. 
Episodic symptoms were often nocturnal. 
The pattern of symptoms was different in the 18 
with a duration of less than three months (Fig 3). Six- 
teen suffered from abdominal pain and all 18 from 
vomiting. The pain was usually suggestive of an acute 
abdominal crisis and localised over the site of the 
tumour. In three cases it was caused by acute pancre- 
atitis (serum amylase 1675, 2110 and 4310 Somogyi 
units). Dyspnoea, mostly from LVF, was present in 15, 
chest pain in 11, sweating in 9 and headaches in 4. 
The physical signs during the final illness are shown 
in Fig 4. Hypertension was present in 45 (73%) but six 
(10%) were hypotensive. Ten patients under 50 had 
had hypertension for more than six months; of the 
four with benign tumours, three were undiagnosed. 
Signs of heart failure were present in 33 (53%) and a 
further 13 (21%) had tachycardia in the absence of 
heart failure. Retinopathy was recorded in 13 (21%) 
and pyrexia in 18 (29%). Abdominal tenderness was 
present in 10 (16%) and an abdominal mass was felt in 
8 (13%). Pupils were dilated and reacted sluggishly to 
light in 11 (18%). 
Family history 
Three patients had a significant family history and 
another had neurofibromatosis without a family his- 
tory. One patient had a strong family history of multi- 
ple endocrine adenomatosis type II, with mother and 
five maternal relatives having medullary carcinoma of 
the thyroid and/or bilateral phaeochromocytomas. 
There was a four year history of episodic palpitations, 
headaches, sweating and pallor, particularly at night, 
after exercise or alcohol. On two occasions 24 hour 
urinary vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) excretion was 
normal. The patient woke one morning with palpita- 
tions, agitation, abdominal pain and haematemesis 
and had a cardiac arrest in the ambulance. Autopsy 
showed a haemorrhagic tumour with retroperitoneal 
haemorrhage. 
Two patients had both family history and stigmata of 
neurofibromatosis. One teenager presented with a 
right hypochondrial mass with lung and liver meta- 
stases. He had been hypertensive for more than three 
months but one VMA measurement was normal so 
surgery was performed without alpha and beta block- 
ade. He had a cardiac arrest as the tumour was 
mobilised during diagnostic laparotomy and died 
three days later. The second patient had a one year his- 
tory of headaches, palpitations, hot flushes and hyper- 
tension treated with prazosin and metoprolol. Follow- 
ing an elective hysterectomy she developed 
hypertension and tachycardia and died 24 hours after 
surgery. The patient with neurofibromatosis and no 
family history is described under 'Surgery and 
anaesthesia'. 
Investigations 
Urinalysis was reported in the case notes of 27 
patients; it was normal in 12 (44%) and showed pro- 
teinuria in 15 with haematuria in 8. Renal function was 
recorded in 50 patients; serum urea was > 9.0 mmol/1 
and/or creatinine >130 pmol/1 in 31. Glycosuria was 
present in 9 of the cases in which it was recorded. 
Blood glucose was measured in 42 patients and was 
greater than 11 mmol/1, confirming diabetes, in 24 
(57%). One diabetic patient had a normal glucose 
tolerance test after excision of a phaeochromocytoma

Death from phaeochromocytoma 
but VMA excretion remained elevated; recurrence of 
diabetes led to the recognition of metastases from her 
malignant phaeochromocytoma. 
VMA was measured in 24-hour urine collections 
from 22 patients (10 with malignant and 12 with 
benign tumours). Some had only one collection. The 
results were always high in 14 (64% of those tested; 7 
malignant), occasionally high in 3 (14%; 2 malignant) 
and normal in 5 (23%; one malignant). Urinary 
metanephrines were elevated in all four patients 
tested, urinary catecholamines in 10 of the 11 and 
plasma catecholamines in 9 of 12. One patient had 
stimulation tests with glucagon and tyramine, both 
normal. One pentolinium test was positive; no 
clonidine suppression tests were performed. 
A raised leucocyte count was present in 29 of the 
patients and a low haemoglobin in 6. One patient had 
a haemoglobin of 24 g/dl, possibly due in part to 
extracellular fluid depletion. The serum calcitonin was 
elevated in two patients, neither of whom had 
medullary carcinoma of the thyroid at autopsy. 
The electrocardiogram was normal in 8 of 43

patients and showed left ventricular hypertrophy by 
voltage criteria in 9, sinus tachycardia in 18, ischaemic 
changes in 5, myocardial infarction in 2, right bundle 
branch block in 2, left bundle branch block in 2, left 
axis deviation in 2 and atrial fibrillation in 2. Chest 
radiographs from 47 patients were normal in 15 and 
showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio in 8, pul- 
monary oedema in 5, pulmonary metastases in 5 and 
various abnormalities in 9. One patient with hyper- 
tension and LVF from an unrecognised phaeochromo- 
cytoma died following an intravenous urogram with 
niopam contrast medium. Another had a cardiac 
arrest during angiography. A third underwent arteri- 
ography without mishap but the procedure failed to 
locate the tumour. Renal vein sampling for cate- 
cholamines in three patients localised the tumour in 
two. Abdominal ultrasound was performed in 18 
patients; the phaeochromocytoma was shown in 10 
(55% sensitivity), 3 were reported normal and 5 
showed other abnormalities: two 'masses' which were 
not present, two gallbladders containing stones and 
one enlarged liver. A CT scan was performed in 10 
and showed the adrenal phaeochromocytoma in all. A 
diagnostic 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan 
was performed in four patients and located the 
tumour in all. 
Surgery and anaesthesia 
Sixteen patients had an operation in the week prior to 
death; nine of these were for elective surgery in 
patients not known to have a phaeochromocytoma: 
hysterectomy 2, repair of vaginal prolapse 2, tubal 
ligation 1, cholecystectomy 2, abdomino-perineal 
resection 1, and nephroureterectomy for transitional 
cell carcinoma (opposite side to phaeochromocytoma) 
1. Of these nine patients, five had symptoms typical of 
phaeochromocytoma before operation. Three had 
uncontrolled hypertension pre-operatively (diastolic 
pressure >100 mm Hg), two had controlled hyper- 
tension and four were normotensive. Only one patient 
had no symptoms or hypertension pre-operatively. Two 
patients died during elective removal of a phaeo- 
chromocytoma. One, who had an ACTH secreting 
phaeochromocytoma, despite adequate glucocorticoid 
administration and adequate volume replacement 
became hypotensive and oliguric post-operatively. The 
second, a patient with neurofibromatosis, was impec- 
cably investigated pre-operatively but was not sent to 
an ITU after operation. Hypoxia and hypotension 
developed during the night after surgery and the 
patient was found dead on the ward. A teenager with 
an unrecognised malignant phaeochromocytoma died 
during surgery as described under 'Family history'. 
The other four patients had emergency surgery. 
They were all critically ill pre-operatively. One had a 
ruptured spleen from a splenic metastasis. Another 
had a perforation at the recto-sigmoid junction 
secondary to the intractable constipation of malignant 
phaeochromocytoma [3]. A third presented three 
months post-partum with sudden onset of headache, 
upper abdominal pain, vomiting and diabetes; later 
that day she had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. 
Two days later she lost the pulses in her left leg, had 
an unsuccessful embolectomy followed by amputation 
and died of disseminated intravascular coagulation 
and acute renal failure. The fourth patient, aged 55, 
had sudden onset of epigastric pain and vomiting, a 
large left hypochondrial mass, a serum amylase of 
4310 Somogyi units, a large left retroperitoneal haem- 
orrhage at laparotomy and died of acute renal failure. 
Autopsy showed a haemorrhagic and necrotic 
phaeochromocytoma. 
Two patients died more than a week after surgery 
for malignant phaeochromocytoma: one at nine days 
from acute renal and hepatic failure after radical 
surgery and the other seven months after a peri- 
operative stroke.

Death from phaeochromocytoma 
Malignant phaeochromocytoma 
Fourteen patients in this series had malignant 
phaeochromocytoma, all but one with metastases at 
presentation. Three had a palpable abdominal mass. 
Two had features of spinal cord compression; one pre- 
sented with paraplegia and metastases 20 years after 
removal of a paraganglionic tumour and survived a 
further 14 years; the other presented with cord com- 
pression from an extradural tumour and a year of 
hypertension, episodic headache and sweating. Seven 
had their phaeochromocytoma removed, two had 
chemotherapy, two metatyrosine, two radiotherapy, 
three therapeutic MIBG and two had no treatment. 
Median survival was 528 days (range 10 days to 34 
years). 
Autopsy findings 
The phaeochromocytoma was in the right adrenal in 
26 (42%), left adrenal in 24 (39%), both adrenals in 2, 
extra-adrenal sites in 3 and disseminated and of uncer- 
tain origin in 1; the position was not recorded in 6. 
The full autopsy findings were recorded in 45 patients; 
25 had left ventricular hypertrophy and 37 had pul- 
monary oedema. Cystic haemorrhagic change in the 
tumorous adrenal was seen in patients with and 
without pain. 
Discussion 
The mortality rate for phaeochromocytoma in the UK 
based on death certification 1982-6 was approximately 
0.5 per million person years. A survey of incidence in 
Queensland [4] gave a figure of 1.55 and in Sweden 
3.0 [5], In Rochester, Minnesota (with a small popula- 
tion), eight phaeochromocytomas per million person 
years were seen [6]. A significant proportion of 
phaeochromocytomas are diagnosed only at autopsy, 
so a high autopsy rate is necessary to estimate reliably 
the number undiagnosed in life. In our series 50% 
were unsuspected in life, and in a further 23% the 
diagnosis was suspected but not finally confirmed. In 
other series in which full ascertainment was attempted, 
in Queensland (1970-83) 17 of 46 undiagnosed [4], in 
New York (1926-76) 30 of 100 [7], in Detroit 
(1951-82) 11 of 32 [8] and in Nashville (1950-83) 11 
of 69 [9]. In the UK the autopsy rate is low, and often 
performed only if death was unexpected. Thus, our 
series is likely to have a bias, with undiagnosed cases 
over-represented. A more direct comparison may be 
made between our data and the Mayo Clinic autopsy 
series, where 41 of 54 (76%) cases (1928-77) were 
unsuspected clinically [10] and the Swedish Cancer 
Registry (1958-81) which showed that of 439 cases 
40% were diagnosed at autopsy [5]. 
In the current series, 48 of the 62 patients had 
benign tumours (77%), but only 4 of these 48 were 
diagnosed ante-mortem. Failure to make the diagnosis 
of phaeochromocytoma in life was therefore the main 
cause of death in the benign cases, and the paucity of 
deaths in association with elective removal of benign 
tumours suggests that the mortality for benign 
phaeochromocytoma is very low once the condition 
has been diagnosed. Low operative mortality is now 
the rule. Deoreo et al (46 cases, 1952-73) and 
Desmonts et al (102 cases, 1964-76) both reported 
zero operative mortality [11,12]. Melicow had one 
death in 30 operations (1962-76) [7], and Scott and 
Halter 1 in 58 (1950-83) [9]. The value of fluid 
replacement at the time of surgery is emphasised in 
these series. 
Twenty five of the 48 benign cases had typical symp- 
toms of phaeochromocytoma, present for longer than 
3 months. Palpitation, sweating, dyspnoea, headache 
and dizziness were the most common. Other series 
show a similar distribution of symptoms [13]. Of the 
25 cases with typical symptoms, 9 were on antihyper- 
tensive treatment, indicating that they had been under 
medical supervision for their blood pressure. Ten 
exhibited hypertension under the age of 50, of whom 
3 had undiagnosed benign disease. Thus, failure ade- 
quately to investigate young hypertensives is a con- 
tributing factor in some cases. However, we found a 
significant difference in the pattern of symptoms 
exhibited by those patients with symptoms of short 
duration. A high proportion presented with abdomi- 
nal pain and vomiting or dyspnoea, left ventricular 
failure and hypotension. In prospective series, the 
prevalence of abdominal pain is much lower [13,14] 
but was 20% in the Mayo Clinic autopsy series [10], in 
which 5 of 54 had an abdominal mass. Krane also 
reports that an abdominal mass was present in 6 of 11 
cases where the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma was 
unsuspected in life [8]. Thus, patients who present 
with abdominal pain or a mass seem less likely to have 
the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma made in life, 
and are over-represented in autopsy series. Both 
benign and malignant phaeochromocytoma can 
present as acute abdominal crisis. The autopsy results 
lend support to the supposition that this is the result 
of tumour haemorrhage and infarction. Primhak et al 
[15] described a boy who was kicked in the abdomen 
in a football match, developed pain at the site of 
trauma accompanied by a catecholamine crisis and 
died soon after. At autopsy there was retroperitoneal 
bleeding from a large tumour. Phaeochromocytoma 
presenting with heart failure is also likely to be diag- 
nosed only at autopsy [16]. Modlin et al found symp- 
toms to be present for less than 1 year in 12 of their 14 
undiagnosed cases [14]. Myocardial infarction and 
heart failure were the cause of death in half of these. 
Clearly, the early diagnosis of such patients with a 
short history of abdominal or cardiological symptoms 
is very difficult. 
Of the 23% in whom the diagnosis was suspected 
but not confirmed until after death, the reasons were 
multiple. The most common reason was that the

patient died within a short period of the diagnosis 
being suspected and the collections were not com- 
pleted or the samples not yet assayed at the laboratory. 
In other patients, initial clinical suspicion was discount- 
ed by false negative biochemical or radiological results. 
The current series includes patients whose symp- 
toms were nocturnal, related to position or alcohol 
consumption. Constipation was also a feature of these 
cases and seems likely to be due to an adynamic intes- 
tine induced by catecholamine excess. Dilated pupils 
were reported in 18% of the cases reviewed here, a 
sign which has been reported before and is likely to be 
due to sympathomimetic stimulation of the pupillary 
dilator muscle [17]. Acute pancreatitis occurred in 
three cases and rhabdomyolysis and renal failure 
occurred in one of these. Elsewhere this phenomenon 
has been suggested to be due to catecholamine 
induced skeletal muscle ischaemia [18]. Van Heerden 
et al reported one case of pancreatitis in a patient with 
phaeochromocytoma [1]. 
The urinary VMA excretion was the most commonly 
used screening test, being clearly positive in 64% of 
patients and falsely negative in 36%. There was no 
apparent difference in its sensitivity in benign and 
malignant cases. Impaired renal function may have 
influenced the results in some of our cases. However, 
Bravo and Gifford found raised VMA excretion in only 
18 of 43 patients (42% sensitivity) [19]; they collected 
samples from hospitalised patients and used patients 
with essential hypertension as controls. Urinary 
metanephrines were raised in 34 (79% sensitivity). 
These authors found plasma catecholamine measure- 
ment (94% sensitivity) to be the best discriminant 
between phaeochromocytoma and essential hyperten- 
sion. Compiling data from nine earlier series, Manu 
and Runge concluded that metanephrine estimation 
correctly identified 96% of phaeochromocytoma 
patients whereas VMA only identified 84% [20]. In our 
series metanephrine and urinary and plasma cate- 
cholamine measurements all proved more sensitive 
than VMA but the numbers of patients who had these 
tests performed were relatively small. Radiological 
studies were also misleading?ultrasound showing 
phaeochromocytoma in 10 of 18, a 55% sensitivity. Pre- 
sent day ultrasonography may be more sensitive. In the 
few who had computed tomography scans, the tumour 
was localised in 100%. Prior to CT, arteriography and 
intravenous urography were sometimes used. This 
series gives examples of the poor sensitivity of these 
techniques, and the risks of contrast media in 
phaeochromocytoma patients. 
The high proportion of malignant phaeochromo- 
cytomas (23%) reflects the manner of patient 
selection by post-mortem diagnosis. In series of 
consecutive patients, the prevalence of malignancy 
ranged from 6% to 13% [4,7,13,14,21]. It is generally 
accepted that histology alone is a poor guide to malig- 
nant potential and that malignant phaeochromo- 
cytoma is only proven by the presence of metastases. 
Extended follow-up may increase the proportion even- 
tually considered malignant [9]. Survival with malig- 
nant phaeochromocytoma is very variable. Aggressive 
malignancies may be treated with combination 
chemotherapy [22]. 
It is not a practical proposition to screen all hyper- 
tensive patients; selection is essential [23]. Symptoms 
are an important guide, and are well described in 
detail elsewhere [13,24]. A scoring system has been 
devised to aid prediction [25]. The majority of 
patients have intermittent paroxysms lasting less than 
one hour, tending to become more frequent with 
time. Sustained hypertension occurs in 50-60% often 
with superadded paroxysmal elevations. Postural 
hypotension may be a feature. Recently, 24 hour 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has been used 
to identify intermittent elevation of blood pressure, 
which may be nocturnal [26]. Screening should be 
undertaken in those with accelerated or progressive 
hypertension, hypertension occurring at a young age 
or not responding to conventional treatment, a para- 
doxical rise in blood pressure on administration of a 
beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, and those with 
pressor responses to induction of anaesthesia, intra- 
venous contrast media or labour. A family history of 
multiple endocrine adenomatosis type II or neuroecto- 
dermal syndromes substantially increases the chance 
of a phaeochromocytoma being present. Rigorous 
screening should be performed in all first and second 
degree relatives but particularly in those with hyper- 
tension and prior to any anaesthesia. Phaeochromo- 
cytoma should be considered in all patients presenting 
with a hypochondrial mass, and appropriate investiga- 
tion undertaken if the initial imaging is consistent with 
this diagnosis. 
Initial investigation remains biochemical. Twenty 
four hour urine collection into concentrated 
hydrochloric acid for metanephrines or free 
catecholamines is the optimum, and both are superior 
to the measurement of VMA. Urinary values > 1 pmol 
(170 pg) of noradrenaline/24 h or > 190 nmol (35 pg) 
of adrenaline/24 h provide a specificity > 95% [27]. 
Spot urine collections immediately after a paroxysm, 
with the result expressed relative to creatinine, can be 
used to support the diagnosis and appear to provide 
good discrimination using > 0.57 pmol total 
metanephrine/mmol creatinine (1 pg/mg) as diag- 
nostic of phaeochromocytoma [28]. Plasma 
catecholamines are not routinely measured but do 
have a role in difficult cases. Samples taken during a 
paroxysm can be diagnostic [29], and selective 
sampling is sometimes necessary for localisation. 
Clonidine [30] or pentolinium [31] tests may be used 
to distinguish patients with borderline elevation of 
plasma catecholamines. Patients with autonomous 
catecholamine synthesis from a phaeochromocytoma 
show no suppression. In all situations where plasma 
catecholamines are measured, the conditions of 
sampling and specimen handling are critical. There is

preliminary evidence that plasma metadrenalines are 
much more reliable indicators of the presence of 
phaeochromocytoma than the parent catecholamines 
[35]. 
CT or magnetic resonance scanning are the most 
reliable imaging techniques for pre-operative localisa- 
tion and visualise virtually all adrenal phaeochromo- 
cytomas. Phaeochromocytomas are intensely bright on 
T2 weighted MR images [29], although this is not a 
totally specific characteristic. Recent figures for the 
proportion of phaeochromocytomas that are extra- 
adrenal range between 15% and 22% [5,13,32]. The 
majority of extra-adrenal phaeochromocytomas 
(> 85%) are found in the abdomen or pelvis [32]. 
Thus, if clinical suspicion remains despite the demon- 
stration of normal 24-hour urinary metanephrine or 
catecholamine excretion, a CT or MR scan of adrenals 
and sympathetic chain (including the organ of Zuck- 
erkandl) 
has considerable exclusion value. 
Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) labelled with 13II or 
123I is used primarily in the localisation of extra-adrenal 
tumours or metastases and in therapy [33,34]. 
Conclusion 
In this autopsy survey of recent UK experience, the 
diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma was made before 
death in only 17 patients (27%), a figure similar to the 
24% reported in a similar survey from the Mayo Clinic 
looking back over the years 1928-77 [10]. It is to be 
hoped that a wider appreciation of the possible clini- 
cal presentations, some illustrated above, and the 
appropriate use of modern investigative techniques 
will reduce the proportion of undiagnosed cases that 
predominate in these autopsy series.

Cellular Origin of Cancer:
Dedifferentiation or Stem Cell Maturation
Arrest?
by Stewart Sell
Given the fundamental principle that cancer must arise from a cell that has the potential to
divide, two major nonexclusive hypotheses of the cellular origin of cancer are that malignancy
arises a) from stem cells due to maturation arrest or b) from dedifferentiation of mature cells
that retain the ability to proliferate. The role of stem cells in carcinogenesis is clearly demon-
strated in teratocarcinomas. The malignant stem cells of teratocarcinomas are derived from
normal multipotent stem cells and have the potential to differentiate into normal benign
mature tissue. A widely studied model supporting dedifferentiation has been the putative ori-
gin of hepatocarcinomas from ""premalignant"" foci and nodules induced in the rat liver by
chemicals. However, the dedifferentiation concept for hepatocarcinogenesis is challenged by
more recent interpretations indicating that hepatocellular carcinoma arises from maturation
arrest caused by abherrant differentiation of determined stem cells. Either hypothesis is sup-
ported by the cellular changes that occur in the rodent liver after different hepatocarcinogenic
regimens. The formation of foci and nodules from altered hepatocytes supports dedifferentia-
tion; the proliferation of small oval cells with the potential to differentiate into either biliary
ducts or hepatocytes supports arrested maturation of determined stem cells. It is now postulat-
ed that foci and nodular change reflect adaptive changes to the toxic effects of carcinogens and
not ""preneoplastic"" stages to cancer. The stem cell model predicts that genotoxic chemicals
induce mutations in the determined stem cell which may be expressed in its progeny.
Proliferation of initiated cells is induced by promoting events which also allow additional
mutations to occur.
Introduction
Although analysis of carcinogenic events by modern
techniques of molecular oncology has greatly increased
our understanding of how malignant transformation
may occur, there are still basic questions concerning
the cellular process from which cancer arises. Given
the fundamental principle that cancer cannot arise in
terminally differentiated cells but must arise from a
cell that has the potential to divide, there are two pos-
sibilities: tumors arise from dedifferentiation
of
mature cells or from maturation arrest of immature
stem cells.

and Chemical Carcinogenesis that was held January 14-16, 1992, in
Research Triangle Park, NC.
Embryonal Theory of Cancer
The ""stem cell"" or embryonal origin of cancer may
have been the first generally accepted theory of the
etiology of cancer (1). The embryonal rest theory of
cancer has been attributed to Cohnheim (2). He pro-
posed that cancers arose from displacement of embry-
onic cells. At some stage of embryonic life, cells
become isolated or fixed while they still possess great
energy. These cells normally become differentiated in
the adult, but because of their isolation they manifest
embryonic capacity for continued growth in the adult.
Rippert (3) expanded the embryonic rest theory to
include the possibility that cells expressing embryonic
potential for growth could arise in the adult (dediffer-
entiation). However, Rotter (4) proposed that primi-
tive sex cells might lodge anywhere outside the ulti-
mate sex glands during development and serve as the
origin of tumors. He also thought that the growth of
epithelial tumors depended on primary changes in the
underlying connective tissue, which allowed invasion
and expansive growth of epithelium.
S. SELL
With the identification of cell-free filtrates (5) and
exogenous chemicals (6) that could cause cancer, the
idea that an infectious event caused dedifferentiation
of mature cells to form cancers became more popular.
The more recently developed concept of infection with
oncogenic viruses or of activation of proto-oncogenes
(7,8) as the causative events in cancer has been
explained by action of oncogene products on adult cells
causing transformation to malignant phenotype (dedif-
ferentiation). This explanation is supported by the
observation that transfection or activation of onco-
genes can cause proliferative changes in apparently
mature cells in tissue culture. However, the process of
carcinogenesis in vivo includes proliferation of less dif-
ferentiated cells, and cell lines in culture always con-
tain a certain fraction of proliferating cells that may
represent determined stem cells.
Stem Cell Tumors
The similarity of histologic appearance and growth
characteristics between embryonic tissues and cancer
is a major observation that supports the concept of a
stem cell origin of cancer. In particular, the character-
istics of teratocarcinomas, which produce a variety of
undifferentiated as well as fully differentiated cells,
are more consistent with a stem cell origin than dedif-
ferentiation (9). Teratocarcinomas contain structures
resembling presomite embryos (embryoid bodies)
intermixed with virtually every recognizable fetal and
adult tissue (10, 11). Pierce et al. (12) showed that tera-
tocarcinomas (embryonal carcinomas) not only con-
tained malignant presomatic cells, but also included
benign somatic tissue. In addition, the ability of trans-
plantable teratocarcinomas of mice to differentiate into
mature benign cells provides irrefutable evidence for
the stem cell origin of this form of cancer (13).
Transplantable teratocarcinomas were first pro-
duced by Stevens (14) by injecting the cells from the
genital ridge of F1 mice into the testicles of parental
mice. The normal genital-ridge cells grew in the testes
and gave rise to solid teratocarcinomas that have now
been passed for over 200 generations in inbred
parental mice (Fig. 1). When growing in the recipient
mouse, proliferating, malignant, transplantable terato-
carcinoma cells differentiate into benign cells located
in well-differentiated keratin pearls within the tumor
(16). Transplantation of the tumor-producing core cells
of malignant teratocarcinomas into normal blastocysts
may result in birth of normal differentiated adult cells
(17-19). Labeled embryonal-carcinomal cells localize
preferentially in the mural trophectoderm of the blas-
tocyst, in the primitive endoderm, and rarely in the
inner cell mass. The carcinoma cells differentiate into
differentiated cells in accordance with their localization
(20). Thus, at least for this form of cancer, the malig-
nant potential exists in the stem cell and may be con-
trolled by environmental factors present in differenti-
ating tissue.

FIGURE 1. Origin of malignant teratocarcinomas from normal germi-
nal cells and development of normal organs from transplantable
teratocarcinoma cells. Malignant teratocarcinomas were derived
by injection of normal genital-ridge cells of F1 mice into the testi-
cles of parental-strain mice. These teratocarcinomas have been
maintained for over 200 generations by transplantation and may
be grown in tissue culture. The malignant undifferentiated stem
cells of the tumor (embryoid bodies) may be transformed into nor-
mal tissue after insertion into normal blastocysts of a different
mouse strain and viable mosaic mice obtained. These mosaic mice
have organs containing tumor-derived cells, as well as cells of the
blastocyst, as determined by H2 tissue type, red blood cell type,
immunoglobulin allotypes, and isozymes from Sell (15).
Maturation Arrest/Blocked Ontogeny
The concept of blocked ontogeny, attributed to
Potter (21), is a postulate of the stem cell model of car-
cinogenesis and cell renewal as adumbrated by Pierce
et al. (13) In Figure 2, the undifferentiated stem cell is
represented at the left. During organogenesis, stem
cells differentiate to produce tissue stem cells. Stem
cells that are committed to form a certain tissue are
called ""determined."" The determined stem cells are the
cells that are available to proliferate to form a given
organ or cell lineage. The determined stem cells give
rise to progeny that begin to accumulate the molecules
of specialized cell types in their cytoplasm. During nor-
mal cell renewal the determined stem cell divides to
produce two daughter cells. One daughter cell remains
as a stem cell; the other daughter cell expresses a more
differentiated state. These differentiating cells are
capable of additional rounds of proliferation, eventual-
ly giving rise to terminally differentiated cells. Note
that in Pierce's model the existence of a determined
liver stem cell is highlighted by a question mark, and

FIGURE 2. Model of cell renewal and carcinogenesis. The stem cell is
depicted on the left with progressive differentiation to terminally
differentiated cells at the right (post-mitotic). Expression of the
malignant phenotype could occur at any stage of differentiation of
mitotically active cells. Initiation may take place at the level of the
stem cell, but tumors may appear to arise from more differentiat-
ed cells when additional mutations have occurred that permit
expression of the malignant phenotype. The top lineage would
hold for rapidly renewing populations of cells, such as the gas-
trointestinal tract, skin, and hematopoietic tissue. The second lin-
eage represents tissues that normally turn over slowly, such as
the liver. The question marks for the liver indicate that previously
the ability of adult liver cells to proliferate and replace destroyed
liver cells led investigators to conclude that there were neither
stem cell nor terminally differentiated cells in the liver. However,
more recent studies indicate not only that normal liver cell
turnover involves periportal stem cells, but also that mature liver
cells in the central zone are terminally differentiated. The bottom
lineage depicts nerve cells of the adult, which are terminally dif-
ferentiated, do not proliferate, and do not give rise to tumors.
Modified from Pierce et al. (13).
the presence of a terminally differentiated liver cell is
also highlighted by a question mark. In this article the
nature of the determined stem cell for the liver will be
presented, as well as evidence that there are terminal-
ly differentiated liver cells.
Is There a Liver Stem Cell?
The question of whether there is a liver stem cell
was posed in a recent review (22). The concept of the
liver stem cell and its role in chemical hepatocarcino-
genesis has developed from a number of studies of the
cellular lineage of chemically induced hepatocellular
cancer (23-29). There are two possible cellular lineages
of cancer during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis (Fig.
3): tumors may arise by dedifferentiation of adult hepa-
tocytes or by maturation arrest of stem cells. The
sequence of foci to nodules to cancer and the associated
changes in the enzyme content of nodular and carcino-
ma cells imply dedifferentiation of mature hepatocytes

The classic interpretation of the effect of chemical carcinogens in
producing so-called premalignant foci and nodules implies dedif-
ferentiation. The induction of proliferation of oval cells by chemi-
cal hepatocarcinogens is more consistent with derivation from
stem cell maturation arrest (blocked ontogeny).
(30-36). However, an origin from stem cells is support-
ed by the proliferation of small bile-ductlike cells that
arise at the portal zone, proliferate extensively, and
migrate between the hepatic cords to the central zone
(37-41). These small bile-ductlike cells are called oval
cells (39, 41; see Table 1). Oval cells contain markers
such as a-fetoprotein (AFP). (43-47, 53) and epitopes
identified by monoclonal antibodies (53-56), which are
also found in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) that
appear much later. Oval cells may differentiate into
normal duct cells or hepatocytes (41, 56, 58) or migrate
into persistent nodules where they may give rise to
HCC (55, 57). The relationship of oval cells to the foci
and nodules that develop during chemical hepatocar-
cinogensis was examined using four different models.
Carcinogen-Induced Oval Cell
Proliferation
The effects of five carcinogenic regimens that show
different kinetics of oval cell production, foci and nod-
ule formation, and serum AFP elevations are com-
pared in Table 2 and Figure 4. AFP is a serum protein
found at high levels in fetal serum that becomes re-ele-
vated in adults after liver proliferation or development
of HCC (20,59,60). In our studies serum AFP levels
were used to determine liver cell or oval cell prolifera-
tion early after carcinogen exposure, mitogen treat-
ment (including partial hepatectomy), and necrotic
liver injury, as well as development of liver cell cancer
later after carcinogen treatment (Fig. 5). In recombi-
nant, inbred mice, serum AFP may be used to predict
which animals develop adenomas or HCC and to select
animals for morphologic examination (61,62). Our first
study used the cyclic AAF feeding regimen of Teebor
and Becker (63). Although it was anticipated that AFP
would be found in foci and nodules during the early ele-

ma (51).

(c-myc and c-K-ras) in oval cells when compared to normal liver
(52).

oval cells represent proliferation and differentiation of a liver
stem cell and that foci and nodules are adaptive changes and not
precursors to hepatocellular cancer (55,56).

cell or transition duct cell (21).
vation of serum AFP, it became clear that serum AFP
became elevated before nodules appeared and that the
cells containing AFP were oval cells and not foci or
nodules (43-47). From these observations it was tenta-
tively concluded that HCC might not arise from foci
and nodules but from oval cells (Fig. 6).
A study of the early cellular events with dimethylni-
trosamine (DEN) was most revealing regarding the
cellular lineage of HCC (56). This model was chosen
because there was little recognizable early oval-cell

serum AFP elevation seen with the CD-AAF and Solt-Farber

and serum AFP elevation is delayed in the Solt-Farber model
until AAF feeding stops. Dimethylnitrosamine produces little

monoclonal antibodies OV6 and T6 (55). WY-14643, a nongenotox-

associated with early oval-cell proliferation during car-
cinogen exposure (60). In this model, HCCs appear to
arise from microscopic foci of atypical hyperplasia,
rather than from either oval cells or preneoplastic nod-
ules seen in other models. However, when monoclonal
antibodies were applied to identify different cell popu-
lations, the early appearance of oval cells was readily
detected (OV6+), and morphologic evidence of trans-
formation of oval cells to larger cells bearing the HCC
phenotype (T6) was seen (56).
Oval cells were also identified as the AFP-containing
cells in the Solt-Farber model of inducing HCC. This

or abnormal liver cell proliferation, such as development of the fetal liver, restitutive liver injury after partial hepatectomy or chemical

carcinomas. From Sell and Becker (60).
regimen was designed to produce rapid development
of foci, nodules, and cancer (65). Cells are initiated by a
nonnecrotic injection of DEN, followed by a 2-week
feeding of AAF, with a partial hepatectomy performed
after 1 week of AAF feeding. The AAF is given to
inhibit proliferation of the noninitiated hepatocytes
that would be stimulated by the partial hepatectomy
(PH), thus allowing the growth stimulus of the PH to
act on the DEN-initiated cells. However, this regimen
not only induces foci and nodule formation, but also
there is massive, early oval-cell proliferation. Later,
cells with oval cell phenotypes may be seen within per-
sisting nodules. This is interpreted to indicate that
even when HCC arises within a nodule, it may have
originated from the oval cell lineage (56,58).
The fourth regimen, feeding a choline-deficient diet
containing AAF (CD-AAF), was chosen to identify the
earliest proliferating cells after hepatocarcinogen
exposure. This regimen induces HCC rapidly com-
pared to other regimens and produces massive, early
oval-cell proliferation associated with elevated serum
AFP concentrations (66). Using autoradiography, it
was found that the first cells to proliferate were locat-
ed in the periportal zone, next to the bile ducts (50).
After 3 days, labeling of bile duct cells was seen, and
later many bile duct cells were labeled. The proliferat-
ing cells expanded across the hepatic acinus from the
portal triad to the central vein within 1 month. Differ-
entiation into both bile duct cells and small hepatocyte
cells was apparent after 2-3 weeks. Thus, in these four
different models of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis,
selected because of different cellular changes preced-
ing liver cancer, evidence for the development of can-
cers from oval cells in the liver was obtained (27).
WY-14643 stimulates peroxisome proliferation and is
a nongenotoxic mitogen (67,68) that induces short-
term proliferation of liver cells and elevations of serum
AFP early after administration (69), followed by a
prolonged period of little change in the liver. With pro-

Figure 6. Morphologic changes and serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) lev-
els during cyclic feeding of a-acetylaminofluorene (AAF). After
four 2-weeks-on/1-week-off cycles of feeding AAF (a total of 12
weeks), rats develop one or sometimes two hepatocellular carcino-
mas 24 weeks later. After each AAF feeding the livers of the rats
contain a progression of lesions from small foci of basophilic hepa-
tocytes to larger eosinophilic foci to nodules of increasing size that
distort the liver. If the fourth cycle is not fed, all of the changes
are reversible, However, after the fourth cycle most of the nod-
ules still disappear (""remold""), but hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) develops 24 weeks later from what appear to be persistent
nodules that do not regress (64). The progressive histologic and
enzymatic changes in the foci and nodules preceding the appear-
ance of HCC led a number of investigators to conclude that foci
represent initiated hepatocytes that may be selected by further
treatment to express the malignant phenotype (32-36). However,
there is also early proliferation of oval cells, which differentiate
into normal liver and bile duct cells as well as migrate into nodules
and transform into hepatocellular carcinomas. Elevations of
serum AFP are associated closely with oval-cell proliferation and
tumor development, but not with nodule formation.

gen-detoxifying enzymes (71,72). Later, AFP-negative
cancers are seen (69). Oval-cell proliferation has not
been clearly defined using AFP or monoclonal anti-
body markers in this model, and the cellular precur-
sors to cancer may be different from those of other
regimens.
Where Is the Liver Stem Cell?
If there is a liver stem cell, where is this cell in the
normal liver and what is its relationship to the oval
cells seen during treatment with chemical carcinogens?
Three candidates are the terminal duct cell (40,41) the
transition duct cell (22), or a periportal stem cell (51).
The relationships of these cell types is illustrated in
Figure 7. Earlier autoradiographic studies implicated
terminal bile duct cells as the precursors of oval cells
(40,41). However, the conclusion that oval cells come
from duct cells was based on autoradiographic studies
done several weeks after carcinogen exposure (41,74).
Using autoradiography during the first 3 days after
CD-AAP, the majority of the proliferating-cell popula-
tion was identified as a periportal cell, whereas after 3
days, labelling increased in the duct cell population
(50). These early labeled cells were identified by elec-
tron microscopy as small periportal cells, and later
duct cells, in particular, transition duct cells (22,51).
HEPATOCYTES
TRANSITION
Later, when oval-cell proliferation is at a peak, many
of the oval cells infiltrating the liver cords are transi-
tion duct cells (41). It is possible that both the transi-
tion duct cell and a periportal-liver-determined stem
cell have the potential to proliferate and differentiate
into duct or liver cells. Which cell is predominant may
depend on the degree of carcinogen stimulation or liver
cell injury. The greater the stimulus, the more likely it
is to involve the less differentiated periportal cell.
Bile Duct Proliferation
An argument against the terminal bile duct as the
liver stem cell is that stimulation of bile duct prolifera-
tion per se does not result in hepatocarcinogenesis
(42). Agents that selectively stimulate bile duct prolif-
eration do not induce oval-cell proliferation. Induction
of bile duct hyperplasia by nonhepatocarcinogens such
as bile duct ligation, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane
(DDPM), or a-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) do not
induce AFP or albumin-containing duct cells (75-77).
There is one report identifying AFP-containing bile
duct cells after ANIT (78), but this was not found in
our studies (75,76). Elmore and Sirica (79) have demon-
strated that ductular cells may be stimulated to prolif-
erate and differentiate into cells expressing mucin
(intestinal metaplasia) or cells resembling hepatocytes

FIGURE 7. Normal and neoplastic stages of differentiation in the liver. This figure depicts the architecture of the junction between hepatocytes
and bile ducts including the three cell types that have been implicated as giving rise to hepatocellular carcinomas: the terminal duct cells,
transition duct cells, and the putative periportal liver stem cell. Transition duct cells have tight junctions with hepatocytes on one side and
bile duct cells on the other (73). The thick arrows indicate the putative stages of restitutive cell renewal from periportal stem cells to transi-
tion duct cells to liver cells on one side and bile duct cells on the other. The thin arrows depict neoplastic proliferation. After exposure to
hepatocarcinogens, many oval cells have extensive plasma membrane appositions between hepatocytes and bile-ductlike cells, including
desmosome structures, tight junctions, and microvilli interdigitations (74). During cenogenesis, it is postulated that hepatocellular carcino-
mas arise from either the putative periportal stem cells or from the transition duct cells, or their progeny.

STEM CELL ORIGIN OF CANCER
histologically, but not cells expressing hepatocyte
proteins. This proliferation is most likely for bile-duct-
determined stem cells at the stage of differentiation
past that of the common stem cell for hepatocytes and
duct cells, perhaps the terminal duct cell. On the other
hand, the oval cells that appear after carcinogen expo-
sure share bile duct and hepatocyte phenotypes
(50,75,76). Thus, there appear to be two distinct types
of ductlike cell proliferation (80): one is nonmalignant
proliferation of bile ducts, the other proliferation of
duct-like oval cells that have the potential to produce
malignant tumors in the liver cell lineage.
Liver Stem Cell and Restitutive
Proliferation
One of the properties of determined stem cells is to
restore amputated or damaged tissue. For example,
the stem cell for the limb of the amphibian is able to
regenerate to form a normal limb after amputation,
but it cannot form other organs (81). The presence of a
liver stem cell has been questioned in the past because
it did not appear that a liver stem cell was required for
regeneration of the liver (Fig. 2). After PH or chemical
injury (CCl4, galactosamine) the liver deficit
is
replaced by proliferating hepatocytes that are derived
from adult hepatocytes (82-86). For example, after
two-third PH of the rat, each hepatocyte in the
remaining lobes divides once or twice within a 48-hr
period, without involvement of a stem cell (83,84,
86,87). In fact, AFP can be identified in large, dividing
hepatocytes after PH in the rat (88) and adjacent to
zones of liver injury after CCl4 injury in the mouse
(59).
However, with more severe liver injury, a liver stem
cell may be called upon to restore the liver. For exam-
ple, after severe injury with CCl4, Engelhardt et al (89)
found some small ovallike cells contained AFP, a mark-
er for proliferation, and Petropoulos et al. (90) report-
ed finding mRNA for AFP in small, nonparenchymal
cells. Tournier et al. (91) found large amounts of AFP
and mRNA for AFP after galactosamine injury in pro-
liferating oval cells. Oval-like cells may be seen in
human livers that have been removed after transplan-
tation when the donor liver has suffered too much
damage to restore normal function (J. Demetris, per-
sonal communication).
Stem Cells in Developing Liver
Determined stem cells are also the precursors for
normal adult cells in developing organs (13). In the
liver of the developing rat fetus, cells have been identi-
fied that have the characteristics of the oval cells seen
in the adult (53,58,88,92-94). At days 12-14 of develop-
ment, there are bipotential precursor epithelial cells
that are capable of differentiation into hepatocytes or
biliary epithelial cells (95-97). The ability to induce
pancreatic duct cells to differentiate into liver cells
(98-100) and for liver cells to differentiate into acini of
cells containing zymogen granules (101) indicates that
there is a common stem cell for liver, biliary ducts, and
pancreas. Thus, there appears to be a determined stem
cell in the fetus that gives rise to pancreas and liver.
Role of Stem Cells in Normal Liver Cell
Turnover
There is some evidence that the cells that make up
the hepatic cords are replaced by proliferating cells
that originate in the portal area and migrate to the cen-
tral zone, where they terminally differentiate and are
removed by apoptosis (102-104). It is proposed that the
heptocytes are formed at the periportal tract rim,
where determined stem cells interact with ductal and
stromal elements. The assembled unit then streams
across the three acinar zones until it reaches the termi-
nal hepatic vein where it is eliminated. The liver unit
replaces itself in a manner similar to, but much slower
than, the layered epithelium of the skin or bladder and
the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 8). In the skin, stem
cells located in the basal layer of skin divide to produce
daughter cells, one of which differentiates and migrates
to the next layer and eventually terminally differenti-
ates into a non-nucleated squamous cell (28,105,106). A
steady number of gastrointestinal lining cells is main-
tained by a balance of cells proliferating in the lower
levels of the epithelium to those differentiating in the
mid-level of the epithelium and exfoliated at the surface
(107,108). A crypt of the small intestine contains 4-16

proliferons. Normal cell turnover in the gastrointestinal tract,
skin, and liver appears to proceed similarly, but at greatly differ-
ent rates. The small arrows and asterisks denote the location of
proliferating stem cells. Proliferating cells may be demonstrated
in crypts of the gastrointestinal tract up to the opening of the
crypt, limited to the basal layer of the skin, and rarely in the liver.
Toxic or destructive events may increase the proliferation rate in
these organs so that proliferating cells may be seen in higher lay-
ers in the skin and in the hepatic cords. Induction of proliferation
of hepatic stem cells requires either massive loss of hepatocytes
or inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation by a necrotic dose of
genotoxic carcinogen.

actual stem cells in steady state, but up to 30-40 poten-
tial stem cells that may be activated to divide after per-
turbations that stimulate proliferation. In man, approx-
imately 1011 epithelial cells are shed every day in the
small intestine (107). It is estimated that the skin
replaces itself every 15-16 days (Jean London, televi-
sion commercial) whereas the liver may take over a
year (83). The number of potential stem cells in the
liver that may be activated has not been estimated;
oval cells most likely represent progeny of activated
stem cells. The characteristic of liver tumors may be
related to the stage of differentiation at which the
malignant phenotype is manifested (Fig. 9), as is postu-
lated for teratocarcinomas and other cancers.
Chemical Hepatocarcinogenesis
and Liver Stem Cells
Cohen and Ellwein (108) have recently emphasized
the role of cell proliferation in the induction of cancer
by chemicals. In considering the principle that two or
more mutations must take place before the malignant
phenotype is expressed (109,110), the role of chemicals

in inducing HCC may be either to induce a mutation
(genotoxic) or to stimulate proliferation (nongenotox-
ic), allowing internal or spontaneous mutations to take
place. In this explanation initiators induce alterations
in DNA and promoters stimulate proliferation of the
initiated cells, increasing the likelihood for additional
mutations to take place (108). Both promoters and
""endogenous carcinogens"" (111) stimulate cell prolifer-
ation and decrease the time that it takes to produce
cancers. Endogenous carcinogens are essentially hor-
mones that stimulate cell proliferation.
Lasting Effect of Initiation
One of the principles of initiation is that once a geno-
toxic event occurs, it will persist essentially for the
lifetime of the animal (112,113). In skin carcinogenesis,
it must be the stem cell that is mutated. Mutations
that occur in cells that have begun the differentiation
process will not develop into cancer because differenti-
ated cells are committed to terminal differentiation
and eventual death (107,108). This must be true for
skin and gastrointestinal and other epithelial cancers,
as the rapid turnover of these cells would remove call

FIGURE 9. Postulated levels of expression of carcinogenic events during hepatocarcinogenesis. The stem cell model of hepatocarcinogenesis pos-
tulates that carcinogenic events occur in proliferating
cells at some stage during differentiation, resulting in expression of the malignant
phenotype (blocked ontogeny). Because carcinogenesis most likely results from the accumulation of more than one mutation, it is likely that
the first mutation (initiation) takes place at the level of the stem cell and that later mutations occurring at the level of the transition duct
cells or in aberrantly differentiating cells (atypical hyperplasia or cholangiofibrosis) direct the level of expression of malignancy.
Hepatoblastoma may represent tumors that arise because of multiple mutations at the stem cell level. Tumors with combined features of
hepatocytes and bile ducts (hepatocholangiocarcinomas) may arise from multiple mutations at a later stage of differentiation. Hepatocellular
carcinomas arise from a still later stage of differentiation.

cells that have started the differentiation process with-
in 2-5 days for gastrointestinal epithelium, 15-30 days
for skin, and 50 days for pancreas (114). Although the
cellular turnover in the liver is much slower (up to 1
year), it is likely that the same principle holds for liver
cancer. It has been reported that the alterations
induced by chemical hepatocarcinogens may also per-
sist for long periods of time (115-117). For example, in
unpublished experiments of Becker (personal commu-
nication), administration of phenobarbital as late as 1
year after injection of a non-necrotic dose of DEN (50
mg/kg), which by itself does not cause tumors, gave
rise to primary HCC within 6 months. However,
because of the long cellular turnover time in the liver,
it is possible that a partially differentiated cell with the
potential to proliferate might give rise to cancer after
chemical initiation, thus fulfilling the maturation-
arrest postulate of the differentiation theory of cancer
(Fig. 2).
Hepatitis B, Hepatocellular
Proliferation, and Hepatocellular
Carcinoma
The incidence of cancer in different organs is closely
related to the rate of cell turnover (118). The incidence
of cancer of the skin and gastrointestinal tract is much
higher than that of the liver in the western world.
However, in areas of the world where hepatitis B is
endemic and infected individuals have a marked
increased turnover of liver cells related to liver dam-
age, HCC is the most common cancer (119,120). The
association of a higher incidence of HCC with hepatitis
B infection is most likely related to the increased
turnover of liver cells secondary to destruction of liver
cells, leading to stimulation of proliferation of stem
cells and other cells early in the liver acinus dediffer-
entiation proliferation (121). Similarly, increased resti-
tutive proliferation in cirrhosis is also associated with
increased incidence of HCC (111,123). This increased
liver cell turnover increased the likelihood of endoge-
nous carcinogenesis because of the increased chance
for mutations (108). In transgenic mice expressing
hepatitis B viral (HBV) proteins, liver cancer has
developed both with and without preceding liver cell
damage (124-130; Table 3). In addition, in transgenic
mice that express hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
and show progressive liver cell proliferation preceding
cancer, exposure to chemical carcinogens such as DEN
or aflatoxin results in HCC at a younger age (131).
Thus, chemical hepatocarcinogens or insertion of HBV
DNA at critical sites (132-135) may provide one muta-
tional event necessary, but not sufficient, to cause
malignant transformation. The increased proliferation
of liver cells induced by cell injury or mitogens (pro-
moters) allows accumulation of the other mutations
required for expression of the malignant phenotype.
Relationship of Carcinogenic Stimulus
to Proliferation of Stem Cells
Regardless of the cause of cancer, the carcinogenic
process includes proliferation of stem cells or their
determined progeny (13,28,136). Thus transforming
viruses, genotoxic chemicals, nongenotoxic chemicals,
tissue injury and repair, and developmental abnormali-
ties that lead to cancer all induce proliferation of tis-
sues requiring the participation of stem cells. In the
case of teratocarcinomas, it is multipotent stem cell. In
the case of cancer of different tissues, it is the tissue
determined stem cell. It is possible that all cancers
arise from some form of maturation arrest of stem
cells. However, nature usually has more than one way
to get to the same place. Both maturation arrest of
determined stem cells and dedifferentiation of mature
cells may be cellular pathways to cancer.

7543139,"CD28 and CTLA-4 Have Opposing Effects 
on the Response of T ceils to Stimulation 
By Matthew F. Krummel and James p. Allison 
From the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Cancer Research Laboratory, 
University of California, Berkeley, California 94720 
Summary 
The importance of the B7/CD28/CTLA-4 molecules has been established in studies of antigen- 
presenting cell-derived B7 and its interaction with the T cell costimulatory molecule CD28. 
CTLA-4, a T cell surface glycoprotein that is related to CD28, can also interact with B7-1 and 
B7-2. However, less is known about the function of CTLA-4, which is expressed at highest 
levels after activation. We have generated an antibody to CTLA-4 to investigate the consequences 
of engagement of this molecule in a carefully defined system using highly purified T cells. We 
show here that the presence of low levels of B7-2 on freshly explanted T cells can partially inhibit 
T cell proliferation, and this inhibition is mediated by interactions with CTLA-4. Cross-linking 
of CTLA-4 together with the TCK and CD28 strongly inhibits proliferation and IL-2 secretion 
by T cells, Finally, results show that CD28 and CTLA-4 deliver opposing signals that appear 
to be integrated by the T cell in determining the response to activation. These data strongly 
suggest that the outcome of T cell antigen receptor stimulation is regulated by CD28 costimulatory 
signals, as well as inhibitory signals derived from CTLA-4. 
R~ 
cent work has demonstrated that CD28, a protein ex- 
pressed on resting and activated cells, is the major 
costimulatory molecule for proliferation of T cells (1-3). CD28 
engagement via antibodies augments the proliferation of T 
cells in response to immobilized anti-TCR antibodies (4). 
Additionally, antibody engagement can supply costimulation 
to T cells encountering APCs deficient in costimulation (4, 
5) and prevents the resultant anergic state that otherwise occurs 
in long-term clones (4). Finally, Fab fragments of anti-CD28 
can fully block proliferation by costimulation competent 
APCs (4). 
Several lines of evidence indicate that B7-1 (CD80) and 
B7-2 (CD86) (6) are the major costimulatory ligands on the 
APC. First, a chimeric fusion protein of CD28 binds B7-1 
and B7-2 (7, 8). Second, anti-B7 antibodies block T cell acti- 
vation by a variety of APCs (9, 10). Finally, induction of 
expression of B7-1 or B7-2 by transfection with cDNAs confers 
costimulatory activity on cells that do not otherwise provide 
costimulation (11-14). Interestingly, APCs and especially den- 
dritic cells, which are thought to be involved in the early 
phases of T cells activation, express moderate levels of func- 
tional B7-2 without activation (6, 15). These levels increase 
nearly 100-fold with overnight activation, enhancing their 
APC function. 
B7-1 and B7-2 also bind CTLA-4, a close relative of CD28. 
Chimeric fusion proteins consisting of the ectodomain of 
CTLA-4 bind B7-1 and B7-2 (8, 16-18) and can block T 
cell activation by costimulation competent accessory cells (10, 
12). Notably, studies with soluble fusion protein indicate that 
CTLA-4 binds both B7 family members with an affinity ""~20- 
fold higher than that of CD28. This higher affinity probably 
accounts for the ability of the CTLA-4 Ig fusion protein to 
block costimulation in vitro (10, 12) and to suppress graft 
rejection and antibody production in vivo (19, 20). 
While the ability of CTLA-4 fusion proteins to bind CD28 
ligands and block T cell activation is clear, the function of 
the native molecule has been obscure. Originally identified 
as cDNA cloned from a subtracted CTL clone library (21), 
CTLA-4 is homologous to CD28, especially in the extracel- 
lular domain, and both contain a conserved sequence motif, 
MYPPY, thought to be involved in B7 binding (22). Recent 
work has shown that CTLA-4 mRNA is expressed within 
a few hours of activation (23). Studies with mAbs to both 
human and mouse CTLA-4 demonstrated surface expression 
within 48 h of activation. However, functional studies have 
led to different conclusions about its role in activation. Linsley 
et al. in a study of human T cells found that anti-CTLA-4 
antibodies enhanced proliferation of T cells activated with 
anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, suggesting that the function of 
CTLA-4 was to augment or sustain costimulation (24, 25). 
Walunas et al. found that both intact and monovalent frag- 
ments of antibodies to mouse CTLA-4 enhanced T cell re- 
sponses in allogeneic MLR, but that intact antibody inhibited 
proliferation under conditions where Fc receptor cross-linking 
was provided (26). These results suggest that CTLA-4 might 
play a role in negative regulation of T cell activation.

We describe here an analysis of CD28 and CTLA-4 sig- 
naling on highly purified T cells, noting the presence of B7 
on the T cells themselves. The results indicate that the two 
molecules have opposing effects on lymphokine production 
and proliferation, and that the outcome of T cell activation 
is determined by integration of signals transduced by these 
two molecules.

lated and fused with the P3X3.Ag8.653 myeloma line using a stan- 
dard polyethylene glycol fusion technique (28). Hybridoma super- 
natants were tested for reactivity to CTLA-4 Ig and for a lack of 
reactivity to CD4 Ig by ELISA (29). Hybridomas from positive 
wells were repetitively cloned by limiting dilution in the presence 
of irradiated mouse thymocyte feeder layers. Antibody 9H10 was 
specific for CTLA-4 by three criteria: (a) Reactivity against CTLA-4 
Ig but not CD4 lg; (b) the ability to block CTLA-4 Ig binding 
to B7 transfectants; (c) the ability to stain activated T ceils but not 
freshly isolated T cells; and (d) the ability to stain a CTLA-4 trans- 
fectant but not control transfectants. 
Antibodies. Antibodies used include anti-CD3 clone 50(02 (30), 
anti-CD28 clone 37.51 (31), anti-B7-1 clone 1610A (9), anti-B7-2 
(17), anti-Vqr3 clone 536 (32), anti-class II MHC clone 28-16-8s 
(33), and anti-IA a/b clone BP107 (34). Conjugates of these anti- 
bodies were prepared in our laboratory. PE, biotin, and FITC con- 
jugates of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 were purchased from CALTAG 
Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA) and PharMingen (San 
Diego, CA). 
T Cell Activation Cultures. Spleens from 4-6-wk-old BALB/c 
mice were harvested and minced, and suspensions were treated with 
Geys RBC lysis solution (35). Cells were cultured in RPMI con- 
taining 10% FCS and soluble anti-CD3 antibody at 10 #g/ml. 
Flow Cytometry. 2 x 10 s cells were suspended in 10 #1 ice-cold 
PBS/1% calf serum/0.05% sodium azide. Antibodies were added 
for 30 min followed by two 4-ml washes in PBS/calf serumAo- 
dium azide. Data were acquired on a FACScan | (Becton Dickinson 
and Co. (Mountain View, CA) and the LYSIS II program was used 
to electronically gate on relevant populations. 
Proliferation Assays. 
LN cells were isolated from 6-8-wk-old 
BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Iso- 
lated lymphocytes were obtained by mincing and filtration through 
nylon sieves. Cells were then treated with anti-class II antibodies 
28.16.8s and BP107 and a mixture of rabbit and guinea pig com- 
plement (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY). 
Viable cells were isolated over lympholyte 1.119 (Sigma Chemical 
Co., St. Louis, MO) and residual Ig-positive cells were removed 
by repetitive panning on rabbit anti-mouse IgG coated tissue cul- 
ture plates. Typical preparations analyzed by FACS | were typically 
found to be 99% Thyl.2 + with <0.5% B220-positive cells. 
Round-bottomed 96-well plates were used for all assays. Where 
indicated, wells were coated with anti-CD3 at 0.1/xg/ml in 50-t~l 
vol for 2 h at 37~ 
then washed extensively and blocked for 30 
rain at 37~ with complete RPMI 1640. T cells were added at 
l0 s per weli in 200/zi complete ILPMI 1640. For soluble assays, 
anti-CD28 was added at a 1:1,000 dilution of ascites, anti-CTLA-4 
was added at 10 #g/ml, and B7 antibodies were added at 2.5 #g/ml 
and 10/zg/ml for anti-B7-1 and anti-B7-2, respectively. For cross- 
linking assays, anti-CD8 was added at 4 #g/ml, anti-CD3 was added 
at 5 #g/ml, anti-CTLA-4 was added at 20 #g/ml, and anti-Vy3 
control antibody F536 was added to produce a constant total anti- 
body concentration of 30 #g/ml. Polyclonal goat anti-hamster anti- 
body (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) was added at a final con- 
centration of 20 #g/ml. All cultures were incubated at 37~ for 
72 h, then pulsed with 1 #Ci of [3H]thymidine for an additional 
16 h before harvesting. 
Antibody Incorporation onto Latex Microspheres. Sulfate polysty- 
rene latex microspheres of 5 +_ 0.1 #M mean diameter were ob- 
tained from Interracial Dynamics Corporation (Portland, OR). Ap- 
proximately 1 x 107 beads per ml were suspended in PBS and the 
indicated antibodies were incubated for 1.5 h at 370C. Anti-CD3 
was added at 1 tzg/ml to deliver the antigen-specific signal, and 
binding solutions were normalized with control antibody 536 to 
maintain a constant total antibody concentration of 5 #g/rot during 
binding. Previous data have shown maximal binding is achieved 
when this concentration is added per 107 particles (36). Beads were 
washed extensively with PBS and resuspended in I ml RPMI-10% 
FCS and allowed to block for at least 30 min at room temperature. 
1@ cells were incubated in 96-well cultures with 10 s each of the 
indicated bead preparation. 
Results 
Activation Induces Expression of CTLA-4 on Both CD4 + and 
CD8 + T cells. Antibody 9H10 was used to assess CTLA-4 
expression on freshly isolated and activated T cells. As shown 
in Fig. 1 A, CTLA-4 was undetectable on freshly isolated 
T cells. CTLA-4 was readily detected on T cells 48 h after 
stimulation by addition of anti-CD3 to splenocytes, and it 
was returned to resting levels by 72 h. CD28 expression was 
not greatly altered by stimulation. CTLA-4 was expressed 
by both CD4 § and CD8 § T cells, with significantly higher 
levels on the latter. 
Blockade of CTLA-4 or B7-I/2 Enhances Anti-CD28 Costimu- 
lation. 
To determine the functional consequences of CTLA-4 
engagement, soluble anti-CTLA-4 or anti-CD28 antibodies 
were added singly or together to cultures of purified T cells 
exposed to immobilized anti-CD3. As shown in Fig. 2, while 
anti-CD28 greatly enhances the minimal proliferation induced 
by CD3 stimulation, anti-CTLA-4 has no effect. This sug- 
gests that CTLA-4 does not function as an alternate costimula- 
tory receptor. Despite its lack of costimulatory activity on 
its own, anti-CTLA-4 markedly increases T cell prolifera- 
tion when given together with anti-CD28. 
At least two mechanisms could account for the potentiating 
effects of anti-CTLA-4: enhancement of activation signals 
or removal of inhibitory signals. Given the observation that 
anti-CTLA-4 lacked costimulatory activity on its own, we 
favored the latter possibility- that blockade of CTLA-4 by 
the antibody might prevent interaction of CTLA-4 on the 
T cell surface with B7-1 and/or B7-2 and thus prevent delivery 
of an inhibitory signal. This is further suggested by the ob- 
servation that anti-CTLA-4 Fab fragments have similar effects 
as anti-CTLA-4 mAbs in this assay system (data not shown). 
Since the cells used in our experiments were >99% Thyl + 
and contained no detectable MHC class-II + or B220 + cells,

Figure 1. Expression of CTLA-4 and CD28 on resting and activated 
splenic T cells. BALB/c splenic cell suspensions (2 x 10S/ml) were stimu- 
lated in vitro with 10/~g/ml soluble anti-CD3. (a) Cells were double stained 
with Thyl.2PE and either hamster Ig-control FITC, anti-CTLA-4 FITC, 
or anti-CD28 FITC. Data were electronically gated for Thyl.2-positive 
cells; CTLA-4 and CD28 expressions are shown on freshly explanted cells 
and after 48- and 72-h incubations with anti-CD3. (b) 48-h cultures were 
stained for anti-CD4 biotin or anti-CD8 biotin followed by avidin tri- 
color and FITCylated irrelevant or CTLA-4 antibodies. Subpopulation- 
gated data show modestly higher CTLA-4 expression on CD8 populations. 
this possibility would require that the T cells themselves pro- 
vide a source of ligand. As shown in Fig. 3, flow cytometric 
analysis revealed that the freshly isolated T cells did indeed 
express significant levels of B7-2 and trace levels of B7-1. 
To determine the functional consequence of B7 expression 
by T cells in our assay system, we determined the effects of 
anti-B7 antibodies on CD28-mediated costimulation. As 
shown in Fig. 2, anti-B7 antibodies by themselves had no 
significant effect on anti-CD3-induced T cell proliferation. 
The addition of anti-B7 antibodies to cultures containing anti- 
CD28 resulted in a threefold increase in proliferation over 
that obtained with anti-CD28 alone. A similar increase in 
proliferation was obtained when chimeric CTLA-4 Ig instead 
of anti-B7 antibodies was added to block B7 interactions (data 
not shown). The magnitude of the increase was similar to 
that obtained when anti-CTLA-4 is added to CD28-treated 
cells in the absence of B7 blockade. The addition of anti- 
CTLA-4 to cultures in which anti-B7 antibodies are present 
results in no further increase in CD28 costimulation; indeed, 
a slight but reproducible decrease is observed. 
Together, these results suggest that T cells express B7 at 
levels that are insufficient to provide costimulation via CD28 
engagement in the assay system used. However, perhaps be- 
cause of the fact that CTLA-4 has a much higher affinity 
than CD28 for B7 binding, these levels are sufficient to generate 
a signal that at least partially inhibits activation. Blockade 
of the CTLA-4/B7 interaction with either anti-CTLA-4 or 
antioB7 antibodies removes the inhibitory signal, resulting 
in an increase of the costimulatory effect of CD28 ligation.

Krummel and Allison 
in Fig. 2 suggested that soluble, bivalent anti-CTLA-4 anti- 
body was effective in blocking B7-mediated signals, but was 
inefficient in providing signals. We next examined the effects 
of using anti-hamster Ig to cross-link CD3, CD28, and 
CTLA-4 singly or together. As shown in Fig. 4, no prolifer- 
ation was obtained when CD3, CD28, or CTLA-4 were cross- 
linked individually. As expected, cross-linking of CD3 to- 
gether with CD28 resulted in potent costimulation, while 
cross-linking of CD3 and CTLA-4 had no effect. Co-cross- 
linking of CTLA-4 together with CD3 and CD28 consis- 
tently resulted in a 5- to 10-fold reduction in proliferation. 
This inhibition was largely reversed by the addition of IL-2 
to the cultures, suggesting that the effect is not caused by 
toxicity. Finally, cross-linking of CTLA-4 with CD3 and 
CD28 also resulted in a profound decrease in IL-2 produc- 
tion in the cultures (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that 
CTLA-4 can deliver signals that inhibit T cell responses to 
TCR ligation, and that the effects observed in the experi-

Figure 4. Cross-linked anti-CTLA-4 can diminish both proliferation 
and lymphokine production by purified LN T cells. 10s BALB/c LN T 
cells were cultured with the indicated hamster antibodies together with 
control hamster antibodies. Anti-hamster Ig antibody was added at 20 
/~g/ml to cross-link. Where indicated, anti-CD3 was added at 5 ~tg/ml, 
anti-CD28 was added at 4 ~g/ml, anti-CTLA-4 was added at 20 #g/ 
ml, and control was added to normalize antibody concentration at 30 p.g/ml.

CD28 and CTLA-4 Deliver Quantitatively Opposing Sig- 
nals. The preceding data indicate that CTLA-4 cross-linking 
in the presence of CD28 signaling can inhibit IL-2 secretion 
and proliferation. We next sought to determine whether sig- 
naling above the threshold for CTLA-4 inhibition is inde- 
pendent of the magnitude of CD28 costimulation, or whether 
the threshold increases as CD28 signaling increases. To ad- 
dress this issue, T cells were stimulated by incubation with 
polystyrene beads coated with a constant amount of anti- 
CD3 and varying amounts of anti-CD28 and anti-CTLA-4. 
As shown in Fig. 5, costimulation with increasing amounts 
of anti-CD28 in the absence of anti-CTLA-4 resulted in a 
gradual increase in proliferation, reaching at the highest dose 
a 1,500-fold increase over that obtained with anti-CD3 alone. 
The addition of increasing amounts of anti-CTLA-4 reduced 
that proliferation in a stepwise manner at all doses of anti- 
CD28. These results suggest that T cells integrate signals 
from CD28 with signals from CTLA-4, and the balance 
of these signals regulates the magnitude of the response to 
TCR ligation. 
Discussion 
The results presented here clearly demonstrate that CTLA-4 
does not serve as a functional alternative to CD28 in providing 
costimulatory signals to T cells. This finding is in agreement 
with earlier studies showing that CTLA-4 did not replace 
CD28 function in CD28 mutant mice (37). The finding that 
anti-CTLA-4 increases proliferation of T cells activated by 
anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 is in agreement with the results 
of Linsley et al. (24). However, the fact that a similar result 
is obtained when blocking antibodies to B7 are included sug- 
gests that this apparent cooperativity of CTLA-4 is in fact 
a result of removal of preexisting inhibitory B7-CTLA-4 in- 
Figure 5. Proliferation in response to a constant CD3 signal is affected 
by the relative concentrations of CD28 and CTLA-4 signals. 107 5 ~tM 
microspheres were coated with 1 ~tg/ml of anti-CD3, the indicated con- 
centrations of anti-CD28 and anti-CTLA-4, and control hamster Ig con- 
stituting a total antibody concentration of 5 pg/ml. 10 s coated spheres 
were incubated in 96-well cultures with 10 s purified LN T calls for 72 h, 
pulsed with 1 ~tCi [3H]thymidine, and harvested after an additional 16 h.

Opposing Effects of CD28 and CTLA-4 on T Cell Response 
teractions by the soluble CTLA-4 antibodies rather than a 
synergism between the two antibody-generated signals. The 
ability of CTLA-4 to directly signal is supported by the fact 
that cross-linking of anti-CTLA-4, either with second anti- 
body or by presentation immobilized on beads, results in in- 
hibition of both IL-2 production and proliferation. This di- 
rect demonstration of signaling by CTLA-4 supports the 
report of Walunas et al. (26) that CTLA-4 is a negative regu- 
lator of T cell activation. 
Our demonstration of a dynamic competition between 
CD28 and CTLA-4 indicates that in addition to CD3 and 
CD28 signal integration, there exists an integration point 
for CTLA-4-derived signals. At present there is little knowl- 
edge of the biochemical events that follow CD28 or CTLA-4 
ligation. There have been reports that CD28 stimulation results 
in induction of protein tyrosine kinase activity (38), and re- 
cent evidence suggest the Tec family kinase ITK represents 
one associated protein kinase (39). In addition, it has been 
demonstrated that phosphoinositides accumulate in T cells 
stimulated by ligation of CD28 with B7-1, suggesting an 
involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) 1 with 
CD28 (40). In this regard, it is of interest that the cytoplasmic 
domains of both CD28 and CTLA-4 contain the sequence 
YM/VXM, a motif found in several growth factor receptors 
that associate with PI3K (41, 42). Several recent reports have 
documented a stimulation-induced association between CD28 
and PI3K, and it has been reported that mutation of the PI3K- 
binding motif destroys the costimulatory activity of CD28 
(43-47). These findings strongly suggest that binding of PI3K 
plays an important role in CD28 signaling. With respect to 
CTLA-4, however, there have been contradictory findings. 
Whereas a chimeric protein containing the cytoplasmic do- 
main of CTLA-4 was unable to bind PI3K (46), another study 
1 Abbreviation used in this paper: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. 
reported the coprecipitation of PI3K activity with CTLA-4 
(48). In any event, these findings raise the possibility that 
CD28 and CTLA-4 might compete for PI3K and affect its 
role in subsequent signal transduction. 
It is also possible that CD28 and CTLA-4 signals might 
intersect at later stages in the pathway. It has been demon- 
strated that the CD28 and CD3 pathways intersect at the 
level of the MAP kinase JNK (49). CTLA-4 might in someway 
interfere with this coupling, thus preventing costimulation. 
Finally, it is possible that CTLA-4 signals might interfere 
with those of CD28 even further downstream by interfering 
with IL-2 transcriptions or mRNA stabilization (46, 50). 
Our results further suggest that regulation of the outcome 
of T cell stimulation is a complex process with regard to events 
at the cell surface. It is clear that in the absence of costimula- 
tory signals provided by the B7 family, T cells do not 
proliferate. It appears that even small amounts of B7, such 
as those present on T cells themselves, are ineffectual in sup- 
porting CD28-mediated costimulation of anti-CD3 responses. 
This appears to be less a consequence of the absence of CD28 
signal being delivered, but rather a result of an inhibitory 
signal delivered through CTLA-4. This implies that either 
CTLA-4 is quickly expressed after activation and aborts the 
response, or that CTLA-4 is expressed at functionally 
significant levels on resting T cells. At higher levels of B7 
expression, as might be encountered on activated dendritic 
cells and activated B cells, CTLA-4 expression on the T cells 
might become limiting, and the costimulation provided by 
CD28 becomes dominant. As expression of CTLA-4 rises 
after activation, the signals generated through CTLA-4 might 
become dominant and terminate the response. Decay of 
CTLA-4 expression with time would allow the T cell to re- 
turn to a state where the CD28 costimulatory signal would 
predominate. In any event, accumulating evidence suggests 
that in addition to antigen receptor and CD28-mediated 
signals, a third signal, provided by CTLA-4, is important 
in determining the outcome of T cell activation.

Summary 
We investigated the expression and distribution of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) (FGF-7) 
and its receptor (KGFR.) during reepithelialization of human skin. KGF mR.NA levels in- 
creased rapidly by 8-10-fold and remained elevated for several days. In contrast, KGFP,. tran- 
script levels decreased early but were significantly elevated by 8-9 d. A KGF-immunoglobulin 
G fusion protein (KGF-HFc), which specifically and sensitively detects the KGFR., localized 
the receptor to differentiating keratinocytes of control epidermis, but revealed a striking de- 
crease in receptor protein expression during the intermediate period of reepithelization. 
Suramin, which blocked KGF binding and stripped already bound KGF from its receptor, 
failed to unmask KGFR.s in tissue sections from the intermediate phase of wound repair. The 
absence of KGFP,. protein despite increased KGFR. transcript levels implies functional receptor 
downregulation in the presence of increased KGF. This temporal modulation of KGF and 
KGFR.s provides strong evidence for the functional involvement of KGF in human skin reepi- 
thelialization. 
T 
he interactions between growth factors and their re- 
ceptors play critical roles in normal development as 
well as in host responses to infection and tissue injury. In 
epithelial tissues, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) 1 (also 
designated FGF-7) appears to be one such important medi- 
ator (1). KGF is expressed by stromal cells and acts specifi- 
cally on epithelial cells in a variety of tissues, including skin, 
lung, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as in male and fe- 
male reproductive organs (2-6). The actions of KGF have 
been most well characterized with respect to keratinocytes 
in vitro (4) and in vivo (7, 8). The growth factor is a potent 
mitogen for human keratinocytes in culture and promotes 
the normal differentiation program (4). 
Evidence that KGF plays an important role in wound 
healing derives from recent findings in animal models. In 
mouse skin, the KGF transcript increased rapidly and to 
high levels relative to those of several other fibroblast

growth factor (FGF) family members analyzed in response 
to full-thickness wounding (9). In the porcine model, topi- 
cal application of KGF to both split and full-thickness 
wounds resulted in an increased rate of reepithelialization 
(10). Based on these findings and the known effects of KGF 
on human keratinocytes in vitro, we sought to characterize 
the in vivo modulation of KGF and its receptor in human 
skin during the normal wound repair process. For this 
study, we took advantage of a new approach for KGF re- 
ceptor immunodetection by means of a chimeric KGF 
ligand fused to the HFc portion of the IgG molecule (11). 
Materials and Methods 
Tissue Preparation. Patients admitted to the Plastic Surgery 
Unit of the University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" were selected for 
the absence of any hyperproliferative skin disease or dysmetabolic 
or immunosuppressive disorder, as well as for any other pathol- 
ogy affecting the healing process. Patients ranged from 20 to 50 
yr of age and required split-thickness skin grafts for unrelated 
conditions. Informed consent was obtained according to proce- 
dures approved by the Institutional Review Board of the univer- 
sity. The donor area was dressed with saline-soaked gauze. Three

full-thickness biopsies (of ""-~16 mm 2) were obtained from the 
same area. The first was harvested at the time of surgery under 
general anesthesia, that is, on day 0, whereas the remaining biop- 
sies were taken under local anesthesia (1.5 ml carbocaine, mepiv- 
acaine, with 2% adrenaline) at varying intervals during the post- 
operative period. The biopsy donor sites were repaired with two 
5/0 nylon simple stitches. Specimens were frozen in liquid nitro- 
gen for further analysis. 
125I-KGF-binding Analysis. KGF binding was performed us- 
ing t2SI-KGF labeled by the chloramine T method as previously 
described (12). 
Immunohistochemistry. Sections (5)xm) were prepared in the 
cryostat and fixed in a mixture of absolute ethanol, 1% acetone, 
1.0 mM tetracetic acid/ethanol for 2 rain, then transferred to 
100% ethanol followed by 50% ethanol and PBS, pH 7.4, and 
then placed on chromium-potassium sulfate dodecahydrate gel- 
coated slides. After preincubation at room temperature in 5% dry 
milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.05% thimerosal for 1 h, the milk was 
blotted from the slides, and the specimens were incubated either 
in the presence of the KGF-HFc chimera (11) or the control HFc 
IgG~ for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. In 
some experiments, tissue sections were incubated with a mouse 
mAb reactive with the Ki67 nuclear antigen (Immunotech, 
Westbrook, ME) at 1:100 in 2% BSA/PBS or mouse IgG (con- 
trol). After incubation, tissues were rinsed several times in PBS 
and further incubated in a three-step immunoperoxidase procedure. 
Immunoreactivity was visualized using 3,3-diamino benzidine 
tetrachloride (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) as chromogen 
according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, 
tissue sections were incubated with 100 I~M suramin, generously 
provided by the Drug Development Branch, National Cancer In- 
stitute, as described in Results. 
Double Immunofluorescence. For double immunofluorescence, 
tissue sections, prepared as described above, were incubated with 
KGF-HFc for 2 h at 4~ in a humidified chamber, fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and washed three times in PBS, 
followed by exposure to FITC-conjugated secondary antibody 
(affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG) (Cappel Laboratories, 
Cochranville, PA). The same sections were then incubated over- 
night with polyclonal guinea pig anti-human K1 serum (kindly 
provided by Dr. Dennis Roop, Baylor Medical School, Houston, 
TX) followed by biotinylated anti-guinea pig IgG (Vector Labo- 
ratories, Inc., Budingarne, CA) and subsequently Texas red-con- 
jugated streptavidin (GIBCO BILL, Gaithersburg, MD). 
RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis. Tissue samples 
were pulverized in the presence of liquid nitrogen and homoge- 
nized in RNAzol (TelTest). Total R_NA was precipitated with 
cold isopropanol (50% vol/vol), washed in 75% ethanol, and re- 
suspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mM 
EDTA). 20-p,g samples of RNA were electrophoresed on 1% 
formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes 
(Nytran; Schleicher & SchueU, Inc., Keene, NH). To evaluate 
the integrity of the RNA, gels were stained with ethidium bro- 
mide. After cross-linking of the RNA to the membrane, filters 
were prehybridized for 2 h at 42~ in Hybrisol (50% formamide, 
10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 6• SSC, and blocking agents) 
(Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and were hybridized for 20 h in 
the same solution to which [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes 
were added. Filters were washed twice (30 min each time) at 
room temperature in 2• SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice at 45~ in 0.1• 
SSC, 0.1% SDS, and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., 
Rochester, NY). Densitometric analysis was performed with a 
scanner densitometer (Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). 
Probes included cDNAs corresponding to exon 1 of the human 
KGF gene (13), a 110-bp fragment that detects the KGF receptor 
(KGFR) alternative exon (14), and the full coding sequence of 
the human vimentin gene (12). 
Measurement of KGF Protein. Tissue samples were thawed and 
homogenized with a tissue disrupter (Polytron; Brinkmann In- 
struments, Inc., Westbury, NY) in a solution (2 rrd/g wet wt) 
consisting of 1.0 M NaC1, 20 mM Tris=HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM 
EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 p,g/ml aprotinin, 10 p,g/ml leupeptin, 
and 10 p,g/ml pepstatin. Samples were sonicated (3 pulses of 30 s, 
power setting = 10) (Heat Systems; Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) 
and cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 g for 30 min at 4~ 
The 
protein content in the supernatants was measured, and all samples 
were adjusted to a uniform concentration before the assay. Super- 
natants were analyzed for KGF using a two-site ELISA. Briefly, 
96-well polyvinyl microtiter plates (no. 3912; Falcon Labware, 
Oxnard, CA) were precoated overnight with 50 lxl per well of a 
KGF mAb, 1G4 (8 Ixg/ml), and subsequently blocked with 4% 
BSA. Serial dilutions of tissue extracts (protein concentrations 
<11 Ixg/ml) were added to wells (50 Ixl per well) and incubated 
for 5 h. Wells were washed extensively with 0.05% Tween, 
0.02% sodium azide in PBS, and further incubated overnight 
with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (designated 9492) raised against 
human recombinant KGF. After extensive washing, alkaline 
phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tago, Inc., Burlin- 
game, CA) (1:15,000 dilution) was added to the wells. After 2 h, 
the wells were again washed and p-nitrophenyl phosphatate (2 
mg/ml) was added. OD was measured at 405 nm with an ELISA 
scanner (Bio Rad Laboratories). The concentration of the recom- 
binant human KGF standard (3) was based on amino acid analysis 
and extinction coefficient. 
Results 
Modulation of KGF and KGFR Transcript Levels during 
Human Skin Reepithelization. 
In an effort to investigate the 
modulation of KGF and its receptor during normal human 
wound repair, we initially measured transcript levels of 
each in tissue samples at various times after split=thickness 
grafting. The KGF exon I sequence was used as a cDNA 
probe because this exon is present at single copy number in 
the human genome, whereas KGF exons 2 and 3 are repre- 
sented at multiple copies (13). A KGFR-specific cDNA 
probe was derived from the alternative exon that specifies 
KGF high affinity binding (14). Each served as an internal 
control for the other in hybridizations performed on the 
same tissue RNA sarnpte. 
Fig. 1 shows results obtained with two series of tissue 
samples from different patients during the course of the 
wound repair process. In each case, KGF transcript levels 
increased substantially compared with the control at early 
times (1 and 3 d) and remained elevated, but to a lesser ex- 
tent, after 7-8 d. When standardized relative to vimentin 
transcript levels, the increase in KGF RNA was as much as 
8-10-fold at early time points. These results implied a ma- 
jor and rapid upregulation in KGF RNA expression in 
wounded human epithelium. When the same tissue RNA 
samples were hybridized instead with the KGFR-specific 
probe, we observed decreased KGFR transcript levels at 
early time points (1 and 3 d), with a subsequent elevation

KGF protein was extracted from tissue samples obtained at the time of 
surgery and 11 d after surgery. Serial dilutions of each sample were as- 
sayed along with dilutions of a recombinant human KGF standard. Each 
data point represents the mean value of duplicate measurements.

RNA was extracted from tissue samples at different periods after surgery 
and analyzed for KGF, KGFR, and vimentin expression by Northern blot 
analysis. A and B represent samples obtained from two different patients. 
Autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry, and the induction in 
KGF and KGFR transcripts is graphically represented at the bottom of 
each panel. Filled bars correspond to KGF RNA, and stippled bars corre- 
spond to KGFR RNA. In both cases, results were standardized relative to 
vimentin transcript levels. 
of 4-5-fold above control levels after 7-8 d. The early de- 
crease could reflect the loss of epithelial cells (see below), 
which normally express the KGFR transcript (14-16). 
""Increased KGF Protein Expression in Response to Split-Thick- 
ness Wounding. To establish whether increased KGF tran- 
script levels reflected elevated KGF protein expression in 
reepithelializing skin, we took advantage of an ELISA, 
which sensitively and specifically detects the KGF product 
(6). As shown in Fig. 2, tissue extracts from normal skin 
contained readily measurable KGF immunoreactivity. How- 
ever, tissue samples from the same patient taken 11 d after 
wounding showed KGF immunoreactivity at increased lev- 
els, corresponding to a sustained two- to threefold eleva- 
tion in growth factor concentration. Similar findings were 
obtained with other paired samples from control versus 
reepithelializing skin (data not shown). Thus, increased 
KGF transcript levels correlated with elevated tissue levels 
of the growth factor. 
Immunohistochemical Localization of KGFRs during Tissue 
Repair. 
We recently developed a molecular approach to 
generate a chimeric protein encompassing the KGF coding 
sequence fused to the IgG HFc domain. This molecule can 
be secreted efficiently from mammalian cell transfectants, 
and it combines the receptor-binding properties of the 
growth factor and the convenient detection properties of 
an Ig. Moreover, we demonstrated the specificity of this 
monoclonaMike growth factor-Ig fusion protein in the im- 
munodetection of KGFRs by FACS | 
as well as in tissue 
1371 
Marchese et al. 
sections (11). The expression and distribution of KGFRs 
were evaluated on sections of healing wounds using the 
KGF-HFc chimera. 
In control skin, KGFRs were specifically localized to ke- 
ratinocytes throughout the stratum spinosum. The pattern 
of staining was uniform around the cell surface. Little stain- 
ing was detected in either the basal layer or in the granulo- 
sum or corneum strata (Fig. 3 A). This pattern of staining 
was consistent with our recent findings of the distribution 
of KGFRs in normal skin (11). 3 d after surgery, there was 
a marked decrease in receptor expression (Fig. 3 B), and its 
lack or greatly diminished expression persisted through the 
intermediate healing period (9 d, Fig. 3 C). During this lat- 
ter time, the suprabasal epithelium was visibly hypertrophic, 
with larger cells as well as an increased number of cell layers 
(Fig. 3 C). The striking absence of detectable KGFRs dur- 
ing this phase of the healing process resulted in a reasonably 
well-demarcated junction between the hypertrophic region 
undergoing reepithelialization and noninvolved areas, 
which expressed KGFRs (Fig. 3 D). Of note, the absence 
of detectable suprabasal KGFR expression occurred during 
a time which the epithelium was substantially renewed and 
expressed KGFR transcript levels four- to fivefold higher 
than control skin (Fig. 1). At late stages in the process of 
reepithelialization (15 d), KGFRs remained undetectable in 
proliferating keratinocytes of the basal layer, whereas re- 
ceptor immunoreactivity had returned to the pattern of su- 
prabasat distribution observed in the control (Fig. 3 E). 
Absence of Immunodetectable KGFRs in Reepithelializing 
Keratinocytes Reflects Receptor Downmodulation. 
The absence 
of KGFR immunostaining during the intermediate stage of 
reepithelialization despite elevated KGF and KGFR tran- 
script levels could reflect receptors occupied by increased 
levels ofligand and, thus, not available for reaction with the 
KGF-HFc probe. Alternatively, the lack of immunostain- 
ing could be caused by functional receptor downmodula- 
tion. To differentiate between these alternatives, we took 
advantage of the knowledge that suramin, a highly anionic 
naphthalene sulfonic acid derivative (17), can interfere with

binding by certain growth factors (18). Table 1 shows that 
suramin dramatically inhibited specific 12SI-KGF binding to 
its receptor (Table 1). Moreover, suramin treatment was 
capable of efficiently removing already bound 12SI-KGF 
from cells (Table 1). Of note, the effects of suramin were 
completely reversible. Thus, washing of suramin-treated 
cells before ligand exposure was associated with 12SI-KGF- 
specific binding levels comparable to that of untreated cells 
(Table 1). 
We next investigated the effects of suramin exposure on 
KGFR detectability in tissue sections of control skin. As 
summarized in Table 2, the KGF-HFc demonstrated the 
expected staining of the stratum spinosum. Simultaneous 
exposure to suramin effectively blocked KGF-HFc bind- 
ing, but immunostaining was readily observed when tissue 
sections were first exposed to suramin and washed before 
immunostaining with KGF-HFc (Table 2). These results 
established that suramin treatment did not irreversibly im- 
pair the ability of the KGF-HFc to detect KGFRs. To de- 
termine whether suramin was also capable of stripping 
ligand already bound to receptors, tissue sections were in- 
cubated with KGF-HFc, washed, and then exposed to 
suramin. After a second series of washes, immunoperoxi- 
dase staining was performed. Under these conditions, no 
KGFR immunostaining was observed (Table 2), establish- 
ing that suramin was also capable of removing KGF-HFc 
already bound to KGFRs in the tissue section. In tissue sec- 
tions from the intermediate stage of wound reepethelializa- 
tion, which lacked detectable KGFR immunostaining, re- 
ceptor immunoreactivity was not unmasked by previous 
exposure to suramin (Table 2). All of these results pro- 
vide strong evidence that the absence of immunoreactive 
KGFRs during a time in wound repair when KGF and 
KGF1K transcript levels were both markedly elevated re- 
flects functional receptor downmodulation. 
KGFR Downregulation Is Associated with a Differentiating 
Keratinocyte Population. 
The striking lack of correspon- 
dence between KGF1K RNA and protein expression dur- 
ing the intermediate phase of reepithelialization was consis- 
tent with the emergence during this period of a suprabasal 
population whose phenotype resembled that of the KGFR- 
negative progenitor localized to the basal layer of normal 
skin. Alternatively, the cells might represent differentiating 
keratinocytes whose KGFRs were downregulated because 
of increased levels of KGF. In the normal epidermis, the 
expression of human keratin 1 (K1) is associated with the 
commitment of basal cells to terminal differentiation and 
the loss of proliferative capacity (19, 20). In an attempt to 
distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the 
localization of KGF1Ks with the distribution of K1 in 
wound-healing samples. 
In normal skin, we observed colocalization of KGFRs 
and K1 in cells of the stratum spinosum (Fig. 4, A and B). 
Whereas KGF1Ks were localized to the plasma membrane, 
K1 was present in the cytoplasm. At 3 d, the few kerati- 
nocytes observed in tissue sections lacked both KGFR and 
K1 protein expression, consistent with a progenitor pheno- 
type (data not shown). By 9 d, however, the pattern was 
very different (Fig. 4, C and D). Despite the absence of 
KGFRs, the same suprabasal cells were invariably K1 posi- 
tive compared with basal cells in the same sections that 
lacked detectable K1 expression. By day 15, wounds were 
reepithelialized (Fig. 4, E and b-), and the newly formed 
epidermis exhibited a normal pattern of differentiation mark- 
ers, with colocalization of KGF1Ks and K1 in cells of the 
stratum spinosum (Fig. 1, E and b]. Ki67 immunostaining 
confirmed that suprabasal cells during the intermediate 
wound-healing phase were nondividing. This marker of 
cells undergoing DNA synthesis (21) was localized to basal 
cells in control skin and was more prominently observed

terials and Methods. (A) In normal skin, KGF1K staining localized to the cell surface throughout the stratum spinosum. (B) At 3 d, no detectable staining 
of KGFRs is observed in the wound area. (C) At 9 d, during the intermediate period of healing, the reepithehalizing hyperthrophic epidermis appears vir- 
tually unstained. (D) On the same day, epithelial margins adjacent to a hypertrophic region undergoing reepithelialization show marked staining for KG- 
F1Ks. (E) At 15 d, the epidermis is totally reepithelialized, showing a pattern of staining comparable to normal skin; immunostaining with the HFc control 
was negative under the same conditions (data not shown). A and C-E, X400; B, X800.

ostaining was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Colocalization of KGFRs in the plasma membranes and K1 in the cytoplasm are shown 
in the cells of the stratum spinosum of normal skin. In the same section, the basal layer remains unlabeled for both KGFR and K1 (A and B). At 9 d of 
healing, the cells lack detectable expression of KGFRs, whereas in the same suprabasal cells, the signal for K1 is positive and irregularly distributed (C and 
D). At 15 d, tissue samples again show reactivity in cells of the suprabasal layer for both KGFRs and K1 (E and F). • 
in cells of the basal layer of keratinocytes during the inter- 
mediate wound-healing phase. However, Ki67-positive 
cells were not observed in hypertropic suprabasal cells of 
the same tissue (data not shown). Thus, the absence of de- 
tectable KGFRs in suprabasal Kl-expressing cells during 
the intermediate period reflects KGFR downregulation in 
the nondividing, differentiating keratinocyte population. 
As such, these results imply that KGF plays a functional 
role in wound repair and may help to regulate the commit- 
ment to keratinocyte differentiation.

Keratinocyte Growth Factor and Its Receptor in Wound Healing 
Discussion 
In these studies, we observed increased expression of 
KGF, an epithelial cell-specific paracrine growth factor, 
during reepithelialization of normal human skin. KGF 
transcript levels increased as much as 8-10-fold during the 
early postwound periods accompanied by an elevation of 
2-3-fold in growth factor protein expression in the same 
tissues. Elevated KGF transcript levels of even higher mag- 
nitude have been recently reported in a mouse wound- 
healing model (9). Studies in tissue culture have shown that 
a number of growth factors, including platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF) and TGF-ct, increase KGF transcript 
levels in human fibroblasts (22). Moreover, the pro- 
inflammatory cytokine, IL-lot, was shown to induce the 
KGF transcript by a mechanism involving increased gene 
transcription (22). Because a number of these factors may 
be elevated during wound repair, any or all may be impli- 
cated in the in vivo activation ofKGF gene expression. 
There was also striking modulation of KGFIL expres- 
sion. KGFP, transcript levels increased several-fold over 
basal levels in control skin during the intermediate period 
of wound repair. Whereas control epithelium expressed 
readily detectable receptor protein throughout the stratum 
spinosum, KGFP, protein expression was low or absent in 
the hypertrophic suprabasal keratinocytes of renewing skin. 
The lack of detectable receptors during the intermediate 
phase of wound repair might reflect competition for recep- 
tor binding by overexpressed KGF. However, we showed 
that suramin, which effectively stripped bound ligand from 
KGFRs, was unable to unmask cell surface KGFP, s in 
reepithelializing skin. It is well established that acute or 
chronic exposure to growth factors such as epidermal growth 
factor (EGF), PDGF, or FGF cause receptor activation and 
their internalization, which leads to a marked reduction in 
the number of cell surface receptors (23). Thus, we con- 
clude that the loss of immunodetectable KGF1Ls in supra- 
basal keratinocytes of reepithelizing human skin, under 
conditions in which transcript levels of both KGF and the 
KGFP, were increased, reflects activation and downregula- 
tion of the KGFP,. As such, KGF must contribute func- 
tionally to the reepithelialization process. 
Previous studies in tissue culture have shown that TGF-0t 
or EGF acting through the EGF receptor can block Ca 2+- 
induced terminal differentiation of human keratinocytes, 
whereas KGF allows this differentiation process to proceed 
(4). Moreover, in a porcine wound repair model, exoge- 
nous KGF increased fete ridge formation, as well as the 
thickness of the superbasal layers of reepithelialized skin 
(10). In the rabbit ear wound repair model, KGF exposure 
was associated with accelerated epithelialization with evi- 
dence of specific stimulation of the proliferation and differ- 
entiation of progenitors within the hair follicles and seba- 
ceous glands, in addition to the epidermis (24). Our results 
with normal human skin showed that suprabasal cells of re- 
generating epithelium expressed K1, a marker of kerati- 
nocyte differentiation, and lacked evidence of proliferation, 
supporting the concept that KGF functions in human 
wound repair in vivo to promote the keratinocyte differen- 
tiation process. KGFIL protein expression was also low or 
undetectable in the basal keratinocytes during wound re- 
pair, where the index of cell proliferation was increased 
several-fold over that of basal cells of control skin. Thus, 
KGF may also play a role in the functional downmodula- 
tion ofKGFP, s in progenitor cells, which have the capacity 
to proliferate as well as differentiate. 
Independent evidence for the effects of KGF in kerati- 
nocyte proliferation/differentiation in vivo derives from re- 
cent studies in transgenic mice in which KGF (25) or a 
dominant-negative KGF receptor (26) was targeted by the 
K14 promoter for overexpression in undifferentiated basal 
keratinocytes. The former was associated with hyperthick- 
ening of the epidermis (25), whereas the latter was associ- 
ated with epidermal atrophy, a reduced steady-state prolif- 
eration rate of the basal epithelial cell layer, and reduced 
epithelialization after wounding (26). Wound healing in- 
volves a complex series of interactions involving many 
different cell types and the release of growth factors and 
cytokines (27-30). In this study, the elevation in KGF pro- 
duction in association with the downregulation of its re- 
ceptor in keratinocytes during normal wound healing sug- 
gests a key role for this growth factor in maintaining the 
balance between proliferation and differentiation in the hu- 
man regenerating epithelium.

Summary 
Recently, four genes (TAP1, TAP2, LMP2, LMP7) involved or potentially involved in the pro- 
cessing and transport of major histocompatibility complex class I-associated antigen to the en- 
doplasmic reticulum have been identified. We now report the initial characterization of the bi- 
directional promoter for the human transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) 
and low molecular mass polypeptide 2 (LMP2) genes. These genes are divergently transcribed 
from a central promoter region of only 593 bp. Functional analysis using a bidirectional reporter 
system demonstrates the minimal 593-bp promoter is sufficient for concurrent expression in both 
directions. There is no TATA box homology at either end but there is a prevalence of GC boxes. 
Transcription is initiated at multiple sites for each gene without any of the TAP1 transcripts 
overlapping with the LMP2 transcripts. The region proximal to the TAP1 gene is required for 
maximal basal level expression of not only TAP1 but also LMP2. Furthermore, this region is 
necessary for tumor necrosis factor oe (TNF-oe) induction of both genes. Site-specific mutations 
of an NF-t~B element in the TAP1 proximal region blocked induction by TNF-cx in both the 
TAP1 and LMP2 directions. An adjacent GC box was required for basal expression of both genes 
as well as augmenting the TNF-oe induction of the distal LMP2 gene. In vivo genomic foot- 
printing of this region revealed strong protein/DNA interactions at the NF-KB and GC box 
consensus sequences. In vitro binding studies confirmed the capacity of the NF-KB site to bind 
p50/p65 and p52/p65 heterodimers and of the GC box to bind Spl. Thus, the promoter elements 
proximal to the TAP1 gene play a significant role in regulating basal and induced expression 
of both TAP1 and LMP2. The findings presented in this report clearly link LMP2 expression 
with TAP1 expression and provide additional suggestive evidence linking LMP2 to class I an- 
tigen presentation. 
p resentation of antigenic peptide in the context of 
MHC class I molecules is required for the intrathymic 
selection and development of CD8 + T cells (1, 2) and for 
cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing of infected or transformed 
cells (3-5). The regulation of class I heavy chain expression 
on the cell surface occurs at multiple levels, including the 
retention of empty class I molecules in the endoplasmic retic- 
ulum (ER) 1 until association with both/$2-microglobulin

(B2M) and antigenic peptide (6). This stable trimolecular 
complex is then competent for transport through the Golgi 
apparatus and to the cell surface. The class I bound antigenic 
peptides are derived from degraded endogenous proteins in 
the cytoplasm (7), a process that has been suggested to in- 
volve the 20S proteasome complex (8, 9). The proteasome 
is a multicatalytic, multisubunit complex previously demon- 
strated to be part of the ubiquitin-dependent protein degra- 
dation pathway and is found in all cells studied (10, 11). Two 
recently identified genes, low molecular mass polypeptide 2 
(LMP2) and LMP7, have high homology to the proteasome 
and are located in the MHC class II locus (9, 12, 13). This 
region of the class II locus was initially defined as important 
for class I cell surface expression (14, 15). While early studies 
indicated LMP2 and LMP7 are not essential for antigen pre- 
sentation by class I (16, 17), more recent results suggest that

these proteins quantitatively enhance the specificity of the 
proteasome complex by increasing cleavage after hydrophobic 
and basic residues (18-20). This specificity is consistent with 
the characteristics of peptides that are preferentially bound 
by class I molecules (21, 22). Therefore, the LMP molecules 
may increase the availability of specific groups of peptides 
for class I binding. 
Transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) 1 
and TAP2 are closely linked to the LMP genes in the MHC 
locus, and share homology with the ATP binding cassette 
family of transporters (14, 23-26). TAP1 and TAP2 form a 
heterodimer (27, 28) that resides in the ER and c/s-Golgi mem- 
branes (29) and transports antigenic peptides into the ER 
lumen for binding by the class I heavy chain (30, 31). The 
TAP heterodimer is critical for class I function since TAP1- 
or TAP2-mutant cell lines lack class I on the cell surface (14, 
24, 32-35). Reconstitution of the TAP heterodimer rescues 
class I surface expression in these cells. Furthermore, trans- 
genic mice deficient in the TAP1 gene also lack class I expres- 
sion on cells and have a severe deficiency in the development 
of cytotoxic T cells (36). The TAP1/TAP2 complex func- 
tions as an ATP-dependent peptide transporter and displays 
some selectivity toward peptides characteristically eluted from 
class I molecules (37). Peptides with a minimum length of 
nine residues and with a hydrophobic COOH-terminal amino 
acid are transported most efficiently (38). A recent study has 
demonstrated that the empty class 1/32M heterodimers 
physically associate with TAP in the ER (39) and then disas- 
sociate from TAP upon peptide binding to class I. This sug- 
gests that TAP may have an additional role in directly loading 
peptide onto class I and/or in retaining empty class 1/32M 
in the ER. Significantly, several studies have shown that some 
tumors and virally infected cells have downregulated TAP ex- 
pression, potentially as a mechanism to lower class I expres- 
sion and escape surveillance by the immune system (40-42). 
Thus, regulation of the TAP genes is critical to the develop- 
ment and integrity of the immune system, while the impor- 
tance of the LMP genes is less clearly defined. 
Analysis of the genomic sequence encompassing the human 
LMP2 and TAP1 genes revealed that these genes would be 
transcribed in a divergent orientation with only 593 bp 
separating the ATG translation initiation codons of the two 
genes (43). The close proximity of the two genes in reverse 
orientation suggested that they might share a common pro- 
moter region. In this report, we describe the coordinate regu- 
lation of the human TAP1 and LMP2 genes. The common 
593-bp intergenic region is sufficient to promote transcrip- 
tion of both TAP1 and LMP2. In vivo genomic footprinting 
and site-directed mutagenesis define a shared Spl-GC box prox- 
imal to the TAP1 gene, which promotes basal level activity 
of both genes. In addition, a shared nuclear factor (NF)-xB 
element coordinately induces both TAP1 and LMP2 upon 
exposure to TNF-cr, a cytokine involved in the upregulation 
of many immune system-related genes. The tight coordinate 
regulation through these elements suggests that the func- 
tions of TAP1 and LMP2 are linked and strengthens the ar- 
gument that the LMP2 gene product also plays an important 
role in the antigen processing pathway. 
Materials and Methods 
Cell Lines. HeLa is a human cervical carcinoma cell line (CCL2; 
American Type Culture Collection, Kockville, MD) grown in 
Eagle's MEM with BSS (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, New 
York) supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.1 mM nonessential amino 
acids, 2 mM t-glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. 
The cells were plated at 106 cells per 150 • 25-ram dish every 
other day and maintained at 37~ with 5% CO2. Raji and Na- 
malwa are human EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, and 
H9, CEM, and Jurkat are human T lymphoblastoid cell lines. All 
lymphoid cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented 
with 8% FCS and 2 mM t-glutamine. U937 is a promyelomono- 
cytic cell line. 
Constructs. The promoterless bidirectional reporter construct, 
HGHCAT, was constructed by cloning the human growth hor- 
mone (HGH) gene, obtained by digestion of pOGH (Nichols In- 
stitute, San Juan Capistrano, CA) with BamHI and EcoRI, into 
the NotI site of pBSCATSK+ (44). Orientation of the insert was 
confirmed by use of a diagnostic digest. The L-HGH/T-CAT and 
the reversed T-HGH/L-CAT constructs were generated by cloning 
the 593-bp LMP2/TAP1 intergenic region into the XbaI site of 
the HGHCAT vector (see Fig. 2 A). The 593-bp insert was ob- 
tained by PCR amplification of a cosmid clone (R4) containing 
the entire genomic region encompassing LMP2 and TAP1, by use 
of two flanking 26-bp primers: PCR1 5'GCTCTAGACCCTGCA- 
AGGCACCGCTC3' and PCR2 5'GCTCTAGATGGCACTCGG- 
ACGCCGTCY. Integrity and orientation of the insert was 
confirmed by sequencing of both strands. The constructs, TlmtGC 
and TlmtKB, were constructed by performing site-directed muta- 
genesis (45) of L-HGH/T-CAT with the following oligonucleo- 
tides: TlmtKB, 5'CAGCCTGTTCCTeG tACTagCCGAGAGCC- 
CCGC 3'; TlmtGC, 5'CGAGAGCCCCaaaCTCGTTCCCTCC 
3'. Deletion constructs are schematically displayed in Figs. 1 B and 
3. Construct names reflect the portion of intergenic promoter re- 
gion retained in the construct and are numbered relative to the 
TAP1 ATG codon. The constructs p461-1TAP and p208-1TAP were 
generated by digestion of L-HGH/T-CAT with unique enzymes 
that cleave within the promoter region (BssHII or NotI, respec- 
tively) and a unique Sinai site within the HGH coding sequence. 
The resulting recircularized deletion constructs have inactivated 
HGH reporter genes and thus can only be assayed for TAP-CAT 
expression. The constructs p593-457LMP and p593-207LMP were 
generated by digestion of L-HGH/T-CAT with unique enzymes 
that cleave within the promoter region (BssHII or NotI, respec- 
tively) and a unique XhoI site within the CAT coding sequence. 
The resulting recircularized deletion constructs have inactivated CAT 
reporter genes and thus can only be assayed for LMP-HGH expres- 
sion. The junctions for all deletion mutants were confirmed by 
sequencing. 
Transfection. All transfections were performed with 15 #g of 
total DNA by the standard CaPO4 protocol (46). To minimize 
sample variability, duplicate DNA precipitates were mixed and then 
half was added to each plate, one for the uninduced and one for 
the TNF-~-induced cells. 10 ng/ml of TNF-c~ (kindly provided 
by Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) were added to the cells

when changing the media 4 h after the addition of the DNA precipi- 
tates. Media aliquots and cells were harvested simultaneously 24 h 
later. Cell extracts were prepared and protein content determined by 
the Bradford assay (47). Cell extracts (30 #g) were assayed for chlor- 
amphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as previously described (48) and 
quantitated by phospho-imaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, 
CA). Media aliquots for the HGH assay were analyzed by radioim- 
munoassay (Nichols Institute). HGH results were normalized for 
protein concentration to account for differences in cell number. 
Primer Extension and RNAse Protection. Poly A § RNA was 
isolated by use of a modified oligo-dT method (49). HeLa total 
RNA was isolated by use ofKNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, 
TX). Primer extension analysis of the TAP1 mRNA was performed 
essentially as previously described (50) with a distinct 30-nuchotide 
primer for the endogenous TAP1 mRNA, 5'GCGAGAAGTAGC- 
AGTACTGTCCCCAGCCATY, and a 30-nudeotide primer for the 
transfected TAP1/HGH mKNA, 5'TAGCTAGATGGCACTCGG- 
ACGCCGTCCCGGY. Absolute product lengths were obtained 
by comparison to a sequencing ladder. Position within the pro- 
moter was assigned by use of a value obtained by subtracting the 
size of the coding region 5' to the primer, and the primer size, 
from the absolute product length. RNase protection was performed 
essentially as previously described (50). The template for the syn- 
thesis of RNase protection probes was constructed by inserting 
the 593-bp TAP1/LMP2 promoter fragment obtained by PCR 
amplification into the pCK cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, 
CA). The orientation was confirmed by sequencing. The TAP1 
probe was obtained by in vitro transcription (Promega Corp., 
Madison, WI) directed by the SP6 promoter from the XhoI linear- 
ized template. The LMP2 probe was prepared by in vitro transcrip- 
tion directed by the T7 promoter from the BamHI linearized 
template. 
In vivo Footprinting. In vivo methylation of cells and DNA prep- 
aration were performed as described in Pfeifer et al. (51). The 
ligation-mediated, PCg-amplified in vivo genomic footprinting was 
performed as originally described by Mueller and Wold (52) and 
modified by Wright and Ting (53). Three sets of upper strand 
primers and one set of lower strand primers were used to display 
the TAP1 proximal promoter. The sequences of the upper strand 
primers are as follows: Set I: R412Ap1, 5'AGTCGGCGAGAA- 
GTAGCY; R412Ap2, 5'TGTCCCCAGCCATC~GAGAGAAGCY;

Nuclear Extract Preparation and Gel Shift Analysis. Nuclear ex- 
tracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. 
(54) from HeLa cells grown in suspension to a density of 4 x 10 s 
cells/ml. TNF-a-induced extracts were prepared from HeLa cells 
treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-c~ for 15-25 rain before harvest. Gel 
shift analysis was performed as previously described (55). The oli- 
gonucleotides used as probes or competitors are as follows: Tlwt,

shift experiments were performed by preincubating 1/~g of anti- 
body for 2 h on ice with each binding reaction before the addition 
of the DNA probe. Antibodies were both a kind gift from Dr. 
A. Baldwin (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel 
Hill, NC) and purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa 
Cruz, CA). 
Results 
LMP2 and TAP1 Both Initiate Transcription fiom Multiple Sites 
within a Common Promoter Region. 
Primer extension and 
RNase protection analysis of messenger KNA obtained from 
several cell lines detected multiple transcription start sites for 
both genes (Fig. 1 A and summarized in Fig. 1 B). The TAP1 
gene initiated from at least 18 different positions within the 
first 120 bp upstream of the TAP1 ATG codon. The presence 
of multiple start sites is consistent with results for other TATA- 
less, GC-rich promoters (56). The 10 most consistent start 
sites found by primer extension of Raji cell mRNA are indi- 
cated in Fig. 1 and were confirmed in two independent ex- 
periments. An additional prominent start site occurs at 
""~ -427 bp. Examination of mRNA from CEM cells con- 
firmed the same pattern of proximal initiation start sites in 
two additional independent primer extension analyses. Only 
the bands that were consistent in all experiments are marked. 
These results were also confirmed by gNase protection anal- 
ysis of mKNA from U937, Jurkat, and HeLa ceUs (data not 
shown). The LMP2 gene uses three major start sites clustered 
at positions -37, -38, and -43 bp relative to the LMP2 
ATG codon in U937 cells. At least 10 other weak LMP2 start 
sites can be detected within the first 100 bp. These results 
were confirmed in five independent experiments and in two 
additional cell lines, HeLa and Jurkat. None of the LMP2 
transcripts overlap any of the TAP1 transcripts, and all of 
the initiation sites for both genes lie within the region be- 
tween the two ATG codons. Therefore, this region could serve 
as a shared bidirectional promoter. 
The Common Promoter Region Is Sufficient to Direct Tran- 
scription in Both Directions. The functionality of the region 
between the two ATG codons was assayed by first cloning 
this region into a bidirectional reporter gene construct. The 
593-bp sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted in ei- 
ther direction between two divergently oriented reporter genes, 
HGH and CAT (Fig. 2 A). The resulting construct when 
transfected into cells allows the simultaneous measurement 
of transcriptional activity in both directions. HGH is secreted 
into the medium and is quantitated by radioimmunoassay, 
while the CAT enzyme is extracted from the harvested cells 
and is quantitated by standard thin-layer chromatography CAT 
enzyme assays. Transfection of HeLa cells with the L-HGH/T- 
CAT construct results in significant transcription in both the 
LMP2 direction (HGH) and the TAP1 direction (CAT) com- 
pared with the promoterless control (Fig. 2/3). Transcrip- 
tion from the reverse construct, T-HGH/L-CAT, also pro- 
duced significant reporter gene expression in both directions.

of vector sequence flanking both ends. (B) Sequence of the entire 593-bp intergenic region (43). The ATG translation start codons are indicated by 
a double underline and the gene name. The most prominent transcription start sites determined in A are marked by solid bent arrows for LMP2 and 
open bent arrows for TAP1. The end points of the deletion constructs used in Figs. 3 and 5 are marked by a solid bracket and the name of the construct. 
Shaded boxes mark two functional transcription factor binding sites defined in this report. Open box indicates a potential initiator element (69). Dotted 
underline marks two additional GC boxes, and the solid underline marks the ISRE homology. Numbers along the right side of the figure indicate 
nucleotide numbering from the TAP1 ATG and are used throughout this report except when referring to the LMP2 start sites, which are relative 
to the LMP2 ATG. 
The relative levels of TAP1 and LMP2 expression can be de- 
termined by comparing CAT expression driven by TAP1 
(I~HGH/T-CAT) with that driven by LMP2 (T-HGH/bCAT) 
or, analogously, HGH expression driven by either end of the 
promoter. In both comparisons, TAP1 expression was approx- 
imately threefold higher than LMP2 in HeLa cells. Impor- 
tantly, this analysis also demonstrates that the vector and 
reporter coding sequences do not influence transcription un- 
equally in one direction. Thus, the TAP1 and LMP2 genes 
share a common 593-bp promoter region, which is sufficient 
to promote bidirectional transcription of both genes. 
Confirmation that the transfected constructs respond in 
a similar manner as the endogenous gene was addressed by 
determining the start sites for the transfected TAP1 gene (Fig. 
2 C). Primer extension analysis of RNA isolated from HeLa 
cells transfected with the T-HGH/bCAT construct with a 
primer complementary to the HGH mRNA sequence de- 
tected multiple initiation sites. Although the experiment is 
arduous, especially in TATA-less promoters, the initiation sites 
correspond well with the endogenous TAP1 initiation sites. 
The relative intensity of the bands does vary slightly; how- 
ever, no cryptic start sites are detected. This indicates that 
the bidirectional reporter construct is faithfully reproducing 
TAP1 transcription initiation. Primer extension of the LMP2 
transcripts was not successful due to the extremely high G/C 
content of this region. However, expression of TAP1 and 
LMP2 was not affected by reversing the promoter (Fig. 2 B). 
This provides a strong indication that the reporter system 
is not affecting the results and supports further analysis of 
the promoter. 
Deletions from Either End Diminish Transc@tion. The ini- 
tial approach to functionally defining the bidirectional pro- 
moter was to construct large deletions from either end and 
assay expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 3). For ease of discussion, 
all deletion points are presented relative to the TAP1 ATG 
translation start codon. Expression of LMP2 from deletion 
construct p593-207LMP is reduced to only 38% of wild type 
when ""~200 bp are deleted from the TAP1 end. The same 
200 bp proximal to the TAP1 gene are also sufficient to pro- 
mote transcription in the TAP1 direction (p208-1TAP). This 
indicates that the 207 bp most proximal to the TAP1 gene 
have a critical role in activating distal LMP2 transcription 
as well as the proximal TAP1 gene. TAP1 expression is not 
affected by the inclusion of sequences up to position 461 (p461-

The ratios of TAP to LMP expression are the averages of two experiments. 
Regardless of the promoter orientation, TAP1 expression was approxi- 
mately threefold higher than LMP2. (C) Transcription start sites from

1TAP), indicating that this central region (461-208 bp) is 
not necessary for basal activity of TAP1 transcription. This 
region also does not dramatically affect basal LMP2 expres- 
sion, as demonstrated by the similar levels of activity from 
constructs p593-207LMP and p593-457LMP. The central re- 
gion, however, may be important for induction of LMP2 
and/or TAP1 transcription, since significant homologies with 
MHC class I IFN-ol/~ response dements are located in this 
region. The smallest LMP2 construct (p593-457LMP) con- 
tains all of the LMP2 start sites and is sufficient for a low 
level of LMP2 transcription. However, the LMP2 proximal 
region does not have a major affect on distal TAP1 expres- 
sion (p461-1TAP). These findings reveal that both genes use 
promoter dements located within the TAP1 proximal region. 
In addition, the LMP2 proximal region is also essential for 
LMP2 transcription. 
TAP1-proximal NF-KB and GC Sites Coordinately Regulate 
Basal and TNF-cr-induced Expression of LMP2 and TAPI. The 
deletion studies suggested that the TAPl-proximal region could 
contain shared promoter elements involved in coordinate regu- 
lation of TAP1 and LMP2 expression. DNA sequence ho- 
mology searches of this region with a transcription factor 
data base indicated the presence of a consensus NF-KB site, 
an adjacent GC box, and an IFN response element (ISKE). 
These sites were obvious candidates for coordinate basal and/or 
induced regulation of TAP1 and LMP2. We initially chose 
to examine basal level regulation by targeting the NF-KB and 
GC elements by site directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4). Mutation 
of the GC box (TImtGC) significantly reduced transcrip- 
tion in both directions. The GC box was necessary for an 
approximately threefold stimulation of TAP1 expression as 
well as a greater than twofold stimulation of the distal LMP2 
expression. These findings demonstrate an important role for 
the TAPl-proximal GC box in coordinately activating both

sent TAP1 transcription. The deletion end points are all presented relative 
to the TAP1 ATG translation start codon, and a relative scale is shown

genes. Mutation of the NF-rB site (TlmtKB) did not alter 
expression of either gene in the uninduced HeLa cells. This 
result is consistent with the absence of active NF-KB in the 
nucleus of uninduced HeLa cells (57). 
TNF-tx is a potent inducer of TAP1 expression (58) and 
HLA class I genes (59). However, as yet no published studies 
of LMP2 regulation by TNF-ot are available. One mecha- 
nism by which TNF-ot exerts its effect on many genes is 
through the activation of the NF-KB transcription factors (60). 
We examined the TAP1 and LMP2 deletion and point muta- 
tion constructs to determine if, upon activation with TNF-ot, 
the putative NF-KB site functions to promote TAP1 and LMP2 
transcription. The wild type promoter construct (L-HGH/ 
T-CAT) is inducible •2.5-fold in both the TAP1 and LMP2 
directions upon TNF-~ treatment (Fig. 5). All LMP2 in- 
ducibility is lost upon deletion of the TAPl-proximal region 
(p593-207LMP), suggesting that elements proximal to the 
TAP1 gene are required for LMP2 induction. Concordantly, 
the same TAPl-proximal region is sufficient to promote 
TNF-ot induction of TAP1 (p208-1TAP). Mutation of the 
NF-KB site located in this region (TlmtKB) abrogates induc- 
ibility of both genes. Interestingly, the adjacent GC box 
(TlmtGC) is also required for the maximal induction of the 
LMP2 gene but not the proximal TAP1 gene. The effect only 
on the distal gene suggests that the GC box may function 
to amplify the adjacent NF-KB element over larger distances. 
These findings define a central role of NF-KB in mediating 
TNF-ot induction of TAP1 and demonstrates that LMP2 is 
also regulated by this cytokine. Most importantly, it describes 
conditions of coordinate and inducible regulation of TAP1 
and LMP2 mediated by identical elements. 
In Vivo Genomic Footprinting Reveals Bound NF-~B and GC 
Boxes at the TAPl-proximal End. Studies of the bidirectional 
reporter constructs dearly defined a functional importance 
for the NF-KB site and GC box. To directly address the im-

LMP2 basal expression. Relative positions of the NF-~B site and the adja-

by solid boxes. The constructs were assayed in adherent HeLa cells as de- 
scribed in Materials and Methods. Results shown are the averages of six 
independent experiments with the SEM and have been normalized to the 
wild-type construct, L-HGH/T-CAT.

LMP2 induction. Black bars indicate TAP1 induction. Shaded bars indi-

duction for each construct was determined by dividing the uninduced CAT

not assayed because the reporter gene was deleted in that construct. The

for the wild-type and site-specific mutants is the average of six indepen- 
dent experiments. Error bars represent the SEM. 
1464 
Coordinate Regulation of Human TAP1 and LMP2 
portance of these sites in transcription of the endogenous genes 
in an intact cell, we examined the in vivo promoter occupancy 
by in vivo genomic footprinting. In vivo genomic footprinting 
reveals the sequences bound by proteins when the genes are 
in their normal in vivo state. This approach therefore delineates 
the in vivo utilized elements and provides information on 
protein/DNA interactions that are physiologically relevant. 
Examination of the TAPl-proximal 200 bp with four sepa- 
rate primer sets revealed no in vivo contacts within the first 
98 bp upstream of the TAP1 initiation codon. However, a 
large cluster of DNA/protein interactions were revealed be- 
tween - 98 and - 146 bp on both the lower strand (Fig. 6) 
and the upper strand (data not shown, summarized in Fig. 
6). The duster of contact points was found in both B lym- 
phoblastoid cell lines (Karl) and T lymphoblastoid cell lines 
(H9). However, the contacts differ slightly between cell lines, 
with the most abundant contacts in the H9 cell line. This 
region contains the NF-KB site and the adjacent GC box as 
well as an additional protected GC box (labeled GC2 box). 
The most consistently bound site in all cells is the GC box, 
which was functionally defined above to be important for 
the expression of both TAP1 and LMP2. Significantly, the 
putative NF-gB site is strongly protected in the H9 cell line 
(Fig. 6), but not at all in the Jurkat cell line (data not shown). 
This corresponds well to the constitutively high levels of 
NF-gB-related subunits found in H9 cells and their virtual 
absence in uninduced Jurkat cells (61). The different pattern of 
NF-gB contacts seen in the B cell line may be indicative 
of different NF-gB subunits present in these cells. Occupancy 
of the GC2 box varies between cell lines examined. The site 
is strongly protected in H9 cells, not at all in Raji cells (Fig. 
6), and weakly in HeLa cells (Fig. 7). Binding at this site 
may have importance in modulating the expression levels in 
different cell types. 
Induction by TNF-ol Alters In Vivo Binding at the NFqcB 
Site. NF-KB is regulated by controlling the ability of the 
active subunits to be transported to the nucleus (62); thus 
induction by TNF-ol would be predicted to alter in vivo 
binding at the TAP1 proximal NF-KB element. We directly 
examined in vivo occupancy at this site in HeLa cells during 
TNF-c~ induction (Fig. 7). Before the addition of TNF-ot, 
HeLa cells show strong contacts on both strands of the TAPl- 
proximal GC box and weak contacts at the GC2 box. In ad- 
dition, there are two enhancements on the lower strand of 
the NF-gB element (lane 1 vs. lane 2 and lane 4 vs. lane 5). 
Treatment with TNF-ot for 15-20 rain resulted in a shift of 
binding at the NF-KB element to two partial protections on

human invariant chain gene promoter (63). The resulting TAP1 
in vivo binding pattern closely resembles that shown for the 
H9 cell line (Fig. 6), known to have high levels of constitu- 
tive NF-KB activity. These results suggest that TNF-o~ treat- 
ment of HeLa cells induces a change in NF-KB binding, leading 
to a more active transcriptional complex. 
TAPI-proximal NF-KB Site Preferentially Binds p50/p65 and 
p52/p65 Heterodimers While the GC Box Binds Sp1. As a com- 
plement to the in vivo binding studies, we used in vitro gel 
shift analysis to define the protein factors binding to the TAP1- 
proximal promoter elements. A DNA probe spanning the 
NF-KB site and the adjacent GC box revealed one very prom- 
inent band and several weaker bands (Fig. 8 A, lane I ). The 
TAP1 GC box has strong homology to a high-affinity binding 
site for the abundant Spl transcription factor. Oligonucleo- 
tide competition of the wild-type probe with a consensus 
Spl element removes the most prominent band and the fastest 
migrating band (lane 2). This competition reveals two other 
binding activities, labeled KB. Likewise, mutation of the GC 
box allows detection of the same two KB bands (lane 7). These 
two KB bands are specifically competed by a consensus HIV 
NF-KB oligonudeotide but not a consensus Spl element (lanes 
9 and 8, respectively). Thus, two complexes of different mo- 
bility interact with the TAP1 NF-KB site. The two bands 
labeled GC in lane I show specific affinity for the TAP1 GC 
box. The two GC bands bind to the wild-type probe and 
also to a probe mutated in the NF-KB site (lanes 1 and 4). 
Competition of either of these probes with a consensus Spl 
element removes the GC bands, while competition with the 
NF-KB oligonucleotide has no effect (lanes 2 and 5 vs. 3 and 
6). Thus, the TAP1 GC box forms two specific complexes, 
while the NF-KB site forms two additional specific complexes. 
Although the in vivo studies clearly displayed cooccupancy 
of the NF-KB and GC boxes, an in vitro complex containing 
both GC and NF-KB binding activities is not easily discerned 
in these conditions. The diffuse complex migrating slightly 
slower than the prominent GC band is visible only with the 
wild-type probe and is probably the trimolecular complex 
(lane 1 ). In addition, other multicomplexes may be masked 
by the large signal from the upper GC band. 
Antibodies specific for the GC box-binding protein Spl 
or several distinct NF-KB subunits were used to directly assess 
the identity of the proteins bound (Fig. 8 B). The upper prom- 
inent GC band is specifically recognized by antibodies directed 
to Spl, while neither preimmune nor anti-NF-KB-p65 have 
any effect (lanes 1-4). A small amount of upper GC band 
remains after reaction with the anti-Spl antibody and may 
be residual Spl or an antigenically distinct GC box-binding 
protein. The lower GC-specific band did not react with the 
anti-Spl antibody and thus may be a different GC box-binding 
protein. This observation is consistent with previous findings 
of antigenically unrelated Sp1 family members binding in gel 
shift assays (64). The specificity of Spl binding to the TAP1- 
proximal GC boxes was confirmed by DNase I in vitro foot- 
printing. Purified, recombinant Sp1 as well as crude HeLa 
nuclear extract strongly protect the GC box region in a similar 
manner (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that Sp1 is the 
major protein bound at the GC box; however, other GC 
box-binding proteins can not be excluded at this point. 
The panel of NF-KB subunit-specific antibodies shows that 
the lower KB band is diminished by anti-NF-KB-p50 (lane 
7), while the upper band is diminished and partially super- 
shifted by anti-NF-KB-p52 (lane 8). Both the upper and lower 
1466 
Coordinate l~gu]ation of Human TAP1 and LMP2 
bands are diminished by anti-NF-KB-p65 (lane 9), and a su- 
pershifted complex is generated. While the upper band is com- 
pletely abolished by the anti-NF-KB-p65, the lower band is 
only partially diminished. Neither band was recognized by 
the control preimmune sera nor anti-c-tel or anti-Spl (lanes 
6, 10 and 11, respectively). These findings indicate that the 
upper band is composed of p52 and p65 subunits, while the 
lower band is composed at least in part ofpS0 and p65. These 
findings together suggest that Sp1 in conjunction with ei- 
ther NF-KB p50/p65 or p52/p65 bind to the TAPl-proximal 
promoter and mediate transcriptional activation of both TAP1 
and LMP2. 
Discussion 
This report provides the initial characterization of the tran- 
scriptional regulation of the human TAP1 and LMP2 genes. 
Extensive evidence has demonstrated that the MHC class 
II-linked TAP1 and TAP2 gene products are peptide trans- 
porters required to provide peptides to the ER for class I 
binding. Furthermore, the TAP messenger RNAs can be in- 
duced by cytokines consistent with class I expression (1, 24). 
However, no studies on the transcriptional regulation of these 
genes have been published. Interestingly, many tumors and 
virally infected cells downregulate class I, and this phenomenon 
is proposed to allow these cells to escape from immune sur- 
veillance (65). Some of these class I-deficient, vitally infected 
cells clearly have class I mRNA. In addition, some tumors 
have a class I deficiency despite the presence of class I mRNA 
(66). Recently, the TAP1 molecule has been shown to be 
downregulated in some of these tumors, suggesting a mech- 
anism for the loss of class I surface expression (40, 42). It 
will be important to determine if this downregulation occurs 
at the level of transcription or later in synthesis. Although 
no studies have been published regarding the levels of TAP 
in virally infected cells, it will not be surprising to find some 
viruses that also target TAP1 and/or TAP2 to escape immune 
surveillance. Thus, investigations into the regulation of TAP 
gene expression will be critical to the understanding of tumor 
development and, potentially, viral infection. 
The genes for the proteasome complex subunits LMP2 and 
LMP7 are found in the MHC class II locus closely linked 
to the TAP genes. The significance of LMP2 and LMP7 in 
antigen presentation is not as well defined as the TAP genes. 
Cell lines deficient in both LMP genes are still capable of 
antigen presentation. However, a close examination of pep- 
tides produced when LMP2 and LMP7 were present indicated 
a shift in the endopeptidase specificity of the proteasome. The 
characteristics of the resulting peptides are structurally more 
related to those typically bound by class I. The LMP pro- 
teins are found in a subset of the total proteasomes present 
in cells, and their representation can be increased by cytokines 
also responsible for class I upregulation. Thus, LMP2 and 
LMP7 may function to direct the ubiquitous proteasome com- 
plex to directly serve the immune system. The findings pre- 
sented in this report clearly link LMP2 transcription with 
TAP1 transcription and provide additional suggestive evidence 
linking LMP2 to class I antigen presentation. 
The human TAP1 and LMP2 genes are divergently tran- 
scribed with only 593 bp separating the two ATG transla- 
tion initiation codons. The close proximity of the two genes 
suggests coordinate regulation, but this cannot be assumed. 
Several examples of bidirectional discordant regulation have 
been described. The human genes COL4A1 and COL4A2 
are separated by only 127 bp and are divergently transcribed. 
Mutation of several cis-acting elements within the shared re- 
gion has differential effects on the transcription of the two 
genes (67). The divergently arranged H3-II and H3-III his- 
tone genes are also differentially regulated (68). Although 
only 900 bp separate the two genes, each gene has its own 
set of c/s-acting elements, which have no effect on the other 
gene. Therefore, thorough characterization of the c/s-acting 
sequences within the TAP1/LMP2 intergenic region is neces- 
sary to understand the relationship between TAP1 and LMP2 
expression. 
We have shown in this report that the intergenic region 
is sufficient to promote transcription in both directions of 
a bidirectional reporter. The LMP2 gene initiates transcrip- 
tion predominantly from three sites clustered at -40 bp rel- 
ative to the LMP2 ATG codon. This site is occupied in vivo 
(Wright, K. L., unpublished observation) and shows partial 
homology to the initiator element of the erythroid por- 
phobilinogen deaminase gene (69). This is also the predomi- 
nant initiation site of the mouse LMP2 gene (70). The TAP1 
gene uses multiple start sites spread throughout the first 120 
bp relative to the TAP1 ATG codon. An additional start site 
occurs at a far upstream location (~ -427 bp). The upstream 
start site aligns with the major mouse TAP1 transcript; how- 
ever, it has not yet been determined if the mouse TAP1 gene 
also uses the proximal start sites (70). Significantly, there is 
strong homology between mice and humans in this TAP1- 
proximal region. 
The human TAP1 and LMP2 genes are coordinately regu- 
lated by the common use of at least two TAPl-proximal ele- 
ments, an Spl-GC box and NF-KB site. In vivo genomic foot- 
printing revealed that both of these sites are occupied in cells. 
The Spl-GC box upregulates basal transcription of both genes 
two- to threefold. Furthermore, the adjacent NF-KB element 
mediates induction of both TAP1 and LMP2 in response to 
TNF-oe treatment. The Spl-GC box is also required for the 
full induction of the distal LMP2 gene. One possible role 
for the Spl-GC box in this induction is to amplify the effects 
of the adjacent NF-KB site over a greater distance. This would 
be consistent with the observation that the proximal TAP1 
gene requires only the NF-KB site but not the Spl-GC box 
for TNF-oL induction. In addition, in vivo occupancy of the 
Spl-GC box is constitutive, while the NF-KB binding is modu- 
lated on TNF-oe induction. This region is also highly con- 
served in the mouse promoter, with a 7-bp insert between 
the two elements (71). This conservation suggests that the 
mouse genes may also use these sites for coordinate regula- 
tion of TAP1 and LMP2. 
TNF-oe treatment of HeLa cells induces the binding of at 
1467 
Wright et al. 
least two forms of NF-KB to bind the TAP1 proximal site, 
pS0/p65 and p52/p65. Both of these heterodimers have pre- 
viously been shown to be activators of transcription (72, 73). 
Uninduced HeLa cells contain nuclear pS0/p50 homodimers 
(57), and this may correlate with the distinct pattern of in 
vivo NF-KB occupancy observed on the uninduced TAP1 pro- 
moter. Interestingly, p50/p50 homodimers have been impli- 
cated in repressing transcription (74). However, there may 
be a complex interplay between the NF-KB element and the 
SP1-GC box since mutation of the NF-KB site in the context 
of a wild-type GC box did not significantly increase tran- 
scription. 
TNF-ot is also one of the cytokines that induces class I 
transcription (75). Fine mapping of the class I response ele- 
ment has previously identified a highly conserved NF-KB site 
located in the enhancer A domain (57). The common use 
of NF-KB to induce TAP1 and LMP2 concordantly with class 
I activation suggests a direct mechanism to link transporter 
levels with increases in class I production. Importantly, it 
also provides further credence for a significant role for LMP2 
in the immune response. Likewise, class I and TAP1 are both 
upregulated by IFN-3' (24, 75). The putative ISRE element, 
located in the intergenic promoter (Fig. 1 B), appears to be 
important for upregulation of both LMP2 and TAP1 by IFN-y 
(White, L. C., manuscript in preparation) and could also serve 
to increase transporter levels during the activation of an im- 
mune response. 
These findings now provide a basis to examine the tran- 
scriptional control of TAP1 and LMP2 and have demonstrated 
that these genes are coordinately regulated. Coordinate regu- 
lation of LMP2 with TAP1 is an important finding, suggesting 
a functional linkage between the two gene products and 
thereby placing LMP2 in the class I antigen presentation 
pathway. Furthermore, the study of TAP1 and LMP2 regu- 
lation may enable the design of new strategies to upregulate 
class I during cancer and viral infections.

Ovarian metastases from prinary gastrointestinal malignancies: the Royal
Marsden Hospital experience and implications for adjuvant treatment
AE Taylor, VMC Nicolson and D Cunningham
The CRC Section of Medicine and the GI Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden Hospital, Downs Road,
Sutton, Surrey, UK.
Siary
We ingated the pattern and frequency of ovarian metastases in patients with primary gastro-
intestinal malgnancies and evaluated the response to surgery, chemoterapy and
three ca
radiothrapy.
The
lterature
reports
that
ths
group
of patients
have
a
poor
prognosis,
but
no
report
has
addressed
the response to chemotherapy. Using a database which is generated
poetl, we analyse
51
patients
with
primary
astrointestinal
malignances
and
ovarian
netastases.
All
paiets
recived
chemotherapy but only 36 were evaluable for response; five had adjuvant treatment and ten had non-
measurable diseas. Seventeen patients had surgical oophorectomy and three patients received radiotherapy.
Tlhe overall response rate to chemotherapy was 22%; eight partial
Lesponses and no complete
rsonses. When
straified
ing to site of response, 11 (31%) patients had a partial response at sites of extraovarian
metastases and only five (14%) had a partial response in the ovaries. Seven patients with primary colorectal
cancer had a differential response in favour of extaovarian sites. The median survival was 9 months for the 51
patients. Thee
premenopausal women with reseted gastric
ived adjuvant chemotherapy and
relapsed
only
in
the
ovaries.
In primary
colorectal
tumours
the
response
of ovarian
measases
to
chemotherapy is less than that for other sites. Tberefore, the ovary may be a sanctuary site for metastase
which has important impations for adjuvant chemotherapy in women. These women could be followed up
regularly by transvaginal utrasonography to detect such meastases at an early stage when they would be
amenable to surgical
resetion. Surgery should be
idered for sected patients who develop metachronous
metastases,
as patients may be rendered
diseas
free
for
several months.
Keyword= ovarian meastases; colorectal adjuvant chemotherapy
The ovary is a relatively frequent site of metastases from
malignant neoplasms arising anywhere in the body. Ovarian
metastases constitute 76% of genital tract metastases from
extragenital primary tumours, of which 78%
arise in the
gastrointestinal
tract
(Mazur
et
al.,
1984).
Secondary
tumours of the ovary constitute 10% of all ovarian neo-
plasms (Blaustein, 1982). In premenopausal women with col-
orectal cancer the incidence of ovarian metastases either
found at the time of initial surgery or developing subse-
quently is reported to be between 13.2% and 25% (Recalde
et al., 1974; Walton et al., 1976; MacKeigan and Ferguson,
1979). Similar rates have been reported for stomach cancer
(Warren and Macomber, 1935; Webb et al., 1975). The term
'Krukenberg tumour' has become dinically synonymous with
the pnce of any metastasis to the ovaries, although
purists contend that true Krukenberg tumours should meet
the criteria established by Novak and Gray in 1938 and
currently used by the WHO (Serov and Scully, 1973):
(1) presence of cancer in the ovary;
(2) intracellular mucin production by neoplastic signet-ring
cells; and
(3) diffuse sarcomatoid proliferation of the ovarian stroma
When lesions of this particular histology are analysed in
terms of the primary neoplasn, gastric carcinoma is the most
common source of ovarian metastases (Hale, 1968; Woodruff
and Novak,
1960). Other ovarian metastases are of non-
Krukenberg type and at times may be difficult to distinguish
from primary ovanan carcnoma. The frequent use of com-
puteised tomographic (CT)
nning nowadays to assess and
follow up patients with tumours of the gastrointestinal tract
results in the discovery of otherwise unsuspected ovarian
metastases, the features of which are described in a separate
report (in preparation). Many of the patients in this report
did not have histological confirmation of malignancy in the
ovary because they had never undergone oophorectomy.

However,
the
unequivocal
change
in
ovarian
size
and
appearance over the course of a patient's illness was consis-
tent with malignant involvement.
This report reviews ovarian metastases from primary gas-
trointestinal mlimanci
regardless of whether they were
classal Krukenberg tumours or non-Krukenberg tumours,
as in many instances
it was not possible to differentiate
between
the
two. The pathologial
features of cl
Krukenberg tumours are well described elsewhere (Wong et
al.,
1986).
assical Krukenberg tumours are reported to
occur in younger premenopausal women, occasionally occur-
ring during or shortly after pregnancy (Ward, 1966; Holz and
Hart,
1982), suggesting a hormonal effect as one of the
aetiological factors in its occurrence.
It has been postulated that the rearrangement of the
ovarian surface in the post-ovulatory period and increased
vascularity favour the seeding and growth of metastases
(Sternberg, 1963). The diagnosis of Krukenberg tumours has
been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis (Mason
and Kovalich, 1981), but the use of aggressive chemotherapy
or surgery in these patients is not well described. Endo-
crinological symptoms related to ovarian dysfunction have
been
reported
(Raquiz,
1991;
Scully
and
Richardson,
1961).
In this report we describe the clinical fings in patients
with ovarian metastases in association with a primary gastro-
intestinal malignancy. Metastases were documented either
surgically or by serial computerised tomography of the pel-
vis. All patients received chemotherapy at some stage of their
illness, and we have a
the response to treatment. In
addition, some patients underwent resection of their ovarian
metastases, and three had pelvic radiotherapy. The potential
benefits of these two therapeutic modalities are dis
ed.
Mdteiak and
Patients
Using a database which is generated prospectively, we have
analysed all patients presenting to the Royal Marsden Hos-
AE Ta
et
AET;bor et atw
pital with primary gastrointestinal malignancies who at some
stage
developed
ovarian
metastases
(antechronous,
syn-
chronous or metachronous). Patients of any age were in-
cluded if they had histological confirmation of a primary
tumour in the gastrointstinal tract (oesophagus, stomach,
pancreas, colon or rectum) as reviwed by a pathologist at
the Royal Marsden Hospital or ovarian metastases confirmed
at surgery or demonstrated on a series of CT pelvis scans
reviewed retrospectively by the same radiologist. Patients
were excluded if they had dual malignancies or a past history
of malignancies outside the gastroiestial tract (with the
exception of squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or
in
situ carcinoma of the cervix).
Patients were included
regardless of the treatment received, but over this time period
all patients received chemotherapy. Patient characteristics are
shown in Table I.
Assessnent of response
Patients were evaluated before treatment by clinical exaimna-
tion, chest radiography, CT abdomen/pehlis and blood tests
for biochemistry, haematology and CEA (carcinoembryonic
antigen). Patients were re-evaluated on subsequent occasions
according to the type of treatment they were reiving, Re-
sponse was defined according to WHO criteria as follows:
complete response (CR), the disappearance of all known
diseas
as determined by two separate obsrvations separated
by no kss than 4 weeks; partial remission (PR), a >50%
decrease in the product of bidimensionally measured lesions
as determined by two obsrvations separated by no less than
4 weeks and the absence of new lesions; stable disease (SD),
a <50% decrease and a <25% increase in the product of
bidimensionally measured lesions; and progressive di
(PD), a >25% increase in the size of measurable lesions
and/or the appearance of new lesions.
Statistis
Binomial confidence intervals for the response rates were
alculated usig the method of tail probabilities.
Treatment
Seventeen patients underwent surgery for removal of their
ovarian metastases, and the time of surgery in relation to the
diagnosis of the priary tumour was: antechronous, two
cases;
synchronous,
four
cases;
metachronous,
11
cases
(Table II). Tlwhree patients with metachronous ovarian meta-
stases had received adjuvant chemotherapy for resected gas-
tric carcinoma and the ovary was the sole site of relapse. All

Res
Patient characteristics (Table H)
Fifty-one patients were found to have ovarian metastases out
of a total of 828 patients with primary gastrointesinal malig-
nancies over the period September 1989 to May 1993, which
represents 6.2% of all cases and 16% of female cases. The
site of the primary tumour was: colorectal, 25 cases; oeso-
phagogastric, 19 cases; small bowel, two cases; pancreas, two
cases; and unknown primary three cases (two found to be
pancreas
at autopsy). The histology of the primary tumour
was adenocarcinoma in 49 cases; small cell carcnoma in one
case and carcinoid tumour in one case. Patients were aged
from 33 to 76 years (median 49 years); 50% were less than 50
years, one patient was post-partum and one patient had been
receiving
the
ovulatory-stimulating
hormone clomiphee.
Twenty-nine per cent of the database patients were female
less than 50 years, but this group constituted 50% of those
who developed ovarian mettases. Nime patients were less
than 40 years. Ovarian metastases were confirmed surgically
in 17 cases and by CT scan of the pehlis in the other 34
cases 39 were bilateral and 12 unilateral. The ovary was the
sole site of metastases in five cases. In the remaining cases
metasta
were reported in the following
sites: liver, 23
cases; lung, 16 cases; peritoneum 16 cases; lymph nodes, 20
cases, abdominal wall, two cass.
Response to treatment
The response to treatment was evaluated and stratified ac-
cording to primary tumour type. Of the 51 patients sse
in the study, 36 had measurable disease in the ovaries as well
as at extrovarian
sites. The overall response was partial
response in eight patients (22%) and complete response in no
patients. However, a total of 11 patients had a partial re-
sponse at extraovarian sites, and only five of these had a
partial response in the ovaries. One patient had a differential
response characterised by response at an extraovarian site
while the ovarian disease
emained stable, and six patients
responded at extraovarian sites but synchronously developed
new lesions in the ovaries while stfill responding (Table HI).
The duration of response for responders was 2.5 months. The
median survival for the 51 patients was 9 months, and for the
patients who responded to chemotherapy was 20 months.
Interestingly, three women less than 50 years who received
adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric carcinoma relapsed solely
in the ovary, and after surgical resection all remain alive and
well 6, 10 and 28 months after surgery. Two women devel-
oped ovarian metastases while on adjuvant chemotherapy for
colorectal carcinoma: one had an oophorectomy but has
developed recurrent pelvc disease and the other has isolated
ovarian metaa
awaiting surgery.
Response to radiotherapy
Only three patients had pelvic radiotherapy, two preceding
chemotherapy and one after unsuccessful chemotherapy; all
patients responded, two partially and one completely.
Response to surgery
The 17 patients who had surgery had a subsequent disease-
free period oN-28 + months following surgery (Table H).
Surgery was performed at widely differing times in the course
of the patient's disease.

DEsasso
Although there are many reports of ovarian metastases in the
literature,
we
believe
this
is
the
largest
series
which
specifically addresses the value of chemotherapy in these
patients. Ovarian metastases can occur from any primary site
within the gastrointestinal tract, although colorectal followed
by oesophagogastric metastases were the most frequent in
this series. As more active regimens are being evaluated in
metastatic colon and gastric carcinoma, it is imperative to
know if certain disease sites respond more favourably than
others so that patients who are unlikely to benefit are spared
unnecessary treatment. This series shows an overall response
rate of 22% to chemotherapy, which in the setting of meta-
static gastrointestinal malignancies is no lower than would be
expected for some of the individual tumour types with the
most current active regimens. These patients were all treated
in the last 4 years and received what was considered to be the
best available treatment for their tumour type. When
re-
sponse was stratified according to
site of metastases, the
overall response rate in the ovary was 14% (CI 0.047-0.295),
which
is
lower
than
the
31%
extrovarian
sites
(CI
0.163-0.481). Ovarian metastases were surgically confirmed
in only 17 (33%) of the cases.
Another explanation for the differential responses seen in
at least some cases may be the true occurrence of a second
primary in the ovary. In these cases the ovarian tumour
would be unlikely to respond to 5-fluorouracil-based chemo-
therapy. However, as there was no reported family history of
multiple primary cancer syndromes or other cancers,
this
explanation would be likely to account for only a small
number of the total cases. In addition, multiple primaries are
AE Taylor et i
more frequent in patients less than 40 years, and only 9 of
the 51 patients were in this group. It was neither ethical nor
practical to biopsy all the ovarian masses. Radiologically
they were presumed in the context of a proven primary lesion
to be
metastases.
Supporting
this presumption was
the
absence of a significant amount of ascites, seen only in four
patients towards
the end of treatment. Primary ovarian
cancer is frequently assocated with a larg amount of ascites.
In only 30% were large ovarian masses seen on the first CT
scan; the rzmainder developed while patients were on treat-
ment and were observed over a 6 month to 2 year period.
The differential response was especially evident when the
primary site was colorectal and suggests that ovarian meta-
stases from primary colorectal cancer are relatively resistant
to chemotherapy compared with non-ovarian metastases.
Therefore, the ovary may be a sanctuary site analogous to
the
testis in other malignancies. Also suggestive of such
sanctuary sites is the three cases of solitary ovarian relapw in
patients who received adjuvant therapy, although no definite
conclusions
can
be
drawn.
In
particular,
patients
with
primary colorectal cancer had a 40%
response rate (CI
0.19-0.64) at extraovarian sites compared with a 5% (CI
0.001-0.25)
response
rate
in
the
ovary,
although
the
confidence intervals overlap because of the small number of
patients (Table IV). Patients with metastatic gastrointestinal
tumours cannot be cured, but there is now evidence that
patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma
have an improved survival with palliation of symptoms if
they receive chemotherapy (Poon et al., 1989; Nordic Gastro-
intestinal Tumour Adjuvant Therapy Group, 1993). If palli-
ation of symptoms at extrovarian sites can be achieved by
chemotherapy, then large ovarian metastases from a colorec-
tal primary may remain a significant source of morbidity, as
this series suggests that they respond minimally to chemo-
therapy. Pathological studies have demonstrated involvement
of the ovary in 3-8% of colorectal cancer patients (Abrams
et al., 1950; Wheelock and Putong, 1959). Prospective studies
in which prophylactic oophorectomy has been performed in
patients with colorectal cancer show the incidence of ovarian
involvement to be between 7.4% and 11.3% (MacKeigan and
Ferguson, 1979; Holtz and Hart, 1982). Microscopic disease
has been reported in 3% of patients (MacKeigan and Fer-
guson, 1979). Several authors have advocated prophylactic
oophorectomy for women with colorectal cancer (Burt, 1951;
Barr et al., 1962; Antonaides et al., 1977; MacKeigan and
Ferguson,
1979; Graffner et
al.,
1983) but this has not
become accepted standard practice. The argument against
prophylactic oophorectomy is the lack of evidence showing a
survival benefit in any of the studies performed. A retrospec-
tive study from the Mayo Clinic (Ballantyne et al., 1985)
reviewed 571 women who underwent curative resection of
colon cancer. The overall
5 year survival was 78%

oophorectomised women and 73% for others, a difference of
5%, but the sample size was not large enough to reach
staisical signifi. This survival difference is silar to
the reported frequency of ovarian metastases associated with
colon cancer. However, the real issue is not about increasing
overall survival as the ovary is unlikely to be the only site of
metastatic disease in the majority of patients with metastatic
gastrointestinal malignancies. What is more crucial is that,
should ovarian metastases occur, then they are potentially
the source of significant morbidity and, unlike disease at
other metastatic sites, this report demonstrates that they are
less responsive
to chemotherapy.
This study shows that
premenopausal women have a proportionally higher inci-
dence of ovarian metastases. As adjuvant chemotherapy has
been shown to be worthwhile in colorectal cancer, a potential
sanctuary site for microscopic tumour is of concern. Pro-
phylactic oophorectomy with its attendant complications and
lack of survival benefit cannot be justified in these women.
However, it would be a relatively simple matter to follow
such women by regular transvaginal ultrasonography, especi-
ally in the premenopausal group. Early surgical resection of
ovarian metastases may avoid the situation where extra-
ovarian metastases respond to chemotherapy but the patient
continues to have an enlarging symptomatic pelvic mass
resistant to chemotherapy.
For patients who develop ovarian metastases subsequent
to their primary surgery, a second operation is not often
contemplated because of the presence of concurrent disease
at other sites or because of unfitness for surgery. The small
number of patients in this report who had surgery had
several months disease free, which must be considered worth-
while
palliation, even though they subsequently died of
disease at other sites. Patients with widespread metastases
who achieve a good response to chemotherapy at extra-
ovarian sites but have unresponsive ovarian metastases caus-
ing symptoms or with impending symptoms should be con-
sidered potential candidates for palliative surgical resection
or palliative radiotherapy as the few patients treated with
radiotherapy all responded.

Complications of Regional Anesthesia
For Ophthalmic Surgery
Kathryn E. McGoldrick, M.D.a
Department ofAnesthesiology, Yale University School ofMedicine
New Haven, Connecticut
(Submitted July 12, 1993; accepted December 13, 1993)
Ocular regional anesthesia can be accomplished with either a peribulbar or
retrobulbar approach. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Complications
can be vision-treatening or life-threatening. Positioning the eye in neutral gaze
when retrobulbar block is executed and using a needle no longer than 31 mm
are effective strategies to reduce the incidence of serious complications.
Orbital injection of local anesthetics (cocaine) was first performed in 1884 for
enucleation of the globe [1]. However, it was not until the 1930's, when the less toxic pro-
caine and, later, the amide anesthetics became available, that orbital block was commonly
used for ophthalmic surgery. Atkinson's 1936 paper [2] popularized a technique that
became firmly entrenched as the traditional retrobulbar block. With this approach, a dull
needle was inserted into the muscle cone while the globe was elevated and adducted (i.e.,
gazing superonasally). Moreover, a separate facial nerve block is necessary in conjunc-
tion with retrobulbar block to achieve akinesia of the eyelids. A variety of approaches can
be used to block the facial nerve, either proximally or distally, to its exit point from the
skull through the stylomastoid foramen. Moving distally to proximally to the foramen,
the techniques include the van Lint, Atkinson, O'Brien, and Nadbath-Rehman methods.
Each has advantages and disadvantages that will be discussed below.
A partial list of complications [3-13] associated with retrobulbar block includes
retrobulbar hemorrhage, stimulation of the oculocardiac reflex arc, puncture of the globe
producing retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage, intraocular injection, optic nerve
penetration, central retinal artery occlusion, intravenous or intra-arterial injection, and
brain stem anesthesia.
Retrobulbar hemorrhage occurs as often as 1 to 3% of the time after retrobulbar
injection [14]. Diagnostic features include proptosis (with hardness of the globe), chemo-
sis, and the eventual appearance of subconjunctival blood. Intraocular pressure can
increase dramatically after a major bleed and should be monitored with tonometry by the
ophthalmologist. In addition, central retinal artery pulsations must be monitored carefully
by the ophthalmologist to rule out retinal artery occlusion. If flow is impeded, a lateral
canthotomy [15] or anterior chamber paracentesis will be necessary. Moreover, since
blood extravasation from the muscle cone may trigger the oculocardiac reflex several
hours after performance of the retrobulbar block, appropriate electrocardiographic moni-
toring is indicated.
Since 1980, several literature reports documented serious CNSb depression following
retrobulbar block. There is a continuum of sequelae, depending on the amount of drug
that gains entrance to the CNS, and the specific area to which the drug spreads [16]. The
protean CNS signs may include violent shivering [17], contralateral amaurosis,
loss of
consciousness, apnea, and hemiplegia, paraplegia, quadriplegia, or hyperreflexia.
Blockade of the eighth to twelfth cranial nerves will result in deafness, vertigo, vagolysis,

dysphagia, aphasia, and loss of neck muscle power. Although these signs may be present
in various combinations, once it is apparent that the local anesthetic has spread to the
CNS, the anesthesiologist must immediately be prepared to provide cardiopulmonary
resuscitation if necessary. When properly treated, these patients quickly recover com-
pletely. However, delay in diagnosing and treating the condition can result in death.
Much is now known about prevention of brain stem anesthesia. Attention has
focused on ocular position when regional blockade of the eye is performed and on the
length and type of needle selected. In 1981, Unsold et al. [18] pointed out the hazard of
the traditional Atkinson position of superonasal gaze during inferotemporal needle place-
ment for retrobulbar block. This position places the optic nerve in closer proximity to the
advancing needle, where the needle tip can pierce the meningeal sheath surrounding the
optic nerve, allowing local anesthetics to spread throughout the CNS. With the globe in
primary gaze, or looking inferonasally [19], the optic nerve sheath is less vulnerable to
needle penetration. Moreover, avoidance of deep penetration of the orbit is important to
prevent this and other serious complications, including perforation of the globe. Even in
the absence of penetration of the optic nerve sheath, central spread of local anesthetic
from deep orbital injection may be a rare complication [20]. Hence, the maximal needle
length currently recommended for retrobulbar block is 31 mm (1.25 inches) [21].
Moreover, recent studies have found that serious injury is greater with the use of larger,
dull needles than with fine, disposable ones [22].
Peribulbar block is considered by many to be easier, safer, and less painful than
retrobulbar block, because the muscle cone is not entered and the need for facial nerve
block is eliminated. Because the anesthetic is deposited outside the muscle cone and then
must diffuse to target areas, the potential for intraocular or intradural injection is mini-
mized, and the potential for intraconal hemorrhage and direct nerve injury is essentially
avoided. However, peribulbar block typically has a higher failure rate and a longer onset
time than retrobulbar block, unless the onset is accelerated by adding sodium bicarbonate
to the anesthetic mixture [23]. Additionally, the larger volume of anesthetic deposited in
the orbit produces increased forward pressure on the eyeball, which some surgeons find
objectionable. Reported complications have included peribulbar hemorrhage and perfora-
tion of the globe.
In summary, it is imperative to understand that complications from ocular regional
anesthesia can be both vision-threatening and life-threatening.
