Summary
Data from the Cancer Registries of the Swiss Cantons of Vaud and Neuchatel were analysed to
examine possible associations between skin cancers (including basal cell carcinoma, BCC), non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLL). Between 1974 and 1993, 1767 cases of NHL,
351 of CLL, 1678 of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), 4131 of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and
10 575 of BCC were registered, and contributed to a total of 120 103 person -years at risk. Following NHL, 36
cases of SCC were registered compared with 5.1 expected, corresponding to a standardised incidence ratio
(SIR) of 7.0 (95% confidence interval, CI, 4.9-9.7); 37 cases of BCC were observed compared with 10.2
expected (SIR = 3.6; 95% CI 2.6-5.0). Following CLL, nine cases of SCC were observed compared with 1.8
expected (SIR=5.0; 95% CI 2.3-9.5) and nine cases of BCC were observed compared with 3.3 expected
(SIR = 2.7; 95% CI
1.2- 5.2). After SCC, 23 cases at NHL were observed compared with 9.0 expected
(SIR=2.6; 95% CI 1.6-3.8); after BCC, 43 cases of NHL were registered compared with 22.5 expected
(SIR= 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6); and after CMM, four cases of NHL were observed compared with 2.0 expected
(SIR=2.0). No significant excess of CLL was recorded following skin cancer, but the absolute numbers were
small and the SIR was above unity. The findings of this study, conducted in populations with a high level of
ascertainment and registration of skin cancers, confirm an excess of skin cancers including BCC, following
NHL and CLL, and an excess of NHL following skin cancers. This may be related to shared aetiological
factors such as U.V. radiation and associated immunosuppression. Individual-based data on the relationship
between U.V. exposure and lymphoid neoplasms are needed to clarify the issue.

The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and of
the
related
chronic
lymphocytic
leukaemias
(CLL)
has
substantially increased over the last few decades in most
areas of the world (Devesa and Fears,
1992; Hartge and
Devesa, 1992; Carli et al., 1994; Hartge et al., 1994; Levi et
al.,
1995a; Hjalgrim
et
al.,
1996). A proportion of this
increase is due to improved diagnosis and certification, but
this alone cannot adequately explain such a systematic and
substantial rise.
Immunodepression has been related to lymphomas, and an
immunodepressant effect of U.V. radiation has been reported
in
experimental
conditions
(Hartge
and
Devesa,
1992;
Cartwright
et
al.,
1994; Doll,
1996). Furthermore,
a few
studies from the Nordic countries, North America and The
Netherlands have reported excess incidence of melanoma and
non-melanomatous skin cancers following NHL or CLL, and
of NHL or CLL following skin cancer (Travis et al., 1992,
1993; Adami
et
al.,
1995; Hall
et
al.,
1995;
Frisch and
Melbye,
1995).
The
evidence,
however,
is
not
totally
consistent
as
no
excess
of NHL
was
observed
after
melanoma in Denmark (Swerdlow et al., 1995). In addition,
ecological studies on populations in the UK (Bentham, 1996)
and on a worldwide scale (McMichael and Giles, 1996), but
not within
the United
States
(Hartge
et
al.,
1996),
are
suggestive of a shared influence of U.V. exposure (on a
population level) on NHL and skin neoplasms.
In a systematic analysis of multiple primary cancers in
Vaud, Switzerland, between 1974 and 1989 (Levi et al., 1993),
an excess of non-melanomatous skin cancer was observed
after NHL and
leukaemias
in both
sexes. We
decided,
therefore,
to update
the
analysis with
specific
focus on
various histotypes of skin cancer and lymphoid neoplasms.

This was made possible by specific attention to identification
and
registration
of
various
histotypes
of
skin
cancer,
including
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(SCC),
basal
cell
carcinoma
(BCC)
and
cutaneous
malignant
melanoma
(CMM) (Levi et al., 1995b).
Materials and methods
The present analysis is based on the Vaud and Neuchatel
Cancer Registries files, which include information concerning
incident
cases
of malignant neoplasms
in
these
cantons
(whose populations,
according
to
the
1990
census,
were
about 600 000 and 160 000 respectively; Levi et al.,
1992;
Pellaux et al., 1992).
Notification is based on a voluntary agreement between
the recording medical institutions of the cantons and the
registries. All hospitals, pathological laboratories and most
practitioners are asked to report all new or past cases of
cancer.
Information collected by the registries includes general
demographic
characteristics
of
the
patient
(age,
sex,
municipality
of residence),
site,
histological
type
of the
tumour, according to the standard International Classifica-
tion of Diseases for Oncology (WHO,
1976), and time of
diagnostic confirmation.
Passive and
active follow-up
is
carried
out and each
subsequent
item
of
information
concerning
an
already
registered
case
is
used
to
complete
the
record
of
the
patient. Information obtained from the death certificate is
added to the morbidity file. Cases known only through the
death
certificate
('death
certificate
only'
cases,
DCO)
contribute less than 5% of the average number of new cases
registered per year.
The registries are tumour based, and multiple primaries
occurring
in
the
same
patient
are
registered
separately
whenever
morphologically
different
(according
to
the
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and skin cancers
F Levi et al
pathological report) or occurring at different anatomical sites
(defined at the third-digit level of the ICD-O topographical
code; WHO, 1976). As a rule, multiple non-melanomatous
skin
tumours
(either
synchronous
or metachronous)
are
classified by the site of the first recognised tumour of the
same morphological type.
For the present study, skin cancer cases were grouped into
the following three morphological categories: (1) basal cell
(ICD-O M: 8090-3, 8095-6); (2) squamous cell (ICD-O M:
8050-2, 8070-6, 8094, 8560); and (3) malignant melanoma
(ICD-O M: 8720-90, excluding 8742.2, lentigo maligna, but
including 8742.3, lentigo maligna melanoma). Other rare skin
cancers and, in particular, cancers arising from skin of genital
organs (ICD-O T: 184, 187) were excluded from the present
report. With respect to lymphoid neoplasms, we considered
all cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (ICD-O M: 9590-649,
9690-709, 9740-59) and chronic lymphoid leukaemia (ICD-O
M: 9823) registered from 1974 to 1993 in the populations of
the
Swiss
cantons
of Vaud
and
Neuchatel.
All
cases
considered in the present series were histologically verified.
Calculation of expected numbers was based on sex-, age-
and calendar year-specific incidence rates multiplied by the
observed number of person-years at risk. The end of the
follow-up
was
determined
by
a
second
primary,
death,
emigration or the end of the study period at 31 December
1994.
The
significance
of
the
observed/expected
ratios
(standardised incidence ratio, SIR) was based on the Poisson
distribution applied to the observed numbers (Breslow and
Day, 1987).

Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and skin cancers
F Levi et al
was appreciably, although not significantly, larger in women
(SIR = 9.2) than in men (SIR = 5.0), but similar in strata of
duration of follow-up. When two separate age groups were
considered, risk was higher below age 75 (SIR= 16.5; 95% CI
9.2-27.2) than at age 75 or over (SIR=5.0; 95% CI 3.1-
7.6). A total of 37 cases of BCCs were observed compared
with 10.2 expected, corresponding to a SIR of 3.6 (95% CI
2.6-5.0). Significant heterogeneity was only observed across
the two separate strata of age at diagnosis considered, the
SIR being 6.7 below age 75 and 2.2 at age 75 or over. With
reference
to
all
skin
cancers,
74
cases
were
observed
compared with 16.6 expected (SIR=4.5, 95% CI 3.5-5.6).
Following
CLL,
nine
cases
of SCC
were
observed
compared with
1.8 expected (SIR= 5.0; 95% CI 2.3-9.5),
nine cases of BCC compared with 3.3 expected (SIR=2.7;
95% CI 1.2-5.2) and 19 cases of all skin cancers combined
compared with 5.5 expected (SIR=3.5; 95% CI 2.1-5.4).
The SIR was higher for men (5.1) than for women (0.8), after
shorter duration of follow-up (SIR = 4.8; <5 years vs 1.4>5
years), and for the younger age group (SIR= 8.7; <75 years
vs
2.4 > 75
years),
although
these
differences
were
not
significant.
Corresponding
information
on
lymphoid
neoplasms
following major histotypes of skin cancer is shown in Table
III. After SCC, 23 cases of NHL were observed compared
with 9.0 expected (SIR=2.6; 95% CI 1.6-3.8).
No heterogeneity was observed between men and women,
across age groups or durations of follow-up. Only four cases
of CLL were observed compared with 2.7 expected and, thus,
no excess risk emerged for SCC.
A total of 43 cases of NHL were observed after BCC
compared with 22.5 expected, corresponding to a SIR of 1.9
(95% CI 1.4-2.6). With the exception of age at diagnosis, no
appreciable heterogeneity was observed across strata of sex or
durations of follow-up. After SCC, four cases of CLL were
observed compared with 2.7 expected (SIR= 1.5; 95% CI
0.4 -3.8), whereas no appreciable CLL excess was observed
after BCC (SIR= 1.1; 95% CI 0.4-2.2). After CMM, four
cases of NHL were observed (SIR = 2.0) and one case of CLL
(SIR= 1.9). None of these estimates was significant.
Discussion
The findings of this study, conducted in populations with
high standards of ascertainment, diagnosis and certification
of skin cancer (Levi et al., 1995b), confirm that there is an
excess of skin cancers (including BCC) following lymphoid
neoplasms (NHL and CLL) and an excess of NHL following
skin cancer. The relationship was observed for both SCC and
BCC, but was somewhat stronger for SCC. A consistent
pattern of risk was observed with CMM, too, but the data
were too scanty for any significant result. The lower risk of
skin cancer following CLL may be due to the low number of
cases, or may indicate a reduced association compared with
that observed with NHL.
Thus, the main contribution of this study is in showing that
not only SCC and CMM, but also BCC (which is seldom
registered in cancer registration schemes), is related to NHL
and CLL. The associations were significant and consistent for
BCC although somewhat less strong than for SCC.
Assuming that the underlying mechanism of the observed
relationship between incidence of skin cancer and lymphoid
neoplasms is U.V. radiation - and the consequent immuno-
supression of lymphoid neoplasms (Cartwright et al., 1994;
Hartge and Devesa, 1992; Doll, 1996) - this may reflect a
differential role of U.V. exposure on the incidence of SCC and
BCC. Data from the same population (Franceschi et al., 1996)
indicated
that
both
histotypes
were
more
common
in
frequently sun-exposed areas in both
sexes, although the
excess was greater for SCC. Other

Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and skin cancers
F Levi et al
1850
also showed a stronger association between NHL and SCC
(with SIR of the order of 5) than for CMM (SIR around or
below 2). The latter estimate was also consistent with that of a
cohort of more than 6171 cases of NHL collected in various
areas of North America and Europe (Travis et al., 1993).
A common aetiological correlate, U.V. exposure or other
factors causing immunosuppression (Cartwright et al., 1994;
Sasieni and Bataille, 1995), appears, therefore, to be a likely
explanation
of
the
association
observed.
This
is
also
consistent with certain descriptive features of skin neoplasms
and lymphomas, including their upward trends over the last
few decades in most developed countries (Devesa and Fears,
1992; Hartge and Devesa, 1992; Carli et al., 1994; Levi et al.,
1995a,b; Hjalgrim et al., 1996) and geographic correlational
studies in the UK (Bentham, 1996; McMichael and Giles,
1996),
although
not
in
the US
(Hartge
et
al.,
1996).
Moreover, there is a lack of individual-based information
on any
potential
relationship between sun - and other
sources
of U.V.
exposure - and
the
risk of lymphoid
neoplasms. Before any such data are available, any inference
on aetiological correlates should be considered speculative.
Increased
surveillance and diagnosis following another
neoplasm should also be considered. Although this could be a
reasonable interpretation for at least part of the skin cancer
excess following lymphoma, it is unlikely that a past history
of SCC
or BCC
would
materially
modify
subsequent
ascertainment
and
diagnosis
of lymphomas
and
CLL.
Furthermore, no systematic excess of any cancer sites was
observed: following skin melanoma the SIR for any site was
1.1 for men and 0.8 for women; following non-melanomas
1.0 for both; and following lymphomas 1.3 for men and 1.0
for women (Levi et al., 1993).
The absence of any clear pattern of risk with increasing
time after diagnosis of the first neoplasm is also incompatible
with a major role of ascertainment or diagnostic bias. Among
the other advantages of this study are its population basis,
the inclusion of various histotypes of skin cancer, which
should render any estimate relatively free from selection bias,
and the complete histological confirmation of the various
types of neoplasms considered.
In conclusion, therefore, this study on a population that
was particularly well surveyed for skin cancers (Levi et al.,
1995b) confirms the presence of an association between SCC,
NHL and, although less strongly, CLL. For the first time,
these data also demonstrated an association between BCC,
NHL and CLL, supporting the hypothesis that common
aetiological
factors
are
a
determinant
of the
increased
incidence of various types of skin and lymphoid neoplasms.
The accumulating evidence on the issue has relevance to
prevention

'Tumour volume'
Sir
We were interested to read the paper on survival after resection
of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in relation to 'tumour
volume' by Jefferson et al (1996).
By multiplying together the three dimensions of each tumour,
the authors have assumed that the carcinomas are box shaped. The
accuracy of this assumption was not validated. In a study of 54
resected lung cancers (Binks et al, 1996), we found that the most
appropriate measures of tumour volume were to assume that the
tumours were ellipsoidal or boxes. These measurements compared
well with our gold standard methods (R = 0.887 and R = 0.910
respectively) of sequential 1-mm or 1-cm slices, for which the
tumour area was measured and the volume derived from the sum
of the areas. In contrast, measurement of the maximum dimension
and assuming a spherical shape grossly overestimated the volume
of some tumours (R = 0.632).
Although we expected ellipsoidal measurements to be more
accurate than boxes, this was not the case. We support the authors
statement that tumour volume is a useful piece of information that
is
easily
collected, but three dimensions
should always be
measured for solid tumours.

High-dose 5-fluorouracil infusional therapy is associated
with hyperammonaemia, lactic acidosis and
encephalopathy
Sir
Keywords: high-dose 5-fluorouracil; encephalopathy
Recently, weekly 24-h infusion of high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
and folinic acid has become a popular regimen (Ardalan et al,
1991; Aranda et al, 1995; Leichman et al, 1995). Although unusu-
ally high doses, up to 2600 mg mi-2 per week of 5-FU and 500 mg
m-2 per week of folinic acid, were administered, the toxicities of
myelosuppression and mucositis were surprisingly low. In our
institution, chemotherapeutic protocols incorporating 24-h infu-
sion of high-dose 5-FU (2600 mg m-2 per week) and leucovorin
(300 mg m-2 per week) (HDFL) have been used in treatment of
various cancers, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, breast
cancer, urological cancer, and head and neck cancer (Yeh et al,
1994a). Our experience of the treatment-related
toxicities of
HDFL has largely been in keeping with those reported by Ardalan
et al (1991), except an unusual encephalopathy which first came to
our attention in 1992 (Yeh et al, 1994b). Since then, we have
encountered a spectrum of encephalopathy, including disorienta-
tion, confusion,
agitation,
neurosensory
hearing
impairment,
seizure, stupor and deep coma, associated with the use of HDFL
regimens. This encephalopathy was unique in that its development
and severity were closely related to the emergence of hyperam-
monaemia and lactic acidosis. Thus, it should be distinguished
from other 5-FU-associated toxicities previously reported.
Among 280 patients who had received HDFL in our institution
between
1991
and
1995,
16 (5.7%) developed HDFL-related
encephalopathy. The diagnostic criteria included: (1) development
of encephalopathy during or shortly after completion of HDFL
administration; (2) exclusion of other metabolic or physical factors
that may have an effect on the consciousness level, such as hyper-
glycaemia, hypoglycaemia, azotaemia, hepatic failure, electrolyte
imbalance, sepsis and central nervous system involvement of
cancers; and (3) exclusion of a drug effect by concomitant medica-
tions. The incidence of this complication was highest in gastric
cancer (12.1%), followed by breast cancer (4.3%) and colorectal
cancer (2.4%). Thirteen (81.3%) of 16 patients had severe symptoms
of stupor or coma; in two patients these symptoms were combined
with seizure. Severe (grade III-IV) nausea and vomiting and a
Kussmaul's respiration were noted in 15 (93.8%) and 16 (100%)
patients respectively during the attack of encephalopathy. The
median time of onset of encephalopathy was 195Jp (range 10-30 h
from the start of HDFL infusion, and the m
an duration of
encephalopathy between discontinuation of HD1_Land complete
recovery was 15 h (range 3-72 h). All patients recovered completely,
except one who developed a bilateral neurosensory hearing impair-
ment that recovered partially. Electroencephalogram (EEG) exami-
nations of eight patients revealed diffuse cortical dysfunction with
diffuse slow waves or diffuse intermittent theta waves, suggesting
metabolic or toxic encephalopathy. Since our first experience of this
complication in 1992 (Yeh et al, 1994b), arterial blood gas, plasma
ammonia and plasma lactic acid were routinely examined in the
patients who had developed encephalopathy. Hyperammonaemia
(149 to >500 ,umol 1-', median 345) (reference level 19-43 ,umol 1-',
checked by ammonia-selective electrode), lactic acidosis (4.0 to > 12
mg dl-', median 9.2) (reference level 0.3-1.3 mg dl-') and hypo-
capnia (pCO2 15-30.1 mmHg, median 18.6) (reference level 35-45
mmHg) were found to parallel the development of encephalopathy.

These abnormalities were not detected in patients who also received
HDFL treatment but did not develop encephalopathy (data not
shown). Further examination of a series of biochemical parameters
revealed that the serum triglyceride level (43.2 Â± 13.7 mg dl-') (refer-
ence level 50-130 mg dl-') of the 16 patients was significantly lower
than that (126.4 Â± 70.0 mg dl-') of the patients who did not develop
encephalopathy (P < 0.001 using Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
Although direct evidence is lacking, we have formulated a
hypothesis which appears to be the best fit for this scenario.
Ammonia is the 'end' product of 5-FU. Following high-dose 5-
FU administration, a large amount of ammonia is rapidly accumu-
lated and should normally be cleared by the ATP-dependent urea
cycle. In the case of HDFL treatment, a large amount of fluoroac-
etate, the 'intermediate' product of 5-FU, directly inhibits the
ATP-producing Kreb's cycle (Koenig et al, 1970; Mayes et al,
1993) and results in lactic acidosis and the impairment of the ATP-
dependent urea cycle. Hypotriglyceridaemia impairs the ATP-
producing lipolysis (5-oxidation) which should normally salvage
the ATP-deficiency state caused by an impaired Kreb's cycle. This
further jeopardizes the ATP-dependent urea cycle. The end result
is a transient hyperammonaemia state with encephalopathy.
It is necessary to consider differential diagnosis with other 5-
FU-related toxicities. Firstly, the familial deficiency of dihydropy-
rimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the primary inactivating enzyme of
5-FU, should be ruled out. This situation usually results in severe
myelosuppression and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and may be asso-
ciated with a low level of catabolic products, including ammonia
(Tuchman et al, 1985; Diasio et al, 1988; Harris et al, 1991). The fact
that none of our patients had developed significant myelosuppression
or GI toxicities and that all of them had had hyperammonaemia did
not favour the possibility of a DPD- deficiency state. A recent report
described a single patient with DPD deficiency who presented with
only mild GI and marrow toxicity (Takimoto et al, 1996). However,
comparing this case with the other 17 cases of classical DPD defi-
ciency reported in the literature (Tuchman et al, 1985; Diasio et al,
1988; Harris et al, 1991; Fleming et al, 1993; Houyau et al, 1993; Lu
et al, 1993; Lyss et al, 1993), we suggest that this patient might actu-
ally have developed a syndrome similar to that reported in this letter.
Secondly, high 5-FU blood concentrations due to hepatic dysfunction
(Floyd et al, 1982) or DPD deficiency plus renal failure (Stephan et
al, 1995) should also be considered. It was apparent that none of our
patients had hepatic or renal dysfunction. Finally, malnutrition and its
associated thiamine deficiency may contribute to this syndrome. 5-
FU exacerbates the pre-existing thiamine deficiency by blocking the
conversion of thiamine to active thiamine pyrophosphate (Basu et al,
1974; Soukop et al, 1978). It should be possible to reverse this condi-
tion using thiamine supplement (Aksoy et al, 1980). Thiamine
supplement had been tried with several of our patients; however,
none of them responded to this treatment (data not shown).
We suggest that (1) encephalopathy is an important complica-
tion of HDFL treatment; (2) HDFL-related encephalopathy is asso-
ciated with unique biochemical changes of hyperammonaemia,
lactic acidosis and hypocapnia; and (3) patients with hypotriglyc-
eridaemia are relatively contraindicated for HDFL treatment.

Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the head and neck
region: clinicopathological correlation in 25 cases

Departments of 'Clinical Oncology, 2Pathology, 3Medical Oncology and 4Surgery, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK
Summary Extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMP) of head and neck are rare tumours. Between 1972 and 1993, 25 cases of EMP of head
and neck were seen at our institute. The clinical and pathological features and response to treatment are presented. At initial presentation, 23
(92%) patients presented with disease confined to a single extramedullary site only and two patients had in addition clinical involvement of
cervical lymph nodes. All except these two patients received radiotherapy to the primary site only as initial treatment. Initial primary control of
local disease was obtained in 16 of 24 (67%) patients treated with radical intent. With salvage treatment of further radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy, local disease control was achieved in 21 of 24 (88%) patients. One patient was treated with palliative intent. Conversion to
multiple myeloma was seen in two patients (8%). Pathologically, the tumours were classified into low, intermediate and high grade, which
correlated closely with outcome. This classification has been used for the first time in extramedullary plasmacytomas and is based on the
multiple myeloma grading criteria devised by Bartl et al (1987). Fifteen of eighteen (83%) low-grade tumours and only one of six (17%)
intermediate- and high-grade tumours were locally controlled after primary radiotherapy. This is statistically significant for local control (P=
0.0019) but not for overall survival (P= 0.12). The median survival and 5-year overall survival is 68 months and 58.9% respectively. We
recommend consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with higher grade disease.
Keywords: plasmacytoma; extramedullary plasmacytoma; head and neck; grading; radiotherapy
Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP)
is a rare tumour which
accounts for less than 1-2% of all plasma cell neoplasms, and any
extra medullary organ or tissue may be involved. Eighty per cent of
these tumours originate in the head and neck region, commonly in
subepithelial
tissues of the upper
air passages including the
paranasal sinuses (Wiltshaw, 1976). EMP patients characteristically
present with localized disease and the incidence of lymph node
involvement is 10-20%. Progression to multiple myeloma is signif-
icantly lower than that seen in solitary plasmacytoma of bone. The
rarity of this tumour and its long natural history make determination
of prognostic factors difficult. Most reports in the literature are of
single cases, although a few series include up to 20 cases. Radiation
therapy (XRT) is generally accepted as the treatment of choice. The
role of chemotherapy for localized tumour is not well defined.
This paper is a review of 25 cases of EMP of the head and neck
region seen at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK, over a 22-year
period. The principal objectives are to (1) elucidate prognostic
factors from pathological review, (2) define any dose-response rela-
tionship of radiation therapy, (3) evaluate the role of chemotherapy
as an adjuvant with respect to its effect as salvage treatment and (4)
determine other prognostic factors from following the natural
history of the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
There were 25 cases of EMP of the head and neck region seen in
the 22-year period between 1972 and 1993 at the Christie Hospital.

The patients were diagnosed as having an EMP if they met the
following
criteria:
(1)
a biopsy-proven
plasma
cell
tumour
involving a single extramedullary site with or without lymph node
involvement, (2) a bone marrow biopsy showing less than 5%
plasma cells and (3) normal skeletal survey. The presence of a
monoclonal band on serum protein electrophoresis or the presence
of Bence Jones protein in urine did not exclude patients from this
analysis. Bone destruction in conjunction with the extramedullary
mass did not exclude a patient from being classified as having
EMP, provided that the bony involvement was in direct continuity
with the tumour mass.
The median age of the patients was 68 years (range 27-84
years) and there was a strong male preponderance (M/F 23:2).
Nearly two-thirds presented with disease in the nasal cavity,
sinuses or nasopharynx (Table 1). Two patients (8%) had clinical
involvement of a cervical lymph node at presentation. One patient
(4%) had an IgA monoclonal band on serum protein elec-
trophoresis and three patients (12%) showed evidence of adjacent
bony destruction at the time of diagnosis. The median follow-up
for all patients was 73 months (range 2-180 months).
Histological technique
The histological sections of each case were reviewed. Paraffin
sections were cut at 4 gm when tissue blocks were available; other-
wise unstained sections sent by laboratories in the referring hospi-
tals were used. All cases were stained with haematoxylin and eosin
(H and E). When the H and E appearances were suggestive of
amyloid deposition, a Congo red stain was performed. Immuno-
histochemistry was performed using a standard streptavidin-
peroxidase complex technique with diaminobenzidine chromogen
substrate. All cases were examined immunohistochemically for
kappa and lambda light chains. When additional sections were

available, immunohistochemistry for IgA, IgG and IgM was also
carried out (five cases). All antibodies were obtained from Dako,
and pretreatment was 4.5 min trypsin digestion in all cases. Positive
and negative controls were employed for all special stains.
Histological grading
The diagnosis of plasmacytoma required areas with closely packed
sheets consisting entirely of plasma cells to the exclusion of other
cell types. Cases were graded according to the histological grading
criteria devised by Bartl et al (1987) for multiple myeloma (MM).
This involves a three-tiered grading system which is summarized
as follows:
Grade
1 (low grade). Figure
1 shows a marschalko type in
which the plasma cells are indistinguishable from normal cells,
although mitotic figures can be seen (also includes the small-
cell type).
Grade 2 (intermediate grade). Figure 2 shows the asynchronous
type in which there is marked discrepancy of maturation between
nucleus and cytoplasm. At least 50% of the cells have enlarged
nuclei with prominent nucleoli while the abundant basophilic
cytoplasm and perinuclear hof are maintained.
Grade 3 (high grade). Figure 3 shows a plasmablastic type with
large
nuclei
and
very
prominent
centrally
located
nucleoli.
Cytoplasm is confined to a fairly narrow rim. Perinuclear hof are
inconspicuous or absent.

Management
Following biopsy confirmation and myeloma screening, cases
were managed with primary XRT alone. All cases treated with
radical intent were treated with megavoltage photon therapy. The
volume of treatment field included the primary site only. No
attempts were made to electively treat the cervical lymph nodes. A
patient with primary disease in tonsil and neck node was treated
with a large field encompassing primary disease and cervical
lymph node. One patient refused treatment for a period of 2 years
but later agreed to palliative treatment after becoming sympto-
matic. Over the period of 22 years, a variety of doses were admin-
istered, the commonest being 35-45 Gy in 3 weeks with five
fractions per week.
RESULTS
Pathology
Details of treatment, histological review and outcome are shown in

initial biopsy (17 Marschalko type; one small-cell type). In five
patients (20%), the initial tumour was grade 2 (asynchronous type)

and in one (4%) it was grade 3 (plasmablastic). The plasmablastic
tumour was leucocyte common antigen and CD20 negative. In one
case (4%), the tumour grade varied between different areas and
had a dual low-grade (Marschalko) and intermediate-grade (asyn-
chronous) appearance. Although most cases were composed of
sheets of neoplastic plasma cells, additional histological patterns
were sometimes noted. A prominent pseudoangiomatoid appear-
ance was seen in five cases (four low grade, one intermediate
grade) (Figure 4). Two low-grade tumours had focal areas in which
the neoplastic plasma cells had acquired a spindle cell morphology
and in one of these there was even a vague storiform pattern as a
result of stromal fibrosis (Figure 5). Although mitotic figures were
numerous in the high-grade tumour, we also encountered mitotic
activity in cases with a low-grade morphology and, in one of these,
the mitotic count reached 20 per 10 high-power fields (Leitz
Dialux EB microscope using x 40 objective).
Two grade 1 tumours (8%) had abundant stromal amyloid and in
one of these there was an associated multinucleate giant cell reac-
tion. One tumour exhibited bone formation in the stroma. Sixteen
cases (64%) showed kappa light chain restriction, seven (28%)
showed lambda restriction, and in two cases (8%) immunostaining
for light chains was equivocal. Of the five cases (20%) for which
immunohistochemistry for immunoglobulins was performed, clon-
ality for IgG (two cases) or IgA (one case) was demonstrated. In
the other two cases, IgG, IgA and IgM were negative.
Treatment and outcome
The primary tumour was initially controlled in 16 of 24 patients
(67%) treated with radical intent. Two of them were salvaged with
further XRT after local recurrence developed at 60 and 70 months.
One patient had nodal recurrence at 3 months outside the treatment

field and received XRT to the neck. All three reirradiated patients
achieved local and nodal control. Thus, 19 of 24 patients (79%)
were controlled with radiotherapy alone. One patient with local
recurrence was salvaged by high-dose chemotherapy with periph-
eral blood stem cell rescue, while one patient had salvage surgery.
Both remain in remission giving an overall rate of local control of
88% (21 of 24). One patient was treated with palliative intent.
All the unsalvagable failures (three patients) had a trial of
chemotherapy with melphalan and prednisolone. The three (13%)
radically treated relapse patients and the patient treated with
palliative intent died with uncontrolled primary disease. In total,
10 patients (40%) died of unrelated causes. The median survival
and 5-year overall survival was 68 months and 58.9% respectively.
Two of the three
patients having adjacent bony destruction
recurred locally. There was no documented serious morbidity,
including those patients who underwent retreatment.
The correlation with histological grade is shown in Table 3. For
low-grade tumours, initial local control was achieved in 83% (15
of 18) patients. One of them was salvaged with further XRT giving
local control in 16 of 18 patients (89%). However, the patient with
recurrent low-grade tumour went on to develop disseminated bone
disease/myeloma at 120 months. The two remaining recurrent
patients were treated with melphalan and prednisolone chemo-
therapy as disease extent precluded salvage by surgery. Both of
them died with uncontrolled local disease.
Six patients were radically treated in the intermediate- and high-
grade tumour group, and only one patient achieved initial local
control with XRT. Three of the five were salvaged with further
treatment. The patient with combined low- and intermediate-grade
tumour had nodal recurrence and was treated with further XRT. He
developed disseminated bone disease - myeloma at 6 months after
Figure 5 Vague storiform pattern in a plasmacytoma
primary XRT and is alive with control of primary and nodal
disease. One of the intermediate-grade patients received palliative
XRT. It is interesting to note that his initial tumour from the nasal
cavity was low grade but subsequent nodal biopsy showed inter-
mediate grade. The tumour exhibiting plasmablastic
features
recurred 26 months after treatment, the recurrence being a low-
grade plasmacytoma. The patient was subsequently salvaged using
high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue.
The local control difference is highly significant (P=0.0019)
between the group of low-grade tumours and the group of interme-
diate- and high-grade tumours. The overall survival is not signifi-
cant (P=0. 12) between these groups.
Seven of the sixteen cases with kappa light chain restriction and
one of the seven cases with lamda light chain restriction developed
local
recurrence.
Both
patients who
progressed
to
multiple
myeloma had kappa light chain restriction. Two patients showed
abundant stromal amyloid on their biopsy specimen; one of them
recurred locally and further progress to multiple myeloma, while
the second patient died of cerebral vascular accident at 61 months
after treatment with no evidence of disease. A patient with a
monoclonal band on serum protein electrophoresis on diagnosis
remains in remission 72 months after treatment.
DISCUSSION
Incidence
Extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMP) are uncommon tumours
and comprise only a small percentage of all plasma cell malignan-
cies. Pahor (1977), quoting the Birmingham Regional Cancer
Registry, gives the ratio of incidence of EMP to MM as 1:40. At
our hospital, we see about one case of EMP of head and neck
region
for an annual
average of 80 myeloma
registrations.
Seventy-five to eighty per cent of EMP cases occur in the submu-
cosa of the upper aerodigestive tract. The most common location is
in the nasal cavity, sinuses and nasopharynx. Men are predomi-
nantly affected, and these tumours are more commonly seen in the
sixth to eighth decades, as in this series. EMP arising in the head
and neck characteristically presents with localized disease, and all
but two of the patients reported here had no clinical lymph node
involvement. These observations are in agreement with most of
the large reported series (Wiltshaw, 1976; Pahor, 1977; Kapadia et
al, 1982; Mayr et al, 1990; Shih et al, 1995).

resonance imaging
Diagnostic criteria
The diagnostic criteria for EMP vary in different reported series.
Corwin and Lindberg (1979) and Mendenhall et al (1980) required
less than 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, while Knowling et
al (1983) required normal bone marrow biopsy for the diagnosis of
EMP. Soesan et al (1992) has accepted the diagnosis of EMP for
those plasma cell tumours which presented in an extramedullary
site and did not arise from bone marrow with a breach through the
bone cortex. Most authors agree that the detection of a monoclonal
band on serum protein electrophoresis or urinary Bence Jones
protein does not necessarily preclude the diagnosis. It is estimated
that about 25% of EMP will show a monoclonal band of serum
protein at the time of diagnosis. The monoclonal gammopathy
disappears
following
treatment
of localized
primary
tumour.
Subsequent development of a paraprotein may signal a recurrence
(Kapadia et al, 1982; Mock et al, 1987). Holland et al (1992) felt
that patients with paraprotein at the time of diagnosis fared worst,
while Harwood et al (1981), Soesan et al (1992) and Shih et al
(1995) suggested no effect on prognosis provided they return to
normal after treatment. Only one patient, in our series, had an IgA
monoclonal band on serum protein eletrophoresis at diagnosis, and
he has remained disease-free.
Bone destruction
The gross appearance of the tumour can be quite variable and can
appear as fleshy, yellowish grey to dark red sessile, polypoid or
pedunculated lesions. There may be destruction of adjacent bone
in direct continuity with the tumour mass. Poole and Marchetta
(1968), Gromer and Duvall (1973), Harwood et al (1981) and
Mock
et
al (1987)
felt that the presence of bone destruction
seemed to be an unfavourable prognostic factor, while Kotner and
Wang (1972), Corwin and Lindberg (1979), Kapadia et al (1982)
and Mayr et al (1990) were not of the same opinion. In our series,
two of three tumours with bone destruction recurred locally; one of
them was a solitary high-grade EMP, and the patient presented
with a huge tumour in the paranasal sinuses (Figure 6). The higher
grade tumours were generally associated with more bulky disease.
The second patient had a primary tumour in the middle ear with
destruction of the petrous bone and was treated before the era of
computerized tomography scan localization. Therefore, we are
unable to comment on the effects of bone destruction as an inde-
pendent factor with respect
to local control or conversion
to
multiple myeloma.
Pathology
Histologically,
plasmacytomas
have
the
typical
microscopic
appearance of a monomorphic infiltrate set in a sparse, delicate
and reticular stroma. The plasma cells themselves are character-
ized by round eccentric nuclei, with dense chromatin clumps
which are typically arranged along the nuclear membrane in a
'cartwheel'
fashion. The cytoplasm
is
abundant and
slightly
basophilic, usually with a paranuclear hof that corresponds to the
Golgi apparatus. Various forms of plasma cell atypia can be
encountered, depending on the degree of differentiation. While
atypia helps to establish the diagnosis of the plasma cell neoplasia,
definitive diagnosis of the latter requires demonstration of the
monoclonal character of the cell population, i.e. cells producing
either kappa or lamda light chain.
Kapadia et al (1982) graded their patients according to the
degree of atypia, mitoses and nuclear pleomorphism into well,
moderately and poorly differentiated tumours. They found that
four of six patients with poorly differentiated tumour died of
disseminated disease. Bartl et al (1987) has graded MM into a
three-tiered grading system to determine
factors of value in
predicting prognosis. We extended their same grading system, for
the first time in the literature, to our cases of EMP. Our results
show a correlation between histological grading and local aggres-
siveness of disease. Of the 18 low-grade tumours, 15 (83%) were
controlled with primary XRT, and one recurrence after 60 months
was salvaged with further XRT. In the intermediate- and high-
grade
group, only one of six
patients
treated
radically was
controlled with primary XRT, although four of the recurrences
were salvaged with further treatment. The local control between
these low- and higher grade tumours are highly statistically signif-
icant (P = 0.0019), however overall survival is not (P = 0.12). This
leaves us with the question of whether the higher grade tumours
should be treated differently in terms of either XRT dose and
volume or the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Mock et al (1987), in a retrospective analysis of 18 cases of
EMP of the head and neck, found that the commonest immuno-
globulin was IgG with kappa light chain restriction. They observed
the lowest rate of progression to MM with IgG, and none of the
cases with kappa light chain restriction progressed to MM. They
suggested that those cases with lamda light chain may be more
immature and more likely to progress to MM. In our series, 65%
(16 of 25) had kappa and 28% (seven patients) had lambda light
chain restriction. Both of the cases that progressed to MM showed
kappa light chain restriction.

SS Susnerwala et al
Wiltshaw (1976) and Kapadia et al (1982) had noticed the pres-
ence of abundant stromal amyloid deposit in the biopsy specimen in
their four patients and one patient, respectively, and could not find
any clinical correlation. Harwood et al (1981) had one patient with
abundant amyloid deposit in the biopsy specimen and observed a
slow rate of regression after XRT. The presence of abundant stromal
amyloid deposit was seen in two patients in our series. One of these
patients locally recurred after 60 months and was reirradiated. He
later developed MM at 120 months and died from this at 144
months with local control of primary disease. The second patient
died of an unrelated cause at 24 months, with no evidence of
myeloma. Therefore, we could not find any clinical correlation with
abundant stromal amyloid deposit in the biopsy specimen.
Radiotherapy
Mendenhall et al (1980), in a review of the literature, found a 94%
local control rate for localized plasmacytomas with doses in excess
of 40 Gy in 4 weeks compared with only 69% when doses less than
40 Gy were administered. Kotner and Wang (1972) and Woodruff et
al (1979) recommended a dose of 40-50 Gy in 4-5 weeks, while
Petrovich et al (1977) felt that a dose of 60-80 Gy in 6-8 weeks
should be given. Todd (1965), from our institute, recommended a
dose of 30-33 Gy given over 3 weeks using kilovoltage X-rays.
Similarly, Harwood et al (1981) suggested 35 Gy in 3 weeks for the
control of plasmacytomas.
It is important to note that all the
reported series refer to a small number of patients and are spread
over a long period of time with different XRT doses and fractiona-
tions. Our study suffers from the same problem and, therefore, we
are unable to determine a dose-response relationship. We can
conclude that our standard dose of 35-45 Gy in 3 weeks with mega-
voltage photons did initially control 70% (10 of 14) of cases. Two
failures occurred in both the low- and higher grade tumour groups.
The presence of involved cervical lymph nodes at the time of
diagnosis is seen in 10-20% of cases (Kotner and Wang, 1972;
Kapadia et al, 1982; Mayr et al, 1990). We encountered two
patients (8%) with clinically involved cervical lymph nodes at
diagnosis. One of them is in remission and the second patient died
with uncontrolled disease after receiving palliative XRT. Several
studies suggest that the presence of involved cervical nodes at
diagnosis or subsequent development does not affect the survival
or conversion to MM (Poole and Marchetta, 1968; Kotner and
Wang, 1972; Corwin and Lindberg, 1979; Mock et al, 1987). Some
authors recommend prophylactic cervical lymph nodal XRT as it
was the first site of relapse in their patients (Knowling et al, 1983;
Greenberg et al, 1987; Mayr et al, 1990; Shih et al, 1995). It is our
policy not to treat cervical lymph nodes electively. Only one
patient with a clinically negative neck relapsed in cervical lymph
nodes after primary XRT.
Conversion to MM
Progression to MM varies from 10% to 30% in EMP and is signif-
icantly lower than progression to MM following solitary plasma-
cytoma of bone (Wilthshaw, 1976; Knowling et al, 1983; Mayr et
al, 1990; Holland et al, 1992). The aggressive nature of solitary
plasmacytoma of bone in contrast to EMP is demonstrated by
Guida et al (1994). Our two patients (8%) who progressed to MM
did so after 6 and 120 months. Kapadia et al (1982) and Holland et
al (1992) found their patients progressed to MM within the first 2
years and suggested that this was the high-risk period. Most
authors recommend life-long follow-up as they have encountered
conversion to MM after 15 years (Rainer, 1970; Kotner and Wang,
1972; Gromer and Duvall, 1973; Wiltshaw, 1976; Pahor, 1977).
Management of local recurrences
Very few reported cases of local recurrence have been treated
primarily by surgery (Wiltshaw, 1976; Soesan et al, 1992). Surgery
is recommended if there is local failure after XRT in a resectable
tumour (Kotner and Wang, 1972). One of our cases had surgical
salvage. Two patients were retreated with XRT having relapsed
after 60 and 70 months. This was possible because plasmacytomas
are radiosensitive tumours when treated with moderate doses of
radiation, and relapse after a long interval permits retreatment.
The use of chemotherapy is described in the literature in cases of
recurrence or disseminated disease with varying response. Kapadia
et al (1982) advocates chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting in large
or poorly differentiated tumours. Wiltshaw (1978) and Soesan et al
(1992) found better results when they treated the patients with
locally invasive disease with adjuvant alkylating chemotherapy.
The patient with a high-grade tumour who had a local recurrence
was treated with high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood
stem cell rescue. This approach, in use for MM (Fermand et al,
1995), has not been previously reported for recurrent EMP. This
has proved to be successful in contrast to the three patients treated
with alkylating chemotherapy of melphalan and prednisolone.
CONCLUSION
Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a rare tumour which
predominantly occurs in the submucosa of the upper aerodigestive
tract. There is a strong male preponderance most commonly in the
sixth to eighth decades. From our clinicopathological correlation,
we conclude that tumour grading is the most important prognostic
factor. The grading criteria recommended for multiple myeloma
(MM) is applicable for EMP. We were unable to determine the
prognostic importance of adjacent bony involvement or clinically
involved lymph nodes. The majority of patients are elderly and
present with low-grade tumours. These low-grade tumours should
be treated with radiotherapy to the primary site with a dose equiv-
alent to 35-45 Gy in 3 weeks. The dose will depend on volume of
treatment and inclusion of critical structures but is well tolerated.
There is a place for retreatment with XRT if local recurrence
occurs after a long interval. We do not advocate elective neck irra-
diation. Conversion to MM is significantly lower with EMP
compared with solitary plasmacytoma of bone.
Tumours with higher grade EMP present with more bulky
disease and require large volume radiotherapy for control. The
poor local control with standard radiotherapy dose suggests that
higher doses should be used if these larger treatment volumes
permit; if not, we recommend treatment with adjuvant alkylating
chemotherapy in addition to local XRT for higher grade tumours -
this will reduce tumour bulk, enabling optimum local XRT to be
delivered. The use of intensive chemotherapy has a role in higher
grade tumour recurrence in patients with good performance status.

Summary The GER human pancreatic carcinoma cell line possesses receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. We report that the vitamin D
analogue EB 1089 inhibits the growth of these cells in vitro and when grown as tumour xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Tumour-bearing
mice were given EB 1089 at a dose of 5 gg kg-' body weight i.p. thrice weekly for 4-6 weeks. Tumour growth was significantly inhibited in treated
animals compared with controls in the absence of hypercalcaemia. These findings may have therapeutic implications in pancreatic cancer.
Keywords: pancreatic carcinoma; vitamin D; growth inhibition
Carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is an increasingly common
cancer but no effective chemotherapy has been developed for
patients with advanced disease. Initially, the presence of oestrogen
receptors (ER) in this tumour suggested that it might be responsive
to endocrine therapy (Andren-Sandberg and Backman,
1990;
Poston et al, 1990), but clinical trials with the anti-oestrogen
tamoxifen have not proved to be encouraging (Bakkevold et al,
1990; Taylor et al, 1993; Wong and Chan, 1993).
Receptors for another steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 [1,25(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D3] are also present in
GER, an extensively characterized cell line derived from a primary
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma that has been shown to produce
xenografts in nude mice (Grant et al, 1979, 1992, 1993). 1,25-
(OH)2D3 is known to inhibit the proliferation in vitro of a number
of established cancer cell lines (Colston et al, 1981; Frampton et
al, 1983; Dokoh et al, 1984), but its potent calcium-mobilizing
activity in vivo limits its potential as a therapeutic agent in hyper-
proliferative disorders.
Recently, new synthetic analogues of
vitamin D have been developed that have been shown to exhibit
potent anti-tumour effects in animal models of breast cancer
without causing marked hypercalcaemia (Abe et al, 1991; Colston
et al, 1992a and b). These analogues are currently under evalua-
tion in phase
MI/I
trials in patients with breast cancer. In this
preliminary
report,
we
have
extended
our
study
of
these
compounds to pancreatic carcinoma and have assessed the effects
of the synthetic vitamin D analogue EB 1089 on both the progres-
sion of xenografts developed from GER pancreatic adenocarci-
noma cells and the growth of cultured pancreatic adenocarcinoma
cells in vitro. Our results demonstrate that this novel vitamin D
analogue exhibits significant anti-tumour activity both in vitro and
in vivo, suggesting it should be considered as a potential candidate
for therapy in pancreatic carcinoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compounds
Vitamin D derivatives [1,25(OH)2D3 and EB 1089] were gifts from
Leo Pharmaceutical Products, Denmark, and 9-cis retinoic acid was
supplied by Hoffmann-La Roche (Nutley, NJ, USA). lax,25-dihy-
droxy
[26,27-methyl-3H]cholecalciferol
(180
Ci
mmol-')
and
2,4,6,7-[3H]oestradiol
(100 Ci mmol-1)
were
obtained
from
Amersham International (Amersham, Bucks, UK). Tissue culture
medium and
reagents
were purchased from Gibco
(Paisley,
Strathclyde, UK). All other analytical grade reagents were obtained
from Sigma (Poole, UK), unless otherwise stated.
Cellular effects
GER pancreatic carcinoma cells (Grant et al, 1979) were seeded
into 24-well plates (2 x 104 cells per well) and were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum,
2 mm glutamine, 100 U penicillin ml-' and 100 jg streptomycin
ml-' at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide for
24 h before treatment. EB 1089 or 9-cis retinoic acid was added in
ethanol (0.1% final media concentration) to give final concentra-
tions of 0.1-100 nm. Controls received ethanol alone and medium
was changed every second day. Cell number was assessed by
crystal violet assay (Wosikowski et al, 1993). MCF-7 breast and
MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells were routinely maintained in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with
5% fetal calf serum.
Western analysis and ligand binding
ER and vitamin D receptor (VDR) and p53 expression in cell
cultures were determined by Western analysis. MCF-7 breast and
GER pancreatic carcinoma cells were treated over a period of 1-4
days with EB 1089 (10 nM). After treatment, cell lysates were
prepared as previously described (James et al, 1994). Equivalent
protein extracts (5-15 gg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS poly-

in Materials and methods. Lane 1 untreated, Lane 2 untreated but with fresh
medium added to cultures 24 h before preparation of cell lysates. (C) Effects

***P < 0.005 compared with cell cultures treated with ethanol vehicle
acrylamide gels. Total protein was quantitated by the Bradford
method (Bradford, 1976), with uniform loading being confirmed by
Coomassie blue staining of replicate gels. Electrophoresed proteins
were transferred onto Hybond C-Super nitrocellulose membrane
(Amersham, Bucks, UK) and immunoprobed with a rat monoclonal
antibody recognizing mammalian VDR (Chemicon International,
Harrow, UK), the ER monoclonal
rat antibody H222 (Abbott
Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) or the mouse monoclonal anti-
body to p53, which recognizes wild-type and mutant forms (Ab-6,
Oncogene Science, NY, USA). Antibody binding was revealed
with a peroxidase-labelled sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary anti-
body (ER and VDR) or peroxidase-labelled sheep anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (p53). Specific proteins were visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, UK). A linear
relationship was observed between the amount of total lysate
protein electrophoresed and the signal intensity. Receptor levels
were quantitated by ligand binding assay (McGuire and De La
Garza, 1973; Colston et al, 1986; James et al, 1994).

Results, expressed as the percentage change in tumour volume from day 0,

the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. **P <0.01; *** P < 0.005. (B)
Comparison of EB 1089 (5 pg kg-' i.p. thrice weekly) and 5-fluorouracil
(20 mg kg-' i.p. thrice weekly) on progression of GER pancreatic carcinoma
xenografts over 6 weeks of treatment. Results are expressed as the
percentage change in tumour volume from day 0 (mean Â± sem. n = 9).
Treatment with EB 1089 significantly inhibited tumour progression
compared with controls (*P < 0.05 **P < 0.01 Mann-Whitney U-test). At
6 weeks of treatment, serum calcium concentration in animals treated with
this dose of EB 1089 was not significantly different from controls (mean
2.35 Â± 0.11 mmol-' 2.27 Â± 0.08 mmol-' in controls). Difference in percentage
change in tumour volume between 5-fluorouracil treated and control groups
was not significant at any time point
Animal protocol
Female nude (Nu/Nu, MFI strain) mice, 6-8 weeks of age (Olac,
UK) were maintained on
sterilized tap water and irradiated
standard rodent chow. GER pancreatic tumour xenografts were
developed as previously described (Grant et al, 1979), and mice
bearing palpable tumours (0.2-0.4 cm in diameter) were randomly
assigned to treated or control (vehicle-alone) groups. EB 1089 was
given
intraperitoneally
in
0.1 ml of propylene
glycol/0.05 M
disodium hydrogen phosphate (4:1, v/v). Tumour volume was
determined weekly as previously described (Colston et al, 1992a).
No tumour exceeded 1.2 cm in diameter or 10% of total body
weight. At the end of each experiment animals were exsanguinated
under halothane anaesthesia and serum was stored at -20Â°C until
analysed.
Statistical methods
Percentage change in total tumour volume at each week of study
was
compared
between
groups
using
the
non-parametric
Mann-Whitney U-test. Comparisons of the biochemical and in
vitro studies used the unpaired Student's t-test.
RESULTS
Ligand binding assays with cytosols from GER pancreatic carci-
noma cells showed that the cells were VDR positive (63 fmol mg-'
cytosol protein) but these cells did not contain detectable amounts
of ER (Figure IA). A similar pattern of receptor expression was
seen with MIA PaCa-2 cells (VDR 24 and ER < 1 fmol mg-'
cytosol protein). ER protein could not be detected by Western
analysis in GER cells but was readily detected in MCF-7 breast
cancer cells (Figure 1B). VDR protein was detected by Western
blot analysis in both GER and MCF-7 cell lines and treatment of
these cells with 10 nM EB 1089 for 4 days increased the level of
VDR protein (Figure IC). In MCF-7 cells, EB 1089 increased p53
protein levels at 4 days. Treatment of GER cells with EB 1089 for
24, 48 and 96 h revealed no appreciable difference in p53 protein
levels relative to controls (Figure IC).
Cell proliferation studies showed that the analogue EB 1089
produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the growth of GER cells.
Maximal effects were seen at a concentration of 100 nm (Figure
2A). Inhibition of growth was also observed over a period of 8
days with the vitamin D analogue and also with the same concen-
tration (100 nM) of 9-cis retinoic acid (Figure 2B).
The effects of EB 1089 on in vivo pancreatic carcinoma growth
were evaluated using GER tumour xenografts. Dose regimens
were chosen on the basis of our previous findings in rats, which
have indicated that the elimination half-life of EB 1089 is in the
order of 3-5 h (Binderup et al, 1991). Initially, the analogue was
given intraperitoneally to mice bearing tumour xenografts at doses
of 2.5 and 5 gg kg-' body weight three times a week for 4 weeks.
At a dose of 5 ,ug kg-' thrice weekly, EB 1089 caused significant
inhibition of growth (Figure 3A). Mean serum calcium in controls
was 2.19 Â± 0.053 mmol 1-' and 2.49 Â± 0.074 mmol 1-' in the treated
group (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in body
weight between control and treated groups
at 4 weeks and
treated animals remained healthy. However, animals treated with
5 jig kg-' five times weekly showed weight loss after 2 weeks of
treatment (mean serum calcium in animals treated with this dose
regimen was 2.81 Â± 0.068 mmol 1-'). At this time, mean tumour
volume was 85% of initial value. With the lower dose (2.5 jig kg-'
thrice weekly), differences between treated and control groups
were not significant at 28 days (P = 0.24). Finally, effects of EB
1089 (5 jg kg-' thrice weekly) were compared with those of 5-
fluorouracil (20 mg kg-'). Figure 3B illustrates the tumour growth
curves with these two agents. At the end of the 6 week treatment
period, significant inhibition of tumour progression was observed
in the group receiving EB 1089 (P = 0.007). However, differences
between 5-fluorouracil-treated and control groups were not signif-
icant (P = 0.068 Mann-Whitney U-test).

DISCUSSION
Our studies demonstrate that pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells
possess specific receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 (VDR) and are func-
tionally responsive to the growth inhibitory effects of the vitamin
D analogue EB 1089 both in vitro and in vivo. As far as we are
aware, this is the first demonstration that a vitamin D derivative
may demonstrate in vivo anti-tumour effects in a xenograft model
of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. At a dose of 5 ,tg kg-' body weight
thrice weekly, EB
1089 inhibited progression of established
tumours in the absence of hypercalcaemia; animals did not lose
weight and remained healthy. At the present time, the mechanisms
by which EB 1089 may exert inhibitory effects on the growth of
these pancreatic carcinoma cells is not clear. In MCF-7 breast
cancer cells, the vitamin D analogue binds to VDR and strongly
inhibits the proliferation of these cells with a potency 50-100
times that of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Colston et al, 1992b; Mathiasen et al,
1993).
It has also been demonstrated that EB 1089 increases
expression of p53 protein in MCF-7 cells (James et al, 1995),
which acts as a cell cycle checkpoint regulator (Kuerbitz et al,
1992). However, our preliminary findings presented here indicate
that the effects of EB 1089 on GER cell growth are independent of
changes in p53 expression.
Inhibitory effects of retinoids on the growth of human pancre-
atic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo have recently been reported
(Bold et al, 1996) and EB 1089 has been demonstrated to enhance
the growth-inhibitory effects of all-trans retinoic acid in certain
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (Zugmaier et al, 1996). Our studies
have additionally demonstrated that EB 1089 and 9-cis retinoic
acid act separately to inhibit the growth of GER cells. We have
already demonstrated that these compounds act in a co-operative
manner to enhance induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells (James et al, 1995); these observations, together with our
present findings with pancreatic carcinoma cells, may have thera-
peutic implications. It is also important to note that neither of the
two pancreatic carcinoma cell lines studied possessed oestrogen
receptors. The absence of these receptors in some tumours may
well account for the limited success of tamoxifen therapy in
pancreatic carcinoma.

DISCUSSION 
Transmission of CMV occurs in 40% to 50% of infants 
subjected to primary CMV infection during pregnancy. 
Modes of transmission include transplacental spread and 
contact with cervical secretions during delivery. Ten to 
fifteen percent of these infants will be symptomatic.â 
Twenty to forty percent of seropositive women shed 
CMV into their breast milk. Asymptomatic CMV i+c- 
tion will develop in 60% of these infants. The premature 
infant with prolonged hospitalization and blood transfu- 
sion has a 15% acquisition rate of CMV infection.3 
Ninety five percent of c&genitally 
seropositive infants 
are asymptomatic, but in 10% to 15% abnormalitiesâsuch

as hearing loss (lo%), psychomotor retardation or neuro- 
muscular disorder (2-7%), learning disability (4%), den- 
tal defect (3%), and chorioretinitis (1%) will eventually 
develop. Of the affected infants, the most severe but least 
common presentation is cytomegalic inclusion disease 
(CID). CID carries a 20% mortality rate. The clinical 
findings include jaundice, hepatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, 
thrombocytopenia, 
purpuric rash, microcephaly, menin- 
gioencephalitis, 
chorioretinitis, 
cerebral calcifications, 
and hearing loss4 Congenital anomalies associated with 
CID include clubfoot, inguinal hernia, strabismus, high- 
arched palate, and defective tooth enamel5 
Detection of CMV in the urine or saliva in the first 2 
weeks of life is best for diagnosis of congenital CMV 
because postnatally acquired CMV infection can cause 
confusion. Other methods of diagnosis include biopsy, 
histology, immunohistology, serologic assays, CMV DNA 
by polymerase chain reaction, and CMV antigenemia.5x6 
Intrauterine 
CMV 
infection 
has presented as fetal 
meconium peritonitis. This infant was exposed to CMV 
during the late first trimester. A prenatal ultrasound scan 
performed at 22 weeksâ gestation showed irregular echo- 
genie intraabdominal mass with calcified and echolucent 
areas consistent with intrauterine bowel perforation. This 
infant was born with mild respiratory distress, hepato- 
splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. CMV study results 
were positive. He did not have a bowel obstruction after 
birth.6 
There are a few reports of NEC associated with CMV 
in the French and Italian literature. 
Gretillat 
et al7 
reported CMV inclusion bodies in the intestine of an 
infant who had NEC. Sann et al8 described 11 cases of 
necrotizing 
enterocolitis 
during an 1 s-month period. 
CMV was present in six of these patients. NEC accounted 
for 22% of symptoms 
associated with 
CMV. They 
concluded that CMV may act as an aggravating factor of 
NEC8 Colonic stricture after NEC was found to be 
associated with CMV in reports by DâAgostino et al9 and 
Foumier et al.rO Each investigator suggested CMV as the 
primary pathogen or suprainfection in the evolution of 
NEC in these two patients. 
Cytomegalovirus enteritis in the immunocompromised 
pediatric and adult patient has been well documented.*i,13 
These patients suffer from intestinal ulceration, perfora- 
tion, hemorrhagic proctocolitis, pseudomembrane forma- 
tion, and toxic megacolon. The virulent clinical course 
usually mandates early diagnosis and treatment 
for 
survival. Treatment modalities include reduction of immu- 
nosuppression, gancyclovir, foscarnet, and surgery. CMV 
enteritis in these newborns did not appear to carry the 
same virulence experienced by the immunocompromised 
host. All the infected newborn infants presented survived 
without treatment targeted at CMV. 
The list for pathogens responsible for NEC has in- 
cluded Escherichin coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, 
Clos- 
tridia species, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Entero- 
coccus, Candida, 
Coxsnckie B2 and Coronavirus.L4 
Cytomegalovirus should be added to this list.

Abstract Objective: To evaluate the 
incidence, clinical features, and 
prognosis of pulmonary complica- 
tions associated with toxic epider- 
mal necrolysis 
Design: Prospective study. 
Setting: Dermatology intensive care 
unit in Mondor Hospital, France. 
Patients: 41 consecutive patients. 
Interventions: On admission, then 
daily, respiratory evaluation was 
based on clinical examination, chest 
X-ray, and arterial blood gas analy- 
sis. When clinical symptoms, X-ray 
abnormalities, or hypoxemia [partial 
pressure of oxygen (PO2) 
< 80 mm Hg] were present, fiberop- 
tic bronchoscopy was performed. 
Results: 10 patients presented early 
manifestations: dyspnea (n = 10), 
bronchial hypersecretion (n = 7), 
marked hypoxemia (n -- 10) 
(PO2 = 59 + 8 mm Hg). Chest X-ray 
was normal (n = 8) or showed inter- 
stitial infiltrates (n = 2). In these 
10 patients, fiberoptic bronchoscopy 
demonstrated sloughing of bron- 
chial epithelium in proximal air- 
ways. Delayed pulmonary complica- 
tions occurred in 6 of these 10 pa- 
tients from day 7 to day 15: pulmo- 
nary edema (n = 2), atelectasis 
(n = 1), bacterial pneumonitis 
(n = 4). Mechanical ventilation was 
required in 9 patients. A fatal out- 
come occurred in 7 patients. Seven 
patients did not develop early pul- 
monary manifestations (PO2 on ad- 
mission 87 + 6 mm Hg) but only de- 
layed pulmonary symptoms related 
to atelectasis (n = 1), pulmonary 
edema (n = 4), and bacterial pneu- 
monitis (n = 3); bronchial epithelial 
detachment was not observed. None 
of them required mechanical venti- 
lation and all recovered with appro- 
priate therapy. 
Conclusions: ""Specific"" involve- 
ment of bronchial epithelium was 
noted in 27 % of cases and must be 
suspected when dyspnea, bronchial 
hypersecretion, normal chest X-ray, 
and marked hypoxemia are present 
during the early stages of toxic epi- 
dermal necrosis. Bronchial injury 
seems to indicate a poor prognosis, 
as mechanical ventilation was re- 
quired for most of these patients and 
was associated with a high mortality.

Fig.1 Toxic epidermal necrolysis: typical aspect of skin detach- 
ment resembling scalding 
Introduction 
In 1956, Lyell reported four cases of a skin eruption re- 
sembling scalding and related to either drug toxicity, sta- 
phylococcal infection, or undetermined etiology [1]. In 
fact, this original article included three different diseases 
corresponding to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 
generalized fixed eruptions due to drugs, and toxic epi- 
dermal necrolysis (TEN) [2, 3]. With further cases and 
larger series, it became generally accepted that TEN 
was a drug-induced skin reaction. The main drugs incri- 
minated in TEN are antibacterial sulfonamides, anticon- 
vulsants, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, 
and allopurinol [4-6]. In a few cases, TEN has been 
demonstrated to be related to Mycoplasma infection [7] 
or graft-versus-host disease (GVH) [8]. TEN is charac- 
terized by extensive epidermal detachment with mucous 
membrane involvement (Fig. 1), whereas the Stevens- 
Johnson syndrome (SJS) corresponds to a mild form of 
TEN with predominant mucosal involvement but epi- 
dermal detachment affecting less than 10 % of the body 
surface area. TEN is rare since its incidence is estimated 
to be in the range of 1 to 1.5 cases/million per year. How- 
ever, it is a life-threatening disease, fatal in 30 % of cases, 
and death is mainly related to sepsis or visceral involve- 
ment such as gastrointestinal or pulmonary complica- 
tions [9, 10]. Pulmonary manifestations have been poor- 
ly studied but appear to be heterogeneous, including 
specific bronchial mucosal necrosis, pulmonary edema, 
and infectious pneumonitis, as described in a few isolat- 
ed case reports or rare postmortem studies [11-15]. The 
aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the in- 
cidence of pulmonary manifestations in TEN, to define 
their clinical characteristics, and to determine their 
prognosis in a large prospective series. 
Patients and methods 
Patients 
Forty-one consecutive patients admitted to our Dermatological In- 
tensive Care Unit (Henri Mondor Hospital, Cr6teil, France) with 
epidermal detachment affecting more than 10 % of the body sur- 
face area (BSA) were enrolled in the study from January 1992 to 
September 1995. Cases of TEN associated with human immunode- 
ficiency virus infection, Mycoplasma pneumonitis, or GVH disease 
were not included. Patients were clinically classified as overlap 
SJS-TEN when the epidermal detachment ranged from 10 to 
30 % of BSA and as TEN when the epidermal detachment exceed- 
ed 30 % of BSA [16]. The diagnosis was confirmed by a skin biop- 
sy showing detachment of full thickness epidermis and/or total epi- 
dermal necrosis. Drug causality was assessed according to the offi- 
cial method of the French Pharmacovigilance Centers [17]. 
On the day of admission, then daily, respiratory monitoring was 
performed, based on clinical examination, chest X-ray, and arterial 
blood gas analysis. When clinical symptoms were present, such as 
polypnea (respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min) or bronchial hyperse- 
cretion, and were associated with X-ray abnormalities or hypoxe- 
mia [partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2 < 80 mm Hg in room air], a di- 
agnostic procedure using fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was per- 
formed. Four patients were excluded from the study due to previous 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 3) or chronic heart fail- 
ure (n = 1) associated with a low baseline PO2. In these cases, PO: 
values on admission were 68 + 4 mmHg but remained unchanged 
after recovery. FOB was not performed despite a PO 2 < 80 mmHg 
on admission. The study group therefore consisted of 37 patients. 
FOB and associated procedures 
Bronchoscopy was performed using an Olympus BF P30 fiberoptic 
bronchoscope (Olympus, France) in the usual manner. After endo- 
bronchial examination, bacterial analysis was performed according 
to the Plugged Telescoping Catheter (PTC) procedure, using a 
PTC unit (Combicath 5828.20; Plastimed Lab, Saint-Leu la Forrt, 
France) [18]. A positive culture was defined as the recovery of 
> 103 colony-forming units/ml of a potential pathogen. When bron- 
chial mucosa detachment was present, repeated FOBs were per- 
formed in order to aspirate epithelial fragments. 
For each patient, at least three bronchial biopsy specimens 
were taken at different levels in the right bronchial tract. Samples 
were fixed by immersion in Bouin's solution and then paraffin em- 
bedded or fixed by 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.045 M cacodylate 
buffer, pH 7.4 for semithin section processing. 
Ancillary studies 
Blood cell count, blood cultures, and serological studies for Myco- 
plasma were performed routinely for each patient. Skin bacterial 
samples were cultured on petri dishes every 48 h. Pulmonary func- 
tion was monitored by repeated blood arterial gas analyses during 
the course of TEN. 
Patient classification according to pulmonary manifestations 
Patients were classified into three groups according to pulmonary 
manifestations: group 1 comprised patients with no pulmonary 
manifestations on admission or during the course of the disease; 
group 2 had patients with pulmonary manifestations during the

first 48 h after admission; group 3 included patients with delayed 
pulmonary manifestations appearing more than 48 h after admis- 
sion to our department. 
Statistical analysis 
Intergroup comparisons were made using Student's t-test and, 
when appropriate, the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. The 
Fisher exact test was used to compare the proportion of deceased 
patients in each group. 
Results 
Study population 
Altogether, 73 % of patients were admitted from other 
French hospitals, as our dermatology 
unit is considered 
as a national reference 
center. The delay between 
the 
first mucocutaneous 
symptoms 
and admission 
to our 
center was in the range of 1 to 4 days. Table 1 summa- 
rizes the clinical features and lists the offending drugs 
in the 37 patients 
studied. There 
were 14 males 
and 
1240 
23 females, with a mean age of 42 + 19 years (range 14- 
85 years). Sixteen patients were classified as overlap 
SJS-TEN and the remaining 21 patients were classified 
as TEN. Overlap SJS-TEN and TEN were related to an 
adverse drug reaction in 32 patients and in 5 patients 
the cause was not determined. BSA involvement was 
10 to 100 % (mean 34 + 20 %). Mucous membrane le- 
sions in the oral cavity were associated with skin lesions 
in all patients. 
Patients without pulmonary manifestations (group 1) 
Of the 37 patients, 20 were classified as group 1 [54 %; 
95 % confidence interval (CI) 37-70 %). The mean age 
in this group was 41 + 22 years. The mean BSA involve- 
ment was 29 + 17 % (range 10-75 %). All patients had 
associated oropharyngeal mucosal lesions. Chest X-ray 
was normal and arterial PO 2 was 95 + 8 mm Hg on ad- 
mission and remained in the normal range during the 
course of TEN. Three patients in this group died of sep- 
tic shock during the course of TEN. 
Early pulmonary manifestations (group 2) 
Clinical features 
Of the 37 patients, 10 were classified as group 2 (27 %; 
95 % CI 14-44 %) (Table 1). The mean age in this group 
was 45 + 19 years. The delay between first symptoms 
and admission was in the range of 1 to 3 days. The mean 
BSA involvement was 44 + 28 % (range 15-100 %). All 
patients presented with respiratory symptoms on admis- 
sion. Dyspnea associated with increased respiratory rate 
was a constant clinical feature. Bronchial hypersecretion 
was observed in 7 of the 10 patients. Hypersecretion was 
abundant and appeared as a yellow, fluid, transparent 
sputum without any purulence, as demonstrated by spu- 
tum cytological examination. None of the patients in 
this group had evidence of bronchial casts in their spu- 
tum. Chest X-ray was normal in 8 patients but showed 
interstitial infiltrates in 2 patients. Blood gas analysis in 
room air during the first 48 h revealed a marked hypoxe- 
mia with a mean PO 2 of 59+8mmHg 
(range 47- 
72 mmHg) associated with respiratory alkalosis. PO 2 
values on admission in group 2 were significantly lower 
than in groups 1 or 3 (p < 0.0001). 
FOB results 
Bronchoscopy examination revealed a pattern of diffuse 
loss of bronchial epithelium involving the proximal air- 
ways. Patients were investigated during the first 48 h 
after admission, corresponding to day 3 to 4 from the on-

stage of detachment, b mucosal ulceration due to bronchial muco-

set of skin manifestations. Mucosal detachment involved 
up to 50 % of bronchial mucosa by the first examination 
and was close to 100 % of bronchial surface area at later 
stages. Bronchial involvement was characterized, in the 
early stages, by areas of white ground-glass appearance, 
evolving toward areas of red denuded mucosa associ- 
ated with the presence of bronchial casts. At later stages, 
the confluence of bronchial ulcerations contributed to 
form a diffuse abrasive pattern (Fig. 2). Protected bron- 
chial sampling remained sterile in every case. 
Histologic findings 
Bronchial biopsies confirmed epithelial necrosis as sug- 
gested macroscopically by large ulcerations or complete 
abrasion of bronchial epithelium. The lamina propria 
was only lined with denuded basement membrane and 
the inflammatory features were the presence of numer- 
ous infiltrating mononuclear cells, including lympho- 
cytes, monocytes, and plasma cells, and by dilatation of 
small vessels (Fig. 3). There was no evidence of histologic 
criteria consistent with an infectious process such as pre- 
dominant polymorphonuclear cell infiltration or multi- 
nucleated giant cells suggesting viral infection. Repeated 
FOB and biopsies were performed during the course of 
TEN in 3 surviving patients in group 2, allowing assess- 
ment of the time of re-epithelialization. Normal bron- 
chial mucosa began to recover at the same time as skin re-

Staphylococcus (n = 1), Acinetobacter baumanii (n = 2), 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n--2). Two pathogens 
were identified (Staphylococcus+Acinetobacter) 
in 
1 patient. In all cases, pathogens had been previously 
isolated from skin samples. Three of these 6 patients 
died from septic shock or the adult respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) related to bacterial pneumonitis, de- 
spite appropriate antibiotic therapy. The remaining 
3 patients recovered. The mortality in group 2 appeared 
to be statistically higher than that reported for patients 
without bronchial injury (groups 1 + 3) (p < 0.002).

chial epithelial metaplasia corresponding to glandular 
(n -- 1) or squamous (n = 1) bronchial metaplasia (Fig. 3). 
Outcome 
Mechanical ventilation in this group, was required for 
9 patients and nasal oxygen therapy was required in 
1 patient. Four patients died from acute respiratory fail- 
ure during the first few hours despite early ventilatory 
support. The 6 remaining patients developed further de- 
layed complications, including atelectasis (n = 1), pul- 
monary edema (n =2), and bacterial pneumonitis 
(n = 4). One developed both pulmonary edema and in- 
fectious pneumonitis. Bacterial pathogens isolated by 
the PTC procedure consisted of methicillin-resistant 
Delayed pulmonary manifestations (group 3) 
Clinical data 
Seven of the 37 patients were classified as group 3 
(19 %; 95 % CI: 8-35 %) (Table 1). The mean age was 
44 _+ 10 years. The delay between first symptoms and ad- 
mission was in the range of 2 to 5 days. The mean BSA 
involvement was 35 _+9% (range 25-50%). The pa- 
tients had no pulmonary manifestations on admission 
(mean PO2 87 + 6 mmHg) but developed nonspecific 
pulmonary manifestations, including atelectasis (n = 1), 
pulmonary edema related to fluid overload (n = 4), and 
bacterial pneumonia (n = 3), from day 5 to day 10. One 
patients developed both pulmonary edema and bacte- 
rial pneumonitis. Bacterial pathogens isolated by the 
PTC procedure consisted of methicillin-resistant Sta- 
phylococcus (n = 1), Acinetobacter baumanii (n = 1), 
and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1). 
FOB data 
Bronchoscopy examination was performed from day 5 
to day 10. The macroscopic appearance of the mucosa 
was normal in all 7 patients. 
Histologic findings 
Three bronchial biopsies in each patient confirmed the 
absence of bronchial epithelial necrosis. In 2 patients, a 
mild polymorphonuclear cell infiltration was observed 
in the bronchial lamina propria and was related to asso- 
ciated bacterial pneumonitis, as demonstrated by the 
PTC procedure. 
Outcome 
None of the patients in group 3 required ventilatory 
support. All recovered from the delayed pulmonary 
complications with appropriate therapy.

Discussion 
Pulmonary complications have been occasionally re- 
ported in the course of TEN in a few isolated cases 
[11-14]. However, to our knowledge, this study is the 
first prospective evaluation of respiratory tract involve- 
ment in a large series of patients with TEN. In our study, 
early pulmonary complications occurred in about 25 % 
of cases (95 % CI 14-44 %) and corresponded to bron- 
chial mucosal sloughing, as demonstrated by FOB. Re- 
spiratory symptoms related to bronchial epithelium de- 
tachment developed within the 4 days after the onset of 
mucocutaneous symptoms. 
Bronchial involvement in TEN does not appear to be 
correlated with the extent of epidermal detachment or 
with related offending drugs. In this series, and in most 
of the cases reported in the literature, dyspnea and 
bronchial hypersecretion are usually the first clinical 
symptoms. Interestingly, hypersecretion was present in 
7 out of 10 patients and was characterized by a fluid, yel- 
low, nonpurulent sputum, suggesting plasma exudation 
across the altered bronchial epithelial barrier. It is note- 
worthy that the chest X-ray was normal on admission in 
most cases but further X-rays soon revealed interstitial 
infiltrates highly suggestive of pulmonary edema. How- 
ever, alveolar epithelial involvement was not estab- 
lished in this study as none of the patients who died of 
acute respiratory failure were autopsied. 
In one case of TEN with multiple organ failure de- 
scribed in the literature, necrosis of the alveolar walls 
was reported but autopsy was performed after a long 
period of assisted ventilation and septic complications, 
raising the question of the specificity of these pathologic 
findings [13]. Other pulmonary manifestations related 
to bronchial mucosal involvement have been described 
elsewhere, including mild hemoptysis [12] or expectora- 
tion of bronchial mucosal casts, which seems highly sug- 
gestive of bronchial mucosal involvement [14]. In all 
cases, acute respiratory failure developed rapidly after 
the onset of skin detachment. In 6 cases in this series, re- 
spiratory distress was associated with severe hypoxemia 
(_< 60mmHg) at the time of admission and required 
immediate ventilatory support. In the remaining 4 cases, 
arterial POz was moderately altered (ranging from 64 to 
72 mm Hg) on admission but dropped dramatically dur- 
ing the following 24 h, justifying mechanical ventilatory 
assistance in 3 out of 4 patients. 
Our results are in agreement with those previously 
reported since ventilatory support was required in all 
cases described in the literature [11-13]. Mechanical 
ventilation was used according to the recent consensus 
conference guidelines [19]. In patients with ARDS, vo- 
lume-controlled ventilation using 7 to 10 ml/kg tidal vo- 
lume was performed in order to keep the pressure pla- 
teau below 35 cm H20. Positioning of these patients (su- 
pine/prone) was not routinely performed since the ben- 
efit of this strategy has not been proved. Moreover, 
skin lesions made it difficult to turn these patients. In 
contrast, the 27 patients with no early respiratory symp- 
toms or hypoxemia did not require ventilatory support 
in the course of the disease. However, in absence of re- 
spiratory symptoms, FOB was not performed and there- 
fore we cannot exclude the possibility of bronchial in- 
volvement in group 1. Interestingly, FOB was per- 
formed in 7 patients who developed only delayed com- 
plications between day 5 and day 10 after the onset of 
TEN, an interval which would reasonably exclude the 
possibility of early re-epithelialization. No bronchial 
mucosal detachment was observed in these 7 patients. 
Such results therefore suggest that bronchial involve- 
ment is associated with early respiratory symptoms and 
marked hypoxemia developing simultaneously with or 
very soon after the onset of skin manifestations. Fur- 
thermore, bronchial mucosal involvement seems to be 
related to a poor prognosis, constituting a high risk fac- 
tor for acute respiratory failure. 
FOB appeared to be a simple procedure to identify 
bronchial mucosal detachment in TEN. Moreover, this 
study demonstrated a good correlation between the 
bronchoscopic appearance of the mucosa and histologi- 
cal lesions of the bronchial epithelium. In 10 patients 
with early pulmonary manifestations and the appear- 
ance of mucosal erosions at bronchoscopy, histological 
examination revealed large areas of epithelial necrosis 
identified at different levels of the bronchial tree, 
whereas in 7 patients with only delayed pulmonary com- 
plications, there was no evidence of bronchial detach- 
ment at bronchoscopy and bronchial biopsy specimens 
were normal. Histological findings were characterized 
by extensive necrosis of bronchial epithelium without 
any alteration of basement membrane or lamina pro- 
pria. Cell alterations consistent with viral infection 
such as cell ballooning, viral inclusion, giant cells, or 
syncytia formation were absent. Moreover, bacterial 
analysis of bronchial protected samples remained nega- 
tive, leading us to consider that an infectious process 
was unlikely. Interestingly, airway sloughing and skin 
detachment appeared to be synchronous and both re- 
generated over the same time interval, suggesting ""spe- 
cific"" TEN bronchial epithelial involvement. 
The basic mechanisms responsible for skin and/or 
bronchial mucosa necrolysis in TEN remain unknown. 
Cell-mediated cytotoxicity has been suggested by infil- 
tration of inflammatory cells in areas of epidermal ne- 
crolysis [20, 21]. Among these ceils, monocytes/macro- 
phages and T-cell lymphocytes infiltrating dermis and 
epidermis could play a crucial role via local TNFa and 
cytotoxic secretion [22-24]. It is noteworthy that the 
predominant inflammatory cells infiltrating bronchial 
mucosa in patients developing ""specific"" TEN bronchial 
mucosal involvement mainly consisted of mononuclear 
cells. Recent studies have emphasized the role of the 
1243 
toxicity of metabolites of offending drugs [25, 26]. Such 
variations of metabolism could be related to genetic sus- 
ceptibility [26, 27]. Toxic and immunological mecha- 
nisms are not mutually exclusive, since cell-mediated cy- 
totoxicity might develop against toxic metabolites [28]. 
Delayed pulmonary complications were observed in 
all surviving patients displaying bronchial epithelial de- 
tachment and in 25 % of patients with no early pulmo- 
nary manifestations. They mainly consisted of pulmon- 
ary edema and infectious pneumonitis. The mechanisms 
of pulmonary edema were not clearly established in our 
series. Although alteration of the bronchopulmonary 
epithelial barrier can be suspected in patients with bron- 
chial mucosal detachment, fluid overload seems to oc- 
cur more frequently in pulmonary edema since treat- 
ment of TEN requires a large fluid intake, including wa- 
ter, electrolytes, and macromolecular solutions [5]. 
Moreover, fluid balance control is not easily obtained, 
since central venous pressure monitoring is avoided 
due to the risk of systemic infection [29]. 
Bacterial pneumonitis is another frequent complica- 
tion of TEN. Interestingly, we found a good correlation 
between bacteria isolated from the skin and those iso- 
lated from lung samples by PTC. Such findings could 
be useful to treat bacterial pneumonitis empirically be- 
fore complete identification of the pathogens responsi- 
ble for pneumonitis. In conclusion, the present study in- 
dicates that bronchial epithelial necrosis occurs in about 
25 % of cases of TEN and corresponds to a specific 
TEN-related disorder. This bronchial involvement ap- 
pears to be an index of poor prognosis, as demonstrated 
by the short-term progression toward acute respiratory 
failure and the frequent development of delayed com- 
plications. Therefore FOB appears to be useful in pa- 
tients with suspected pulmonary complications: (i) to 
identify bronchial involvement, (ii) to evaluate the 
prognosis, and (iii) to eliminate associated pneumonitis 
using appropriate bacterial sampling. Moreover, bron- 
chial aspiration during FOB prevents atelectasis pro- 
duced by sloughing of bronchial epithelium. To our 
knowledge, there is no demonstrated specific treatment 
for TEN and obviously for bronchial involvement. Fur- 
ther prospective studies would be required to determine 
the value of early ventilatory support to reduce early 
mortality related to the progression of pulmonary com- 
plications.

Summary Individuals with a deficiency in the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) may experience severe life-threatening
toxicity when treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). As routine measurement of enzyme activity is not practical in many clinical centres, we have
investigated the use of DNA mutation analysis to identify cancer patients with low enzyme levels. We have identified two new mutations at
codons 534 and 543 in the DPD cDNA of a patient with low enzyme activity and screened the DNA from 75 colorectal cancer patients for
these mutations and the previously reported splice site mutation (Vreken et al, 1996; Wei et al, 1996). In all cases, DPD enzyme activity was
also measured. The splice site mutation was detected in a patient (1 out of 72) with low enzyme activity whereas mutations at codons 534
(2 out of 75) and 543 (11 out of 23) were not associated with low enzyme activity. These studies highlight the need to combine DPD genotype
and phenotype analysis to identify mutations that result in reduced enzyme activity.

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is widely used in the treatment of advanced
solid tumours, including colorectal, breast and head/neck tumours.
5-FU
is
also frequently used in adjuvant chemotherapy
for
colorectal and breast cancers, in which its mild toxicity profile of
mucositis and diarrhoea is well tolerated by patients who are at
risk for tumour recurrence but have no current evidence of disease.
5-FU is a pyrimidine analogue and greater than 80% of a dose is
degraded in a three-step pathway, initially catalysed by the enzyme
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD; E.C. 1.3.1.2., Heggie et
al, 1987). Deficiency in DPD enzyme activity is associated with a
considerable delay in clearance of 5-FU from the plasma (Diasio
et al, 1988; Fleming et al, 1992), leading to severe, life-threatening
diarrhoea, neutropenia and in some cases neurotoxicity, incurring
prolonged
hospitalization (Milano and Etienne,
1996). High
concentrations of plasma and urine 5-FU, uracil and thymine may
be detected along with low mononuclear cell DPD activity in these
patients. The toxicity is thought to result from higher levels of
5-FU entering the anabolic pathway, resulting in an increased
production of cytotoxic nucleotides. Although thymidine rescue
has been attempted in one case (Takimoto et al, 1996), the majority
of cases have been managed with supportive care after the cessa-
tion of 5-FU-based therapy. DPD activity is found in most human
tissues, with the highest levels in the liver and lymphocytes.
Population
studies
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cell
(PBMNC) DPD have shown that enzyme activity is variable with
a seven- to 10-fold range observed (Lu et al, 1993; Etienne et al,
1994; McMurrough and McLeod, 1996). These studies suggest
that although total deficiency is rare in adults, as many as 3% of
the population may have low enzyme levels and thus be at

increased risk of severe toxicity if treated with 5-FU. Such indi-
viduals would benefit from identification before the administration
of 5-FU-based therapy, particularly in the context of adjuvant
treatment. One mutation in the DPYD gene has been reported to
date in patients exhibiting severe toxicity after 5-FU treatment: a
mutation at a splice donor site leading to the skipping of a 165-bp
exon (Vreken et al, 1996; Wei et al, 1996). The splice site mutation
may be present in 1% of Finnish individuals but is much rarer in
British, Japanese, Afro-American and Dutch individuals (Vreken
et al, 1996; Wei et al, 1996), although in these studies the DPD
activity of the individuals tested was not measured.
In this study, we provide the first phenotype and specific geno-
type analysis of DPD in a colorectal cancer population. The
frequency of the splice site mutation and its association with low
DPD enzyme activity was studied. In addition, we describe two
mutations in the DPYD gene of a patient who experienced severe
5-FU-related toxicity and studied the frequency of these mutations
in colorectal cancer patients. Details of both the DPD genotype
and phenotype have provided valuable information regarding the
clinical application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
assays for prevention of 5-FU-associated toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient samples
The proband was a 65-year-old man who experienced severe
chemotherapy-induced toxicity after receiving 5 days of adjuvant
5-FU therapy after resection of a Duke's stage C carcinoma (Wei
et al, 1996). Samples were also obtained from 75 patients with
colorectal cancer who had received potentially curative resections
for colorectal cancer or were being treated for advanced disease at
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Twenty-six patients had Duke's stage
B, 40 Duke's stage C and nine Duke's stage D (aged 29-82 years).
The
majority
of patients
were randomized
in
the ongoing
497
498
SA Ridge et al
QUASAR trial, which involves the use of adjuvant 5-FU and
folinic acid-based chemotherapy. The remainder received a folinic
acid and bolus infusional 5-FU regimen for advanced metastatic
disease.
These
studies
were
approved by
the
local
ethical
committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Enzyme activity
DPD catalytic activity was measured in mononuclear cells from
20 ml of heparinized blood, using a previously described high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method for
the
detection
of
['4C]5-FU
metabolites
(McMurrough
and
McLeod, 1996).
Identification of mutations
The identification of the G to A mutation at a splice donor site in the
DPYD gene has been previously described (Wei et al,
1996).
Mutations at codons 534 and 543 of the DPYD gene were identified
by amplifying a 465-bp fragment of DPD cDNA using primers QF
(5'-CACTCCTATTGATCTGGTGGAC-3') and QR (5'-CATTCCT-
ClTTTCTCCCATGC-3') (Yokota et al, 1994). The PCR fragments
were cloned into the pTAg vector (R&D Systems) and sequenced
with primers flanking the cloning site (5'-SEQ 5'-GCTATGAC-
CATGATTACGCCAA-3'
and
3'SEQ
5'-TGTAAAACGACG-
GCCAGTGAA-3') according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Fluorescently labelled dideoxynucleotides were used and the prod-
ucts analysed by a ABI 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Screening for mutations
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using the Nucleon
II extraction method (Scotlab). The presence of a G to A mutation
at the splice donor site was detected using PCR to amplify a 258-
bp fragment from genomic DNA using primers DPDdelF2 (5'-
GAACCACCTCTGGCCCCACGTATG-3';
incorporates
a
Tail
site) and DPDdelR1 (5'-CAGCAAAGCAACTGGCAGATTC-3').

Amplification was carried out using 31 cycles of 94Â°C for 1 min,
58Â°C for 1 min and 72Â°C for 2 min. The presence of a mutation
was detected by digesting
10 jl of each sample with
TaiI
(Immunogen International) at 65Â°C for 4 h in 10 mm Tris-HCl pH
7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 100 mm potassium chloride and
analysing the products on a 2.5% agarose gel. The presence of the
G to A mutation at the splice site destroys a Tail site (ACGT to
ACAT), resulting in the production of 237-bp and 21-bp fragments
upon digestion. If the wild-type sequence is present, 129-bp, 109-
bp and 21-bp fragments are produced. Serine to asparagine muta-
tions at codon 534 of the DPYD gene were detected by amplifying
a 160-bp fragment from genomic DNA using primers QF and
DPDR7 (5'-CAAGAGAGAAAGTlTlGGTG-3'). The remaining
reaction conditions were as above but with 2 mm magnesium chlo-
ride. The presence of a mutation was detected by digesting 10 ,l
of each sample with MseI (New England Biolabs) at 37Â°C for 4 h
in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 50 mM
sodium chloride,
1 mM DTT, 100 ,ug ml-' bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and analysing on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The presence
of the G to A mutation at codon 534 creates an MseI site (TTAA),
resulting in the production of 136-bp and 24-bp fragments upon
digestion. Isoleucine to valine mutations at codon 543 of the
DPYD gene were detected by amplifying a 77-bp fragment from
genomic DNA using primers QF and RsaRl (5'-CGCTAGCAA-
GACCAAAAGGATGTA-3'), with the other reaction conditions
as for codon 534. Ten microlitres of each sample was digested for
4 h at 37Â°C with RsaI (NBL Gene Sciences) in 10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.8, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm DTT. Because of the
incorporation of a G at residue 22 in primer RsaRl (underlined), a
RsaI (GTAC) site is created if a A to G mutation is present at
codon 543. This results in the production of a 54-bp fragment upon
digestion. The wild-type 77-bp fragment and the 54-bp mutation-
specific fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10%
polyacrylamide gel. Controls with no DNA, known wild-type and
mutant DNAs were included in each analysis. The presence of
mutations was confirmed by sequencing PCR products directly
with the same primers used in the DNA amplification or by
cloning into the pTAg vector and sequencing using primers 5'SEQ
and 3'SEQ as described above.
RESULTS
Identification of DPYD mutations at codons 534 and 543
Amplification, cloning and sequencing the DPD cDNA fragments
from the proband demonstrated the presence of heterozygous
mutations that alter the coding sequence at codons 534 and 543. At
codon 534, a G to A transition (AGT to AAT) was detected and
would result in a serine to asparagine substitution. At codon 543,
an A to G transition (ATA to GTA) was detected and would result
in an isoleucine to valine substitution. The sequencing of cloned
PCR products indicated that the mutation at codon 543 was on the
same allele as the splice site mutation, whereas the codon 534
mutation was on the other allele (data not shown).
DPD enzyme activity
PBMNC DPD activity was detectable in all subjects analysed. DPD
activity was highly variable, with a 9.7-fold range of 42.6-412.3

We studied the frequency of mutations at codon 543 in 23 patients
with colorectal cancer (the first 20 collected and the three patients
with splice site or codon 534 mutations). We detected ten heterozy-
gous (DPD activity 44.1-335.4 pmol min-1 mg-' protein) and one
homozygous mutation (DPD activity 66.1 pmol min-1 mg-' protein)
(Figure 3), indicating a population allele frequency of 26%.
DISCUSSION
Low DPD activity has important implications for the toxicity of
fluoropyrimidine therapies (Harris et al, 1991; Wei et al, 1996). It
would therefore be advantageous to identify such individuals
before the administration of therapy. As routine measurement of
enzyme activity is not technically feasible in many centres, we
have investigated the use of DNA mutation analysis as an altema-
tive approach. We have identified two mutations in the DPD
cDNA of a patient with low enzyme activity, who experienced
severe toxicity after treatment with 5-FU. The frequency of these
mutations and their relationship to DPD enzyme activity were

determined for the first time in a cohort of colorectal cancer
patients. In addition, the frequency of a previously reported splice
site mutation (Vreken et al, 1996; Wei et al, 1996) has also been
studied. Mutations at the splice site, codon 534 and codon 543
were detected in 0.7%, 1.3% and 26% of alleles respectively. The
high frequency of mutations at codon 543 and the large range
in DPD enzyme activity (44.1-335.4 pmol min-' mg-' protein)
suggest that this is a common polymorphism, which is not itself
associated with low enzyme activity. Heterozygous mutations at
codon 534 were also not associated with low enzyme activity
(213.6 and 412.3 pmol min-' mg-'), suggesting that this mutation
also does not significantly effect the function of the enzyme alone.
Low DPD activity was found in the patient with the splice site
mutation. The DPD activity level detected was 84.5 pmol min-'
mg-' protein in the initial sample and 126 pmol min-' mg-' protein
in a second sample. These levels are similar to those described in a
number of patients who have experienced severe 5-FU-related
toxicity (Hoyau et al, 1993; Lyss et al, 1993; Beuzeboc et al, 1996)
but are higher than previously reported
in individuals with
heterozygous mutations at this splice donor site (Vreken et al,
1996; Wei et al, 1996). Although the reason for this is unclear, it is
possible that other mutations that effect DPD catalytic activity
may contribute to the lower activity observed in these individuals.
It is not possible to comment on the influence of the splice site
mutation on 5-FU toxicity in the individual from this study, as the
patient was randomized to receive observation alone. Current data
would suggest an increased risk of severe 5-FU-related toxicity
and that this should be considered in the event of disease relapse.
The mean DPD activity for the colorectal cancer patient popula-
tion was 210 pmol min-' mg-' protein with a 9.7-fold range and a
%CV of 37.2%. This is similar to that found in previous studies of
cancer patients (mean of 222 pmol min-' mg-' protein, 8.6-fold
range, %CV 37.8%) and healthy volunteers (mean of 189 pmol
min-' mg-' protein, 4.4-fold range, %CV 33.9%; Lu et al, 1993;
Etienne et al, 1994). It has been suggested that the cut-off value for
identification of suspected heterozygous DPD deficiency be set at
100 pmol min-' mg-' protein. In this study, seven patients fall
within this category, which is 9% of the total and much higher than
the previously predicted 3-4% of the population (Lu et al, 1993;
Etienne et al 1994). However, if we consider those patients who
have activity below the lower limit of the 95% distribution range
(< 60 pmol min-1 mg-' protein), only two patients (2.7%) fall into
this category. This may be a more useful limit for predicting those
at risk for toxicity. However, in the cohort studied here, the patient
with a splice site mutation had a DPD activity above this value and
this emphasizes the present difficulties associated with deter-
mining guidelines for identifying patients who may be at risk for
severe 5-FU toxicity. It is possible that the future identification of
more common inactivating mutations may clarify this.
The identification of two new mutations in this study and the
subsequent determination that neither alone are associated with low
enzyme activity highlight the importance of carrying out geno-
typing in the context of a population with known enzyme activity;
this also demonstrates that more than one mutation may be present
in an individual.
Studies of heterologously expressed mutant
proteins will be necessary to determine the specific effects of one or
more mutations on enzyme activity. Further investigations of the
seven individuals in this study with DPD enzyme activity below
100 pmol min-' mg-' protein may identify novel mutations that
improve the diagnostic use of PCR-based analysis for patients at
risk of 5-FU toxicity.

Spontaneous Splenic Rupture in Infectious Mononucleosis: A Review
Maryam M. Asgaria and Dennis G. Begos
Department ofSurgery, Yale University School ofMedicine, New Haven, Connecticut
(Received October 1, 1996; returned for revision January 29, 1997; accepted July 8, 1997)
Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare complication of infectious mononu-
cleosis (IM) occurring in 0.1-0.5 percent of patients with proven IM [1].
Although splenectomy has been advocated as the definitive therapy in the past,
numerous recent reports have documented favorable outcomes with non-opera-
tive management. A review of the literature suggests that non-operative man-
agement can be successful if appropriate criteria, such as hemodynamic stabil-
ity and transfusion requirements are applied in patient selection. We report the
case of a 36 year old man with infectious mononucleosis who had a spontaneous
splenic rupture and who was successfully managed by splenectomy. Based on
review of the literature, an approach to management of a spontaneously rup-
tured spleen secondary to IM is suggested.
INTRODUCTION
Infectious mononucleosis (IM)b is a common disease of young adults. The etiologic
agent, the ubiquitous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is transmitted primarily through exchange
of saliva but can also be transmitted with transfusion of blood and blood products. Primary
infections with the virus tend to occur at an early age and are usually subclinical.
Approximately 50 percent of pre-adolescent children seroconvert, that number climbing
to 90-95 percent by adulthood [2]. Of the people that become primarily infected with EBV
during the latter part of adolescence and young adulthood, 25-70 percent develop the clin-
ical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis.
IM is defined by a clinical triad of fever, pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy as well as
the presence of heterophil antibodies and atypical lymphocytes. It is a self-limited disease,
with pharyngitis resolving in 7-10 days, fever in 7-14 days and lymphadenopathy by about
3 weeks. Splenomegaly is noted clinically in approximately 50 percent of patients,
although by ultrasound, splenic enlargement has been shown to occur in as many as 100
percent of patients [3]. Approximately 90 percent of patients have hepatitis with mild ele-
vations in serum transaminases [4].
Although the disease usually runs a benign course, approximately 0.1-0.5 percent of
patients with IM suffer spontaneous splenic rupture [5]. Splenic rupture is typically her-
alded by abdominal pain. Signs of hypovolemia, such as tachycardia, orthostasis and syn-
cope, may also be present. The presence of Kehr's sign (left shoulder pain), occurs in
about 50 percent of splenic ruptures and is another clinical clue to alert the physician to
the possibility of splenic rupture. Diagnosis can be made by abdominal ultrasound or CT
scan.
In the face of hemodynamic instability, splenectomy is the treatment of choice.
However, when the patient is hemodynamically stable, management becomes a source
of debate. Though most authors still favor splenectomy, recently, several authors have

Asgari and Begos:
Spontaneous splenic rupture
advocated non-operative management as a viable alternative [4, 6]. We report the case
of a 36 year old previously healthy male with spontaneous splenic rupture and infectious
mononucleosis. The patient presented with hemodynamic instability and was success-
fully managed surgically.
CASE REPORT
M.P., a 36 year old male with a history significant for peptic ulcer disease, presented
to the Emergency Department with a four-day history of fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea and
anorexia. On the day of admission, he noted the onset of acute abdominal pain localized
to the epigastric area without any radiation. The pain was described as constant and
severe. The patient experienced a syncopal episode that morning while attempting to raise
himself from his bed, which led him to seek medical attention. The patient denied any his-
tory of recent trauma.
Upon his arrival at the Emergency Department, the patient complained of moderate
abdominal pain. He had a temperature of 99.8Â°F, pulse of 101 and supine blood pressure
of 80/38. He was noted not to have any evidence of pharyngitis or lymphadenopathy. His
abdominal exam revealed tenderness to percussion and palpation with involuntary guard-
ing in the upper abdomen and rebound tenderness localized to the epigastic region. His
extremities were cool with faint distal pulses.
Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 26,500 cells/ml with 30 percent
atypical lymphocytes and a hematocrit of 32.7. Serum transaminases were slightly elevat-
ed with an alanine aminotransferase value of 294 ufl and an aspartate aminotransferase
value of 172 u/I. Serum alkaline phosphatase was also elevated at 326 ull.
The patient's atypical lymphocytosis, consistent withIM, combined with his clinical
presentation of peritonitis and hypotension in the absense of a history of trauma, suggest-
ed the tentative diagnosis of a spontaneous splenic rupture. He was started on crystalloids
for fluid replacement but was not given any blood transfusions. While awaiting a CT scan
to confirm his diagnosis, the patient had several episodes of marked hypotension despite
aggressive fluid replacement. Because of his hemodynamic instability, the decision was
made to treat the patient surgically. At laparotomy, there was a large amount of fresh and
clotted blood in the abdomen, and the spleen was large and congested. It had a 6 cm lin-
ear laceration involving the hilum, as well as a subcapsular hematoma on the lateral sur-
face. The spleen was removed without incident and no other intra-abdominal pathology
was noted.
Pathologic examination revealed an enlarged spleen, weighing 310 g. The splenic
parenchyma showed marked infiltration with a heterogeneous population of small lym-
phocytes, activated lymphoid cells, immunoblasts, plasma cells and histiocytes. Marker
studies demonstrated the majority of lymphoid cells to be of T-immunophenotype com-
patible with the clinical diagnosis of an active EBV infection. In situ hybridization for
EBV with EBER oligonucleoprobes was positive for the presence of the virus.c A
Monospot test obtained at the time of admission was later confirmed as positive for infec-
tious mononucleosis.
c EBERs are nonpolyadenylated RNA polymerase III transcripts that are abundant in EBV-infected
cells. The EBER oligonucleoprobes are antisense probes that hybridize to EBER viral RNAs in clin-
ical specimens. In situ hybridization with these probes is considered to be a very sensitive technique
for detecting EBV immortalized cell lines due to the high copy number of the target within infect-
ed cells [7, 8].

Asgari and Begos:
Spontaneous splenic rupture
DISCUSSION
Splenic involvement in IM is common: being clinically evident in 25-50 percent and
detectable on ultrasound examination in as many as 100 percent of patients [3]. Grossly,
the spleen appears boggy and edematous, often with lifting of the splenic capsule forming
a subcapsular hematoma. Histologically, the red pulp appears congested with lymphocyt-
ic and atypical lymphoid cell infiltration. This infiltration extends to include the capsule,
supporting trabeculae, and blood vessel walls of the spleen. As a result, the splenic cap-
sule and fibrous support network may become fragmented and dissoluted, compromising
the spleen's architecture and facilitating rupture.
Etiologic factors that may induce spontaneous splenic rupture include an acute
increase in portal venous pressure such as that accompanying a Valsalva maneuver or any
sudden compression of the enlarged spleen secondary to contraction of the diaphragm or
abdominal wall [9]. The spleen is most vulnerable to rupture approximately 10-21 days
after onset of clinical symptoms of IM when capsular and trabecular changes are most
pronounced. In our case, the spleen spontaneously ruptured 4 days after the onset of clin-
ical symptoms of IM. Early rupture, though unusual, has been reported as early as 3 days
following the onset of symptoms [10].
Spontaneous splenic rupture secondary to IM was first reported in the literature by
King in 1941 [11]. Five years later, Smith and Custer [12] demonstrated a mortality rate
of approximately 30 percent. Although this mortality rate was based on only seven cases,
it was so alarmingly high that it led physicians to view splenectomy as the treatment of
choice for the disease. Other forms of treatment were mostly overlooked until more
recently, when close examination of the cases revealed that the survival rate for ""true""
spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR) was higher than previously estimated [9]. Rutkow
reviewed 107 cases of SSR reported in the world literature up to 1976 and suggested that
only 18 of those cases were ""true"" spontaneous ruptures, occurring in patients with a well-
established histologic and serologic diagnosis of IM. The other 89 cases, when examined
with scrutiny, failed to fulfill criteria for true SSR in that 1) a history of traumatic injury
could not be definitively ruled out; 2) the diagnosis of IM was not serologically con-
firmed; and 3) multi-system disease was present, suggesting the possibility of pathologi-
cal as opposed to spontaneous rupture. Of the 18 true SSR cases, the survival rate was 100
percent. Though this estimated survival rate is more likely to be a closer approximation to
the actual survival rate, it is, however, slightly elevated as compared with recent reports
that have documented cases of sudden death due to true SSR fulfilling the above criteria
[2, 13, 14]. Nevertheless, the higher estimated survival rate prompted interest in investi-
gating spleen-sparing methods for treating SSR.
Most authors continue to advocate splenectomy as the treatment of choice in SSR [ 1,
10, 15-19]. They argue that there is no strong evidence that non-operative management is
safe in the short-term or beneficial in the long-run. The sudden death of patients prior to
any medical assistance illustrates the potential morbidity associated with non-surgical
management [1]. They maintain that splenectomy is a safe procedure with low morbidity
and mortality and that, most importantly, it is definitive. They cite the fact that, unlike the
normal spleen which can readily repair itself after trauma, the diseased spleen does not
possess the same reparative capabilities due to the changes in the basic framework of the
organ. The capacity of the spleen to regain its immunologic function in patients managed
nonoperatively after a spontaneous splenic rupture has yet to be determined.
In previous decades, splenectomy was unarguably the treatment of choice for splenic
rupture because the spleen's immunologic function was obscure. It wasn't until 1952
when a landmark article by King and Schumaker [20] suggested that children who under-
went splenectomies were at greater risk for developing sepsis, thus elucidating the entity
177
Asgari and Begos:
Spontaneous splenic rupture
of post-splenectomy sepsis. Post-splenectomy sepsis is a potentially lethal complication
of splenectomy with a mortality rate of 50 percent to 80 percent [21]. While the incidence
of post-splenectomy sepsis is well-documented in the pediatric population [22], its inci-
dence in teenagers and young adults, who are at greatest risk for IM, is less clear. O'Neal
and McDonald [23] attempted to ascertain the risk of post-splenectomy sepsis in the
asplenic young adult population by following a group of 256 asplenic adults aged 16-91
for a mean observation period of 45 months. The incidence of mortality from fulminant
sepsis was 2.7 percent, a prevalence 540 times that of the normal adult population. This
study was performed prior to the availability of the pneumococcal vaccine, which has con-
siderably reduced the risk of sepsis secondary to pneumococcus. Since the vaccine is only
between 60 percent to 100 percent effective, it has not eliminated the risk of pneumococ-
cal sepsis [21]. More recent reports have estimated the risk of post-splenectomy sepsis to
be less than 1 percent in patients who have undergone splenectomy for trauma [16, 24].
The importance of the spleen in immunologic function was further elucidated with
studies showing that patients with splenectomies had reduced serum IgM levels, an inabil-
ity to switch from IgM to IgG synthesis following secondary immunization [25] as well
as a decreased response to various antigens [26]. The discovery of the spleen's role in
immunologic function fostered changing attitudes favoring splenic conservation. Splenic
conservation involves either splenorrhaphy or non-operative management. Successful
splenorrhaphy has not been reported in IM-induced SSR rupture. There is one report of a
successful splenorrhaphy after a traumatic splenic rupture in a patient with IM [27] in
which a 3 cm laceration was repaired with an omental flap. More recently, an attempt at
splenorrhaphy was made in a patient with SSR due to IM but was abandoned secondary
to splenic disintegration during repair [28]. Many surgeons are unwilling to perform
splenorrhaphy in IM due to the inherent fragility of the diseased spleen, which may ren-
der it more vulnerable to further hemorrhage following repair.
The advantages of non-operative management are that it eliminates the risk of post-
splenectomy sepsis and saves the patient from potential perioperative complications.
However, nonoperative management is not without risk. The patient may be prone to
delayed splenic rupture and as a result, may require a longer period of follow-up with
slower return to normal activities. The spleen can remain susceptible to rupture after all
clinical, hematologic and serologic criteria document resolution of IM [9]. Johnson et al.
[29] reported two patients with SSR occurring 4 and 7 weeks after the initial onset of IM.
MacLean [30] reported a patient with recurrent spontaneous splenic rupture 69 days after
hospitalization for splenic rupture secondary to IM. Since the length of time during which
a patient with IM is at risk for splenic rupture remains uncertain, nonoperative manage-
ment requires months of follow-up as well as restriction of activity for a 2-3 month peri-
od [9, 29]. This is often poorly tolerated in the young adult population.
Additionally, conservatively managed patients may require multiple blood transfu-
sions with the attendant risk of viral transmissions. For viruses that can cause chronic, life-
threatening infections, such as the hepatitis viruses and HIV, the results could be fatal.
Fortunately, with the current screening of blood and blood products, that risk is mini-
mized. For example, the risk of post-transfusion transmission of hepatitis C, which prior
to anti-HCV screening in 1990 was estimated to be as high as 13 percent, is now as low
as 0.1 percent [31]. Although the current estimation of the post-transfusion risk for trans-
mission of viruses is markedly reduced, the inherent risk, albeit small, continues to per-
sist.
There have been a total of 19 reported cases of successful non-operative management
of patients with SSR and IM (Table 1), suggesting that non-operative management is justi-
fied in select patients. What criteria can be used to select the appropriate patients? In cases
of adult blunt splenic trauma, Longo et al. [38] proposed parameters predicting successful

outcome as follows: (1) hemodynamic stability; (2) normal level of consciousness (3);
under 50 years old; (4) transfusion requirements of less than 4 units of blood; (5) early res-
olution of splenic defects on imaging studies; and (6) rapid resolution of post-traumatic
ileus. Some of the same parameters are useful in predicting a successful outcome in SSR.
Few surgeons would advocate non-operative management in the face of hemodynamic
instability or loss of consciousness. Since IM affects mostly the young adult population,
age limitations are not useful. In comparing the 19 cases of successful outcomes of non-
operative management to those that have failed, the most predictive variable appears to be
the number of transfusions required to achieve hemodynamic stability.

In the cases reviewed, 16 of 19 patients who were successfully managed non-opera-
tively required up to 2 units of blood to maintain hemodynamic stability. Ten required no
transfusions [1, 13, 21, 19, 29, 33, 36], 2 required 1 unit [37] and four required 2 units [1,
32, 33, 37]. One patient required 8 units and subsequently developed shortness of breath

and laryngospasm requiring intubation [35], suggesting that non-operative management
requiring numerous transfusions may lead to further complications.
In contrast, the available data show that most patients who failed non-operative ther-
apy did so because of persistent hemodynamic instability requiring 5 or more units of
blood (Table 2). The one exception is the patient reported by MacLean [30] who was ini-
tially successfully managed with nonoperative treatment. Upon admission, she stabilized
hemodynamically with administration of 2 units of packed red blood cells and was dis-
charged after 17 days with no complications. However, nine days later, she suffered blunt
trauma to her abdomen at which point she developed recurrent left shoulder pain. This
pain did not resolve and ultimately led to a laparotomy, which indicated delayed splenic
rupture. This case suggests that the spleen may remain susceptible to delayed rupture for
several months, though the exact length of time has yet to be determined. Thus, non-oper-
ational management should be reserved for patients who can tolerate strict restrictions on
activity.

SUMMARY
Spontaneous splenic rupture is the most common fatal complication of IM. A high
index of suspicion is necessary on the part of the physician to diagnose the disease and
initiate appropriate management. Although splenectomy is still the treatment of choice for
the majority of patients with spontaneous splenic rupture, carefully selected patients may
benefit from non-operative management. Previous reports have failed to state how patients
were selected for non-operative management. We propose selecting those patients with
180

SSR who require no more than 2 units of blood to maintain hemodynamic stability. Any
such guidelines, however, would need to be investigated with a retrospective study to fur-
ther analyze patients treated both surgically and non-operatively. Establishment of such
guidelines for decision making could facilitate recognition of the point at which non-oper-
ative therapy fails and surgical intervention is indicated.

Processivity of the Motor
Protein Kinesin Requires Two Heads
William O. Hancock and Jonathon Howard
 
Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7290
Abstract. 
 
A single kinesin molecule can move for hun-
dreds of steps along a microtubule without dissociating. 
One hypothesis to account for this processive move-
ment is that the binding of kinesinâs two heads is coor-
dinated so that at least one head is always bound to the 
microtubule. To test this hypothesis, the motility of a 
full-length single-headed kinesin heterodimer was ex-
amined in the in vitro microtubule gliding assay. As the 
surface density of single-headed kinesin was lowered, 
there was a steep fall both in the rate at which microtu-
bules landed and moved over the surface, and in the 
distance that microtubules moved, indicating that indi-
vidual single-headed kinesin motors are not processive 
and that some four to six single-headed kinesin mole-
cules are necessary and sufficient to move a microtu-
bule continuously. At high ATP concentration, individ-
ual single-headed kinesin molecules detached from 
microtubules very slowly (at a rate less than one per 
second), 100-fold slower than the detachment during 
two-headed motility. This slow detachment directly 
supports a coordinated, hand-over-hand model in 
which the rapid detachment of one head in the dimer is 
contingent on the binding of the second head.
C

kinesin is a motor protein that trans-
ports membrane-bound vesicles and organelles
along microtubules in neurons and other cells (for
review see Bloom and Endow, 1995). Although the bio-
chemical mechanism underlying this directed motility is
not fully understood, it is thought that each time the motor
hydrolyzes a molecule of ATP it steps through a distance
of 8 nm to the next binding site lying closer to the plus end
of the microtubule (Ray et al., 1993; Svoboda et al., 1993;
Hua et al., 1997; Schnitzer and Block, 1997). An unusual
and important property of kinesin is that it is processive:
an individual molecule can move continuously for a dis-
tance up to several microns along the surface of a microtu-
bule, taking hundreds of steps without dissociating (Howard
et al., 1989; Block et al., 1990). Processivity has been con-
firmed by high resolution single molecule experiments
showing that kinesin can move hundreds of nanometers
even against loads up to several piconewtons (Svoboda
and Block, 1994; MeyhÃ¶fer and Howard, 1995), and by
biochemical experiments showing that kinesin hydrolyzes
 
z
 
100 ATP molecules per encounter with a microtubule
(Hackney, 1995). Processive motility appears to be an ad-
aptation to kinesinâs function as an organelle transporter:
since few motors can fit on the surface of a small organelle
or vesicle, it is important that each motor remains bound
to the microtubule for as long as possible to ensure that
cargo is transported quickly and reliably over long distances.
To move processively it is essential that kinesin remains
bound to the microtubule throughout the motion, because
if the motor detaches it will quickly diffuse away. The
structure of kinesin suggests a possible mechanism by
which kinesin can maintain attachment with the microtu-
bule even while it steps. Kinesin is a multimeric protein
with two identical globular âheadâ domains, a long coiled-
coil rod responsible for dimerization, and a small âtailâ do-
main (Bloom et al., 1988; Hirokawa et al., 1989; Yang et
al., 1989). The heads are the motor domains: they contain
the microtubule- and nucleotide-binding sites and they
suffice for motility (Yang et al., 1990; Stewart et al., 1993;
Berliner et al., 1995). The tail is thought to be an associa-
tion domain that hitches the motor to its appropriate cargo
(Coy and Howard, 1994). In view of kinesinâs two heads, a
simple model to account for processivity is that the motor
moves in a hand-over-hand fashion so that the detachment
of one head from the microtubule is contingent on the at-
tachment of the other (see Fig. 1; Howard et al., 1989;
Schnapp et al., 1990). In this way there is always one head
bound to prevent the motor from dissociating. An addi-
tional feature of this model is that it provides a ready ex-
planation for how kinesin can reach its next binding site, a
distance 8 nm away, with heads that are themselves only
 
z
 
8-nm long (Kull et al., 1996); the second head may me-
chanically amplify a smaller motion of the attached head,
thereby extending the motorâs reach.
A hand-over-hand mechanism implies that the two

heads move in a coordinated manner. One type of coordi-
nation has been observed in biochemical experiments that
show the attachment of the second head to the microtu-
bule is contingent upon the binding of ATP to the bound
first head (Hackney, 1994; Ma and Taylor, 1997). These
findings are incorporated into the model of Fig. 1. How-
ever, there is no direct evidence for the essential type
of coordination required by the hand-over-hand model,
namely that the release of the first head from the microtu-
bule be contingent upon the binding of the second head.
Although the hand-over-hand model is attractive, it is
difficult to reconcile with two findings. First, the atomic
structure of dimeric kinesin with bound ADP shows that
the two heads are rotated by 
 
z

 with respect to each
other, and they cannot simultaneously bind to the polar
microtubule unless the dimer is highly strained (Kozielski
et al., 1997). This observation has led to the proposal that
the motion is purely one headed and that the second head
is a passenger or a crutch that plays no active role. Second,
there are kinesin-related proteins, KIF1A and KIF1B,
which, like conventional kinesin, are thought to be vesicle
and organelle transporters, but which are monomeric
(Nangaku et al., 1994; Okada et al., 1995). The existence of
these motors shows that a two-headed structure is not es-
sential for organelle motility, and raises the question of
how monomeric motors could maintain contact with the
microtubule while they move.
The hand-over-hand model makes several clear predic-
tions. First, a single-headed molecule, in which one of the
heads has been removed, should not be processive. Sec-
ond, a single single-headed molecule should have a high
affinity for the microtubule, even though it does not move,
because there is no second head to induce its detachment.
And third, we might expect single-headed molecules to
move more slowly due to the loss of the mechanical ampli-
fication provided by the other head, just as myosin moves
more slowly when its regulatory domain, also thought to
act as a mechanical lever, is weakened (Lowey et al., 1993)
or shortened (Anson et al., 1996; Uyeda et al., 1996).
In the present work, we have tested these predictions by
examining the motility of single-headed kinesin in micro-
tubule gliding assays. To facilitate direct comparison to the
two-headed wild-type protein, we have used a construct
that retains all the rod and tail domains, including the
âneckâ or dimerization domain comprising amino acids
345â380 adjacent to the motor domain (Huang et al.,
1994). Because the rod and tail portions are the same as
those in the wild-type protein, we presume that the single-
headed protein attaches to the glass surfaces used in the
motility assays in the same way that the wild-type protein
attaches. A distinct advantage of our construct over its
complement, the monomeric motor domain, is that the lat-
ter protein on its own shows no detectable motility (Vale
et al., 1996). Thus, even though the motor domain is an
ATPase (Huang and Hackney, 1994), it may not be a mo-
tor, perhaps due to the absence of a neck or even because
it is monomeric; any discussion of its processivity is there-
fore moot. In all cases, the motility of the motor domain
has been contingent upon the addition of an artificial tail
(Stewart et al., 1993; Berliner et al., 1995; Vale et al., 1996;
Inoue et al., 1997), which may substitute for the neck or
may induce dimerization in solution or on the surface, es-
pecially when surface attachment is mediated by the multi-
valent protein streptavidin.
Our approach to measuring the number of single-
headed molecules required for motility is to determine
how the motor activity depends on the surface density of
motor molecules in an in vitro motility assay. The ratio-
nale of the approach, which has been used widely in bio-
chemistry and biophysics (Hill, 1913; Hecht et al., 1942), is
that if only one molecule is necessary, then the activity is
expected to decrease gradually as the density is reduced,
whereas if a large number of molecules are required, then
the activity is expected to decrease abruptly at a density
that fails to provide the requisite number of motors. In this
way we have determined the minimum number of single-
headed molecules required for continuous motility.
Materials and Methods
Construction of Coexpression Plasmid
 
Single-headed kinesin heterodimers were made by coexpressing full-
length 
 
Drosophila
 
 kinesin heavy chain (Yang et al., 1989) with a decapi-
tated kinesin heavy chain consisting of the rod and tail domains but lack-
ing the 340-residue head domain (see Fig. 2). To increase expression levels
of wild-type kinesin, the 5
 
9
 
 end of the gene (pET-kin [Yang et al., 1990]),
generously provided by L.S.B. Goldstein (University of California, San
Diego, CA) was altered to restore the correct NH
 
2
 
-terminal amino acid
sequence and reduce possible secondary structure of the message. The
DNA sequence and corresponding amino acids were changed from:
to:
The decapitated kinesin gene was created using PCR-based mutagene-
sis. The sequence coding the NH
 
2
 
-terminal 340 residues was deleted and
then a COOH-terminal sequence coding hexa-histidine (his)
 
1
 
 was added.
The atomic structure of the dimeric rat kinesin shows that the coiled-coil
neck domain of 
 
Drosophila
 
 kinesin begins at Ala345 (corresponding to
Ala339 in the rat; Kozielski et al., 1997), consistent with secondary struc-
ture predictions (Howard, 1996). Thus, our single-headed heterodimer
contains the entire neck domain. Physical measurements show that the
340-amino acid head domain does not dimerize in solution (Huang et al.,
1994; Correia et al., 1995; Young et al., 1995); because the decapitated
heavy chain contains all the dimerization regions, it is unlikely that our
heterodimers form higher order oligomers via uncomplemented dimeriza-

Figure 1. The hand-over-hand model. It is postulated that the un-
binding of the kinesinâs first head (unshaded) in step iv occurs
only after the binding of the second head (shaded) in step iii. In
this way at least one head remains bound to the microtubule at all
times. Also shown are the likely nucleotide states of the two
heads during the motion (see text). The results presented in this
paper indicate that the structure with both heads attached (iii) is
highly strained and that this strain accelerates the release of the
trailing head.

After PCR mutagenesis, the decapitated kinesin gene was digested
with NheI and BamHI (molecular biology enzymes were purchased from
New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly MA; Life Technologies, Inc., Gaith-
ersburg, MD; or Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN;
all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO, unless otherwise noted), and then ligated into a pET5 plasmid
(Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). The sequences of the 5
 
9
 
-234 bases and the
3
 
9
 
-115 bases were confirmed using a sequencer (model ABI 373A; Perkin-
Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA) and the intervening sequence between the
SfiI and RsrII restriction sites was replaced by the corresponding se-
quence from the full-length kinesin gene to avoid any errors introduced by
the Taq polymerase used in the PCR reaction.
To generate a coexpression plasmid (see Fig. 2 
 
A
 
), the decapitated ki-
nesin gene, along with its T7 promoter and ribosome binding site, was cut
out of the pET5 plasmid using SphI and EcoRI. The pET-kin plasmid was
then linearized using SphI and then the decapitated gene ligated into the
vector using a SphI to EcoRI adapter. This ligation resulted in a coexpres-
sion plasmid with the decapitated kinesin gene upstream of the full-length
kinesin gene, with each gene having its own T7 promoter and ribosome
binding site. Neither gene contained a transcriptional stop sequence, so
the message was probably polycistronic.
Protein Expression and Purification
 
The coexpression plasmid was transfected into 
 
Escherichia coli
 
 strain
BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Inc.), a bacterial stock was grown in Luria-Bertani
medium supplemented with 100 
 
m
 
g/ml ampicillin, and then 2-ml aliquots
were frozen and stored at

dium were inoculated with a stock aliquot, grown at 37
 
8
 
C in the presence
of 100 
 
m
 
g/ml ampicillin to an OD of 0.5 per cm at 600 nm and then protein
expression was induced by adding 0.4 mM isopropyl B-
 
p
 
-thiogalactopyra-
noside and incubating for 3 h at 20

C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifug-
ing for 6 min at 6,000 
 
g
 
, and were then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM
sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 5 mM 
 
b
 
-mercapto-
ethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored
at

C. After thawing, bacteria were lysed by twice passing through a
French press (model FAO73; Spectronics Aminco, Inc., Rochester, NY)
at 19,000 psi. in the presence of 1 mM PMSF. The bacterial lysate was then
centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 
 
g
 
 to remove cell debris and insoluble
protein. As seen in Fig. 3, lane 
 
2
 
, the expression level of the decapitated
kinesin peptide was approximately fivefold higher than the full-length ki-
nesin heavy chain; ideally this difference will maximize the formation of
single-headed heterodimer over two-headed homodimer.
His-tagged kinesin was purified on a 40-ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)
agarose column (QIAGEN, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). Column buffers con-
tained the following: 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl
 
2
 
, 100 
 
m
 
M MgATP, 5 mM 
 
b
 
-mercaptoethanol (added just before us-
ing), and either 60 mM (wash buffer) or 500 mM (elution buffer) imida-
zole, pH 7.0. To avoid loss of activity and prevent aggregation, kinesin was
kept in 100 
 
m
 
M MgATP at all times.
The column was preincubated with wash buffer and then the bacterial
supernatant was loaded onto the column, followed by five column vol of
wash buffer to remove contaminating bacterial proteins. The protein ab-
sorbance at 280 nm was monitored to confirm the wash was complete. Sin-
gle-headed kinesin was eluted from the column by a step elution. Gradi-
ent elutions were also found to work, with the his-tagged kinesin eluting at
 
z
 
150 mM imidazole. A gel of the elution fractions is seen in Fig. 3.
Sucrose DensityâGradient Centrifugation
 
Motility experiments on the Ni column elution fractions showed that de-
spite the lack of a his tag on the two-headed kinesin species, there was a
small contamination of two-headed kinesin in the elution fractions. To
separate single-headed kinesin from the contaminating two-headed mo-
tors, the three different kinesin species (zero-head, one-head, and two-head
with predicted molecular weights of 148, 185, and 222 kD, respectively)
were separated by sedimentation rate using sucrose densityâgradient cen-
trifugation.
In preparation for the centrifugation step, the Ni column elution peak
was concentrated by filling a 30â40 cm length of dialysis tubing (50,000 kD

protein sample was spun for 5 min in an airfuge (model E4; Beckman In-

Sephadex G25 M column (Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden),
the supernatant was exchanged into 25A25 buffer (Huang and Hackney,
1994) (25 mM

 and 1 mM dithiothreitol. After degassing the solu-
tions and cooling to 4

C, a 5â20% (wt/wt) sucrose density gradient was
formed in a 12-ml Ultra-Clear tube (Beckman, Instrs.). To calculate sedi-
mentation rates, proteins with known sedimentation values (carbonic anhy-
drase, 3.2; BSA, 4.4; alcohol dehydrogenase, 7.6; 
 
b
 
-amylase, 8.9 S, respec-
tively) were run either as internal standards or in a parallel tube. After the
gradient was formed, 150â200 
 
m
 
l of the concentrated protein sample was
carefully layered onto the gradient and then the sample was spun in an ul-
tracentrifuge (model L8-80M; Beckman Instrs.) for 20â30 h at 41,000 rpm
in a swinging bucket rotor (model SW-41, Beckman Instrs., Fullerton, CA).
The gradient was drained by positive displacement using 50% (wt/wt)
sucrose solution. This method achieved significantly better results than
draining the gradient by gravity through the bottom of the tube. An
adapter, made from the tip of a 5-ml syringe, was fit to the top of the tube,
connected to a fraction collector, and then 
 
z
 
40 fractions of vol. of 300-

each were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and motility assay. To
quantitate the concentration of full-length and decapitated kinesin peptide in
each fraction, the Coomassie blueâstained gels were scanned using a 0.2-OD
filter to reach the linear range of the scanner (model PS-2400X; UMAX
Data Systems, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan), and then the band intensity was
digitally integrated using National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image ver-
sion 1.57 (Bethesda, MD) and compared to a BSA standard on the same gel.
The separation of the various kinesin species as determined by SDS-
PAGE is seen in Fig. 4. A prominent peak of decapitated kinesin heavy
chain is seen followed by a smaller peak that coincides with a peak of full-
length kinesin heavy chain. These two peaks are interpreted as the head-
less homodimer and single-headed heterodimer, respectively. By compar-
ing the sedimentation rate to the protein standards, the values of 4.4 for
headless kinesin, 5.4 for single-headed kinesin, and 6.8 S for two-headed
kinesin, respectively, were calculated. Results from motility assays were
consistent with the gel results: in the peak headless fraction (see Fig. 4,
 
fraction 20
 
) no microtubules stuck to the surface; in the peak single-
headed fraction (see Fig. 4, 
 
fraction 23
 
) many microtubules landed on the
surface and moved at slow velocities; and in the expected peak two-
headed fraction (see Fig. 4, 
 
fractions 26 and above
 
) there was considerable
movement at speeds similar to the wild-type speed.
The single-headed fractions (see Fig. 4, 
 
fractions 22â24
 
) were divided
into 50-
 
m
 
l aliquots, augmented with 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 0.5 mg/ml casein
to prevent protein adsorption to the sides of the tubes (in some experi-
ments this was done immediately after thawing on the day of the motility
experiment), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at

C.
Wild-type (two-headed) kinesin was expressed and purified in an iden-
tical manner as single-headed kinesin. Briefly, a full-length 
 
Drosophila
 
 ki-
nesin construct containing a COOH-terminal his tag was bacterially ex-
pressed, purified on an identical Ni column, further isolated by sucrose
densityâgradient centrifugation, and then quantified by gel scanning.
In Vitro Motility Assays
 
Motility assays were performed as previously described (Howard et al.,
1993) using BRB80 buffer (80 mM Pipes, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl
 
2
 
, pH
6.9) for all solutions. Briefly, the glass surfaces of the flow cell were
blocked by 0.5 mg/ml casein solution for 3 min, and then the motor-con-
taining solution (that included 100 
 
m
 
g/ml MgATP and 0.2 mg/ml casein)
was flowed into the cell and the motors were allowed to adhere to the
glass for 5 min. After this, motility solution (rhodamine-labeled bovine
brain microtubules at 32 nM tubulin dimer, 1 mM ATP, 10

cose, 0.02 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.008 mg/ml catalase, and 0.5%

captoethanol) was added. Microtubules in the motility solution were
sheared by twice passing through a 30-gauge needle at a flow rate of 100
 
m

Motor Densities and Their Uncertainties
 
The surface density of motors was calculated from the motor concentra-
tion and the geometry of the flow cell. Control experiments demonstrated
that 
 
.
 
90% of the motors adsorbed to the glass surface during the 5-min
incubation. Flow cells were 100-
 
m
 
m deep (made with number zero cover-
slips as spacers), and then the motors were assumed to distribute evenly
between the top and bottom glass surfaces. Densities are expressed as the
number of motor molecules per squared micrometer of surface area,
where one wild-type molecule has two heads and one single-headed mole-
cule has one head. To vary the motor density, motor stock solution was di-
luted into BRB80 supplemented with 100 
 
m
 
M MgATP and 0.2 mg/ml
casein immediately before adding to the flow cell.
Uncertainty in the motor density was due to several factors, the largest
of which was uncertainty in protein concentration as determined by gel
scanning. For two-headed kinesin, the relative SEM was 25%, whereas for
single-headed kinesin it was 30%. In addition to these random errors,
there was a systematic error due to inactive protein. When the concentra-
tion of wild-type kinesin adsorbed to glass surfaces was measured from
the number of nucleotide binding sites (Coy, D., personal communica-
tion), the concentration was only 
 
z
 
50% of that determined by compari-
son to BSA standards as described above. Since this latter measure has
been found to be a good estimate of the protein concentration of native
kinesin (Hackney, 1988), it is possible that only about half of our recombi-
nant, wild-type protein is active. If the single-headed protein has a higher
proportion of active protein, then the true density of single-headed kine-
sin might be twice that of wild-type kinesin. These uncertainties are taken
into account when the motor activities of the two proteins are compared
in the Results.
Video Analysis
 
Motility experiments were recorded on standard VHS videotape for later
analysis. Displacement and velocity data were collected by recording the
digitized position of the front end of moving microtubules using MEA-
SURE hardware (M. Walsh Electronics, San Dimas, CA) and software
generously provided by S. Block (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ).
Microtubule lengths and distances moved were measured directly from
the video monitor by tracing the microtubule position on a transparent
plastic sheet placed over the video screen. The threshold of detectable
movement from the video was 0.3 
 
m
 
m.
Figure 4. Separation of kinesin species by sucrose densityâgradi-
ent centrifugation. The concentrations of full-length kinesin
heavy chain and decapitated kinesin heavy chain peptides in each
fraction were estimated from scans of Coomassie blueâstained
SDS-PAGE gels. Inferred positions of the peak headless and sin-
gle-headed fractions are highlighted. There was no evidence for
a two-headed kinesin peak; the expected position of the two-
headed peak is based on separate centrifugation experiments
with pure wild-type kinesin. Fractions 22â24 were used as single-
headed kinesin samples for motility assays.

Theory
 
To quantitate the minimum number of single-headed motors required for
motility, we considered models of microtubules landing on and moving
across kinesin-coated surfaces. Suppose that the motors are adsorbed at
random locations on a planar surface and that for a microtubule to suc-
cessfully land on the surface and move, at least 
 
n
 
 motors must be engaged.
We assume that the landing is a sequential process with the microtubule
first binding to one motor on the surface, then to another, and so on until
 
n
 
 motors are engaged and the microtubule is able to move continuously.
The landing rate, 
 
R
 
n
 
, is expected to depend on the density of motors, 
 
r
 
, ac-
cording to
(1)
The individual bracketed terms reflect the probability that there is at least
one motor within each area 1/
 
r
 
i
 
 that characterizes the 
 
i
 
th step in the land-
ing process, and the 
 
Z
 
i
 
âs are constants that do not depend on density. The
product is formed because each of the 
 
n
 
 steps must be successful for the
landing to be successful. For example, the first step corresponds to the col-
lision with the surface, 1-exp(-
 
r
 
/
 
r
 
1
 
) is the probability that there is at least
one motor in the area 1/
 
r
 
1
 
 (expected to be of the order of the length of the
microtubule times twice the âreachâ of the motor), and then 
 
Z
 
1
 
 depends
on the collision rate and the fraction of collisions that are successful. In
simplifying the model, it can be shown that when all the 
 
r
 
i
 
âs are equal, the
landing rate depends most steeply on the density (Howard, J., manuscript
in preparation). Hence, a lower limit for 
 
n
 
 will be obtained when the land-
ing rate data are fit with the equation
(2)
where 
 
Z
 
 is a parameter that incorporates collision of microtubules with
the surface and 
 
r
 
0
 
 corresponds to the surface area over which motors in-
teract with a microtubule. Eq. 2 yields a lower bound for 
 
n
 
 that is indepen-
dent of the precise details of the landing process.
Suppose that to continue to move, there must always be at least 
 
n
 
 mo-
tors interacting with the microtubule. Because of the random placement
of motors on the surface, it is possible that the microtubule, though ini-
tially moving, will reach a place on the coverglass that has too few motors
to support motility and will stop. The probability that it will move a dis-
tance greater than or equal to its own length before it reaches such a place
on the surface and stops is

The models of Eqs. 2 and 3 were fit to the landing rate and distance
moved curves, respectively, using the LevenbergâMarquardt algorithm
(Igor; Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The data points were weighted
by the SEM. For the landing rate curves, the standard errors were calcu-
lated as the sum of the errors associated with the counting statistics (SEM

The sum was performed by adding the variances. For the distance-moved
curves, the error bars were calculated from counting statistics alone: SEM
5 [f(12f)/n]1/2 where f (? 0 or 1) is the measured fraction of microtubules
that moved more than their own length and n is the number of observa-
tions; SEM 5 1/n if f 5 0 or 1.

assay.
Speed and Character of Microtubule Movement
When adsorbed to glass surfaces at medium or high den-
sity, single-headed kinesin induced microtubule gliding,
though the speed was lower and the motion less smooth
than that induced by wild-type kinesin (Fig. 5). During pe-
riods of smooth movement, single-headed kinesin moved
microtubules at 0.096 6 0.030 mm/s (mean 6 SD, n 5 86),
whereas wild-type kinesin moved at 0.76 6 0.10 mm/s
(mean 6 SD, n 5 92) (Fig. 6). Similar to two-headed kine-
sin, the gliding speed was independent of motor density
over the ranges measured.
Figure 5. Displacement versus time traces for microtubules mov-
ing over surfaces coated with wild-type kinesin (left panels) and
single-headed kinesin (right panels) at high motor density (280
motors/mm2; top panels) and intermediate motor density (60 mo-
tors/mm2, bottom panels). The tracks of 12 microtubules are
shown. The position of the leading end of each microtubule was
measured every second for wild-type kinesin or every 10 s for sin-
gle-headed kinesin. Note that microtubules often paused (p) or
stalled (s) when moving over surfaces coated with single-headed
kinesin. The short trace in the bottom right panel corresponds to
a microtubule that released from the surface and diffused away
(r). Note that the scale bars correspond to 10 s for wild-type kine-
sin and 100 s for single-headed kinesin, so the similar slopes of
the traces indicates that wild-type kinesin moves about ten times
faster than single-headed kinesin.

Single-headed kinesin, like wild-type kinesin, is a plus
end-directed motor. When gliding assays were performed
with polarity-marked microtubules (Howard and Hyman,
1993), the marked end almost always led: for wild-type ki-
nesin 45 out of 47 microtubules moved with the marked
end leading, and for single-headed kinesin the fraction was
28 out of 30. Because the bright marker is usually located
at the minus end, these results indicate that both motors
move toward the plus end of the microtubule.
The uneven motion shown in Fig. 5, with frequent paus-
ing and stalling, was an inherent property of single-headed
kinesin. It was observed in all four preparations and was
not due to a subpopulation of motors that bound to micro-
tubules but could not move: when such hypothetical âdead
headsâ were removed by incubating the kinesin with mi-
crotubules (0.1 mM tubulin dimer) in the presence of 1
mM ATP and 300 mM KCl followed by an airfuge spin to
remove any irreversibly microtubule-bound motors, the
quality of the movement was unaffected.
Single-headed Motility Is Not Due to
Wild-Type Contamination
It is important to establish that the observed microtubule
movement is generated solely by single-headed kinesin
heterodimer and not by some other kinesin species. Arti-
factual movement could arise from at least three possible
sources: (a) wild-type motors that were not eliminated
during the purification process; (b) wild-type motors formed
by recombination of single-headed heterodimers in solu-
tion; or (c) the formation of two-headed, four-tailed kine-
sin tetramers in solution or on the surface.
The first experiment used to rule out these possibilities
was the physical characterization by sucrose densityâgra-
dient centrifugation (Fig. 4). Simple wild-type contamina-
tion was ruled out because the single-headed kinesin peak
in the sedimentation assay was clearly separated from the
sedimentation rate of two-headed kinesin; had the two-
headed contamination been large enough to obtain the
high landing rates seen in Fig. 7, it would have been de-
tectable in the sedimentation data in Fig. 4. The second
possibility, contamination by recombination, is also not
supported by the sedimentation data: if the zero-, one-, and
two-headed species exist in a dynamic equilibrium through
the 30-h centrifugation, one would expect a broad sedimen-
tation peak encompassing the three predicted sedimenta-
tion values instead of the discrete peaks observed in Fig. 4.
Finally, two-headed, four-tailed tetramers formed from two
single-headed dimers are expected to have a sedimenta-
tion coefficient even larger than the wild-type dimer; hence,
they would have been observable if present and, in any
case, would have been well separated from the heterodimers
in the centrifugation step. The possibility that motility re-
quires the formation of tetramers on the surface is ruled
out because either their formation would be too slow
(Howard et al., 1989) or their density would be very low, in
which case the landing rate and distance curves of Figs. 7
and 8 would have been shifted much farther to the right.
The second experiment used to rule out artifactual mo-
tility relied on our ability to detect small contaminations of
wild-type kinesin in the single-headed fraction. This ability
was demonstrated by adding known amounts of wild-type
motors to the single-headed fraction; in these mixtures (or
in the early stages of the project when separation of single-
and two-headed kinesin was still a problem), high-speed,
single-motor events were observed at low motor density.
Because none of these events were seen in any of the prep-
arations of pure single-headed kinesin, we conclude that
the motility is generated solely by single-headed het-
erodimers and not by wild-type motors present either
from simple contamination or by recombination.
Rates at Which Microtubules Attach to and
Move across Surfaces Coated with Wild-Type and
Single-headed Motors
To determine the minimum number of single-headed mo-

derived from two to six video screens taken from each of one or
two flow cells. Standard error bars were calculated according to
Materials and Methods. The continuous curves are the fits to the
model of Equation 2 with n 5 1 (wild-type) and n 5 5 (single-
headed).

tors required to move a microtubule, the rates at which
microtubules bound to and moved at least 0.3 mm across
surfaces coated with wild-type and single-headed kinesin
were measured over a range of motor densities (Fig. 7).
For surface densities greater than 100 motors/mm2, the
landing rate for both single-headed and wild-type kinesin
was constant at z75 microtubules ? s21 ? mm22. This maxi-
mum rate is presumably limited by the rate at which micro-
tubules diffuse from solution to the motor-coated surface.
As the surface density of wild-type motors was de-
creased, the landing rate also decreased. When the landing
rate was plotted against the density on a logâlog plot (Fig.
7), the slope was approximately equal to one, consistent
with just one wild-type molecule being sufficient for motil-
ity. Below a surface density of 10 motors/mm2, virtually ev-
ery moving microtubule swiveled around a single point on
the surface, moved until its trailing end reached this nodal
point, and then released and diffused back into solution.
This swiveling behavior is also consistent with single-motor
motility. These results are very similar to those obtained
using bovine brain kinesin (Howard et al., 1989), except that
the recombinant Drosophila kinesin used in this study had
a 10-fold higher motor activity, meaning that similar landing
rates were obtained when the recombinant kinesin was at
only one-tenth the surface density of the bovine kinesin.
Presumably a large fraction of bovine brain kinesin is in an
inactive form perhaps due to posttranslational modification.
As the surface density of single-headed kinesin was de-
creased, the landing rate decreased steeply. Below 100
motors/mm2, the slope was approximately equal to three in
the logâlog plot, indicating that more than one single-
headed molecule is required for movement. Below a mo-
tor density of 10 motors/mm2, where individual wild-type
motors were seen moving microtubules, no moving micro-
tubules were detected. To determine the minimum num-
ber of single-headed motors necessary to move a microtu-
bule, the landing rate data were fit to a model in which the
motors are assumed to be bound randomly on the surface
and the microtubules assumed to bind and move only if
they encounter at least n motors (refer to Materials and
Methods). Whereas the wild-type landing rate data were
best fit by the model with n 5 1, the single-headed data
were well fit with n >4. The chi-squared values for n 5 2,
3, 4, 5, and 6 were 28.5, 15.8, 10.7, 8.2, 7.3, respectively, and
the corresponding P values with six degrees of freedom
were ,0.001, 0.015, 0.1, 0.2, and .0.2, respectively. Hence,
the shape of the landing rate curve indicates that the mini-
mum number of single-headed motor molecules required
for motility is at least four. This conclusion remains valid
even if the detailed mechanism describing the landing and
movement is more complex than assumed in the model.
For example, the association of microtubules with surfaces
sparsely coated with single-headed kinesin might be coop-
erative: the microtubule might first bind to one motor,
then it might swivel around until a second motor is en-
gaged. However, such cooperativity leads to shallower
curves and an underestimation of the minimum number of
molecules required (refer to Materials and Methods).
Thus, the lower bound is not affected.
The slope of the landing rate curve does not provide a
reliable upper bound because several experimental fac-
tors, such as the dispersion of microtubule length, might
make the curve shallower. However, an upper bound on
the minimum number of single-headed motors required
for motility can be obtained from the relative positions of
the two landing rate curves along the density axis. If a
large number of single-headed motors were required for
motility, then the single-headed landing rate curve would
be notably rightward shifted with respect to the two-
headed curve. However, the data show very little shift, in-
dicating that the minimum number is modest. To calculate
an upper bound, we estimated the largest possible shift be-
tween the curves that is consistent with the errors associ-
ated with measuring the densities of the single-headed and
wild-type molecules. These errors, expressed as relative
SEMs, include uncertainties in measuring the protein con-
centration (30% for single-headed and 25% for wild-type
kinesin), and uncertainties in measuring the positions of
the curves (6% for the single-headed and 18% for the
wild-type curve). Furthermore, the fraction of active wild-
type kinesin on the glass surfaces was estimated to be
z50% (refer to Materials and Methods), leading to an
additional potential rightward shift of the single-headed
curve by a factor of two. Combining these uncertainties,
values for an upper limit, with their corresponding P val-
ues, are n < 4 (P . 0.05), n < 5 (P . 0.01), or n < 6 (P .
0.005). However, the estimate of the upper bound, unlike
the estimate of the lower bound, does depend on the de-
tailed mechanism of the landing process, so these numbers
might need to be increased slightly. For example, if the
swiveling of a microtubule on one single-headed molecule
increases the possibility of finding a second molecule, this
would increase the upper bound by one.
Combining our upper and lower limits, we deduce that
four to six single-headed motors are necessary and suffi-
cient for continuous motility.
Distances Moved by Wild-Type and
Single-headed Motors
A second, independent estimate of the number of single-
headed kinesin motor molecules required to move a mi-
crotubule was obtained from measurements of the dis-
tances moved by microtubules over surfaces coated with
single-headed or wild-type kinesin at various densities. Mi-
crotubules two to three micrometers in length were fol-
lowed for 30 s over wild-type kinesin or for 300 s over sin-
gle-headed kinesin, and then the proportion of microtubules
that moved a distance greater than their length was plot-
ted as a function of motor density (Fig. 8).
For wild-type kinesin, every microtubule moved a dis-
tance greater than its length when the motor density was
high. The fraction of microtubules that moved more than
their own length gradually decreased as the motor density
decreased, until at the lowest densities (, 10 motors/mm2),
no microtubules moved more than their length (Fig. 8,
open squares). At these low densities microtubules land on
single motors, move until the motor reaches the end of the
microtubule, and then diffuse away.
For single-headed kinesin, the curve was both steeper
and shifted to the right of the wild-type curve (Fig. 8,
closed circles). At high densities, almost all the microtu-
bules moved greater than their own length but as the den-
sity decreased, the fraction that moved more than their
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 140, 1998
1402
own length fell abruptly. The abrupt drop implies that
multiple single-headed motor molecules are required to
move a microtubule. Microtubule movement at lower den-
sities of single-headed motors failed both because the
microtubules stopped moving (stalled) and because they
released from the surface and diffused away as in the wild-
type assay. To estimate the minimum number of single-
headed motors required for motility, the data were fit to a
model in which the motors are assumed to be randomly lo-
cated on the surface but the microtubule can only move if
more than a minimum number, n, of motors can interact
with the microtubule (refer to Materials and Methods).
The best fit to the wild-type data was with n 5 1, consis-
tent with wild-type kinesin being processive. In contrast,
the best fit for the single-headed data was with n 5 4. The
chi-squared values for n 5 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 48.6, 26.0,
19.6, and 17.9, respectively, and the corresponding P val-
ues with seven degrees of freedom were ,0.001, ,0.001,
0.007, and 0.012, respectively. These P values are small for
all values of n, possibly indicating that the uncertainties
were underestimated. However, it is clear that the fit for
n 5 2 is significantly worse than the fits for n > 3, and so
we conclude that at least three single-headed molecules
are required for continuous motility.
As in the case of the landing rate curves, an upper
bound on the minimum number of single-headed motors
was estimated from the relative positions of wild-type and
single-headed curves along the log (density) axis. We cal-
culate that n < 10 with 95% confidence.
Individual Single-headed Motors Bind to but Do Not 
Move Microtubules
The abrupt decrease in the motor activity of single-headed
kinesin is not due to its failure to bind to microtubules at
low densities. On the contrary, even at 1 mM ATP concen-
tration, microtubules did bind to surfaces sparsely coated
with single-headed kinesin (though they failed to move).
The fraction of microtubules that moved more than 0.3
mm decreased from nearly one at high motor density, to
zero as the surface density of motors was decreased (Fig. 9
A). At the lowest motor densities where no movement was
detected, microtubules swiveled around single points indi-
cating that individual single-headed kinesin can bind mi-
crotubules but not move them. At higher densities, mov-
ing microtubules never swiveled, although sometimes they
paused, transiently released from the surface, and then
continued in a different direction. A histogram of bound
times for microtubules bound to individual single-headed
motors was fit by a single exponential with a time constant
of 3.1 s (Fig. 9 B). Hence, individual single-headed motors
can bind to microtubules for many seconds, but multiple
single-headed motors are required to move a microtubule.
Discussion
By analyzing the movement of microtubules over surfaces
coated with single-headed kinesin at various densities, we
conclude that single-headed kinesin is not a processive

bules of length between two and three micrometers were ob-
served for 30 s for wild-type kinesin (open squares) or for 300 s
for single-headed kinesin (closed symbols). Standard error bars
were calculated according to Materials and Methods. The contin-
uous curves are the fits to the model of Eq. 3 with n 5 1 (wild-
type) and n 5 4 (single-headed).

underestimate due to missed events. A fit of the data to a single
exponential curve with a time constant of 3.1 s is shown. The
ATP concentration was 1 mM.

motor. Instead, some four to six single-headed molecules
are necessary and sufficient for continuous motility, and
when an insufficient number of motors are present, single-
headed kinesin binds to microtubules and releases only
very slowly.
The motility of single-headed kinesin molecules implies
that there is a directed conformational change induced by
ATP hydrolysis within the head domain itself, and that di-
rected movement does not require a two-headed structure.
This result confirms previous experiments using one-headed,
tailless kinesin fragments (Stewart et al., 1993; Berliner et
al., 1995; Vale et al., 1996), although, as mentioned in the
Introduction there was the possibility that these other sin-
gle-headed proteins could have oligomerized in solution
or on the surface.
Single-headed Kinesin Is Not Processive
Several lines of evidence show that single-headed kinesin
is not processive: (a) There is no movement at low density;
(b) When movement does occur at intermediate densities,
the microtubules do not swivel: since kinesin molecules
have high torsional flexibility (Hunt and Howard, 1993),
the failure to swivel indicates that the moving microtu-
bules must be attached to motors located at two or more
points on the surface; (c) The landing rate falls abruptly as
the density is decreased; and (d) The probability of a mi-
crotubule moving more than its length also decreases
abruptly as the density is decreased. The last two argu-
ments are especially strong because they do not rely on
knowledge of the absolute concentration of active protein,
since the presence of inactive protein does not change the
slope of the dilution curves when they are plotted against
the logarithm of density. This was a major rationale for our
approach.
Taken together, the landing rate and distance data indi-
cate that a minimum of four to six single-headed motors
are necessary for motility. Importantly, these data clearly
rule out the possibility that two single-headed heterodimers
suffice for motility. Therefore, uncoupling the two heads
of kinesin, which are normally tightly associated through
the coiled-coil dimerization domain, destroys the coordi-
nation necessary for processive motility.
Evidence for Mechanical Communication between 
Individual Single-headed Kinesin Motors
The finding that individual single-headed kinesin mole-
cules remain bound to microtubules for several seconds
accords with a key prediction of the hand-over-hand model,
namely that the binding of the second head accelerates the
detachment of the bound head. A wild-type motor moving
at 800 nm/s takes 100 steps/s, and each head must detach
50 times/s on average. Given that the mean bound time of
single-headed kinesin is 3 s, corresponding to a detach-
ment rate of 0.3/s, the second head in the wild-type dimer
must accelerate the unbinding of the first head by at least
100-fold. We do not believe that this acceleration is simply
due to direct head-to-head contacts within the dimer, since
comparable acceleration occurs in the case of single-
headed molecules where there is no possibility of direct
contact between heads (see below). Instead, we believe
that the acceleration is due to strain arising from the bind-
ing of the second head or from a subsequent conforma-
tional change in the second head after it binds (refer to
Fig. 1, iii). Therefore, the finding that simultaneous bind-
ing of the two heads to the polar microtubule may require
considerable strain (Kozielski et al., 1997) is not inconsis-
tent with the hand-over-hand model. Indeed, the approxi-
mate twofold symmetry of the dimer may be the structural
basis for the mechanical communication between kinesinâs
two heads (Howard, 1996).
The notion of mechanical strain provides a simple in-
sight into the directionality and load dependence of the
motor. If the nucelotide-free head (the second) has a
longer attached time than the ATP head (the first), then
the first head will usually release before the second (refer
to Fig. 1 [iii]), thereby imparting directionality to the pro-
cess. If the motor is placed under a load that opposes the
movement toward the plus end of the microtubule, then
this load is expected to partially relieve the strain and
therefore decelerate the release of the first head, account-
ing for the decrease in speed (Svoboda and Block, 1994;
MeyhÃ¶fer and Howard, 1995). Thus, the notion of strain
leads to a specific prediction as to which structural step is
slowed by load. Conversely, a negative load is expected to
accelerate release and lead to an increase in speed, as ob-
served (Coppin et al., 1997).
Interestingly, some sort of mechanical communication
must also take place between single-headed molecules
that are moving microtubules at intermediate and high
densities (Fig. 10 A). This is because the single-headed
speed of 100 nm/s still requires a release rate of 12 s21, or
even higher if the single-headed steps are smaller than 8
nm, as is likely (see below). Thus, the release rate must
also be accelerated during motility by single-headed mo-
tors, implying that they are also coordinated according
to the hand-over-hand mechanism. Such coordination be-
tween single-headed molecules is possible because they
are mechanically coupled via their tails through the glass
substrate and via their heads through the microtubule; in
this way strain developed in one head after it binds to the
microtubule can be felt by the other attached heads. Be-
cause the moving microtubules are several microns in
length, allostery must be occurring over distances of one
micron! Is a microtubule rigid enough to mediate such me-
chanical coupling? The maximum work generated by a
single kinesin molecule is z40 pN?nm (Svoboda and
Block, 1994; MeyhÃ¶fer and Howard, 1995), so the maxi-
mum distortion of a 1-mm-long microtubule, whose stiff-
ness is z400 pN/nm (Gittes et al., 1993), is only z0.45 nm
(5[2 3 40/400]1/2). Because this distance is smaller than
the 8-nm step size (or even the z1-nm step of the single-
headed motor, see below) this argument shows that the
microtubule is rigid enough to transmit such mechanical
signals without significant loss.
Mechanical coordination between single-headed kine-
sins might explain how the monomeric kinesin-related
proteins KIF1A and KIF1B mentioned in the Introduction
function as organelle transporters. If they have similar
mechanical properties to single-headed kinesin, then only
four to six such motors on the surface of an organelle
would suffice for motility, since the mechanical coordina-
tion would ensure that the organelle remain associated
with the microtubule (Fig. 10 B). Thus, a dimeric structure
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 140, 1998
1404
might not be essential for organelle transport; instead, our
results suggest that it is mechanical communication be-
tween motor domains in a macromolecular assembly that
is the essential requirement for continuous motility. Such
mechanical coordination might occur in smooth muscle
myosin or may contribute to the ability of unconventional
myosins to mediate organelle transport along actin fila-
ments (Howard, 1997).
The Working Stroke and the Duty Ratio
A simple interpretation of the low speed of single-headed
kinesin is that removal of the second head reduces the me-
chanical amplification of a small conformational change
that occurs in the remaining head. This is analogous to the
reduction in speed of myosin when its âlever armâ is trun-
cated (refer to Introduction). The speed of a motor is the
working distance (the distance moved during the part of
the ATP hydrolysis cycle that the head is attached), di-
vided by the attached time (Howard, 1997). If the attached
times of single- and two-headed kinesin are the same, then
the lower speed suggests that single-headed kinesin has a
smaller working distance of only z1 nm (5 8 nm 3 0.096
nm/s 4 0.76 nm/s). Although this conclusion is tentative in
the absence of a direct measurement of the working dis-
tance or the attached time, it does offer a simple reason
why several single-headed kinesin molecules are required
for continuous motility: a 1-nm working distance is not
large enough to bring the head to its next binding site
on the microtubule. If each head were to track a single
protofilament, then the next site would be 8 nm away, the
length of the tubulin dimer (Ray et al., 1993). However, if
the heads are able to interact with several different
protofilaments, as appears to be the case when dimeriza-
tion is disrupted (Berliner et al., 1995), then the next bind-
ing site is only z6 nm away, since adjacent subunits in the
B lattice are offset by z1 nm (Song and Mandelkow,
1993). Hence, this structural argument predicts a mini-
mum number of single-headed motors required for motil-
ity of approximately six, in agreement with the measure-
ments presented in this paper. Thus, we believe that
single-headed kinesin is not processive because its work-
ing distance is too small to reach the next tubulin dimer.

Survival analysis of 5595 head and neck cancers-
results of conventional treatment in a high-risk
population

Summary This is a study of 5595 head and neck cancer patients treated during 1987-89 at TMH, Mumbai. The study included 1970 oral
cancers (ICD 140-145), 1495 oropharyngeal cancers (ICD 1410, 1453, 146), 1255 hypopharyngeal cancers (ICD 148), 125 nasopharyngeal
cancers (ICD 147) and 750 laryngeal cancers (ICD 161). The clinical extent of disease at presentation was based on TNM group staging
(UICC 1978). For the majority of sites, patients attended the hospital during stage IlIl and stage IV of the disease; the only exception was for
cancers of the lower lip, anterior tongue and vocal cord when between 46.2% and 56.5% of patients with localized cancer (stage and 11) were
seen. Generally, surgery either alone or with radiation has been administered for oral cancer patients whereas radiation either alone or in
combination with chemotherapy was administered for other head and neck sites. The overall 5-year survival rate was in the range of 20-43%
for oral cancer, 8-25% for pharyngeal cancers and 25-62% for laryngeal cancer. The 5-year relative survival rates were more or less in
agreement with the results published by the Eurocare study for head and neck cancers. The importance of primary prevention in head and
neck cancer is stressed.
Keywords: head and neck cancer; survival; TNM; stage; treatment
Incidence data that are available from six metropolitan cities and
one rural registry in India indicate that head and neck cancer is a
common problem there (IARC,
1992). Many epidemiological
studies carried out in the sub-continent have shown the association
of tobacco, alcohol and some dietary items with head and neck
cancer. Although primary prevention may be the ideal choice for
the control of head and neck cancer, secondary prevention through
therapeutic intervention has an equal and important role to play.
Management of head and neck cancer in a high-risk population
and its response to conventional treatment and survival have not
been reported in detail. The aim is to analyse individual sites of
head and neck cancer according to stage of the disease, primary
treatment
and
other prognostic
factors
for 5-year
survival.
Comparison is also made with survival in European countries.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
This is a retrospective analysis of 5595 eligible head and neck cancer
patients who were diagnosed and treated at Tata Memorial Hospital,
Mumbai, during the period 1987-89. The eligibility criteria for
inclusion of patients in the study were: (1) no prior cancer-directed
treatment at the time of registration; (2) histologically confirmed
epithelial cancer; (3) treatment with chemotherapy together with
surgery or radiation but not as the only treatment; and (4) at least 50
cases in each subsite of head and neck cancer. The excluded subsites

were upper lip (five cases), commissure of lip (six cases), tongue
NOS (not otherwise specified) (one case), salivary gland (39 cases),
palate NOS
(two cases) and
subglottic larynx (seven
cases).
Information on age, sex, date of diagnosis, method of diagnosis,
primary site (ICD 1978), secondary site, if available, histology of
primary and/or secondary tumour, TNM staging (UICC, 1978) and
primary treatment given within 6 months of diagnosis were obtained
from the database maintained by the hospital cancer registry. The
clinical extent of the disease for head and neck cancer cases was clas-
sified into four stages, viz. stage I comprising TINO MO status, stage II
comprising T2 No MO, stage III comprising T3 No MO, T3 N, MO,T, N
MO and T2 N MO and stage IV comprising T4No MO, T4 N MO, and
any T, N2 or N3 MO and any T any N M,. Periodic updating of follow-
up information was carried out either by scrutiny of medical records
of attending patients or by postal enquiry responses. In some cases,
follow-up information was also obtained by scrutiny of death records
maintained by the Municipal Corporation of the City, of life insur-
ance claims and of records from terminal care centres/pain clinic in
the city. The study was closed on 31 March 1996, and data available
up to that time were used for the survival analyses. In this study of
5595 patients, 2435 patients (43%) were known to have died and
1128 patients (20%) were known to be alive at the end of 5 years
from their date of diagnosis. For the remaining 2032 patients, 267
patients (4.7%) had follow-up information for between 3 and 5 years,
1384 patients (24.7%), categorized as non-responders, had less than
3 years of follow-up information and 381 patients (6.8%) had incom-
plete addresses (untraced cases). Complete follow-up information
was 68% for the laryngeal group, 65% for oral cancer, 64% for the
oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal group and 60% for the hypo-
pharyngeal group. At the end of 1 year, the equivalent figures were
about 84% for laryngeal cancer and 70-80% for the other groups.

The number of untraced cases was around 7% for all sites, except
laryngeal cancer for which the figure was 3.7%; similarly, the propor-
tion of non-responders was around 25% for all sites except for laryn-
geal
cancer
(21.6%).
The
proportion
of
both
untraced
and
non-responding patients who had stage HII and stage IV cancers at
their first visit to hospital was between 70% and 92% in the different
site groups, and these patients were considered unsuitable for further
treatment, except for pain relief or symptomatic treatment. Patients
with less than 3 years of follow-up were considered as being
deceased, and survival information available up to that time was used
for analysis purposes. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to esti-
mate survival rates for 1,3 and 5 years and also to assess certain prog-
nostic factors considered in the study. As 70% of the patients attended
hospital from Maharashtra state, the life table for Maharashtra State,
published by the Government of India for the period 1986-90 (RGI,
1994), was used to estimate the relative survival rates.

cancer (46.2%), for most of the sites, patients with stage I and
stage II disease together accounted for between 7.9%, for lower
alveolus cancers, and 27.7%, for hard palate cancers.
Management of oral cancer depends largely on the stage of the
disease. In our series, surgery alone or radiotherapy alone or their
combination remained as the primary treatment. The 'other' treat-
ment category mostly included the combination of chemotherapy
with either surgery or radiation or both in the management of oral
cancer. The 5-year observed survival rate varied between 20% for
the upper alveolus and 43% for lower lip cancers.
The comparable data for pharyngeal and laryngeal cancers are
presented in Table 2. In contrast to most of the cancers, a marked
predominance of men was seen for all the sites except for post-
cricoid cancers, for which a female excess was observed. The
average age of the patients varied between 38.2 years for cancer of
the nasopharynx and 56.6 years for oropharyngeal cancer. The base
of the tongue (818 cases) and pyriform fossa (1000 cases) were the
two predominant sites observed in this group. The TNM stage distri-
bution of individual sites indicated that 80-90% of cases presented
with stage III or IV malignancies, the only exception being for vocal
cord cancers for which the percentage was much lower (30%). In
view of this, for most of the patients, radiotherapy was administered
as the only treatment. In the case of nasopharyngeal cancer, radiation
along with chemotherapy was administered for about 44.8% of the
patients and the 5-year observed survival rate for vocal cord cancer
was about 62%. For all other sites, the 5-year survival rate ranged
between 8%, for hypopharyngeal cancers, and 25%, for both soft
palate and supra glottic cancers.
The 5-year observed survival rates according to primary treat-
ment for the eighteen sites of head and neck cancer considered are
presented in Table 3. Surgery, when used alone for the treatment of
oral cancer, was followed by a 30-58% 5-year survival of patients.
The 5-year survival for radiotherapy alone in oral and pharyngeal
cancers in our study was in the range of 3-24%. Vocal cord cancer,
when treated by radiotherapy alone, showed a 62% 5-year survival
rate.

rates for particular

The 5-year relative survival rates by sex and TNM stage for all
the 18 sites of head and neck cancer are presented in Table 4.
Women showed better 5-year survival rates for cancers of the floor

hypopharynx (M, 8.6%; F, 11.3%) than men. The stage of the
disease is known to be an important prognostic factor. With the
increase in the stage of disease, there has been a corresponding
decrease in survival. Although few patients were observed with

stage I cancer, the 5-year relative survival rates were in the range
56-100% for oral cancers (except for the upper alveolus), 50-90%
for oropharyngeal cancer, 100% for nasopharyngeal cancer and
74-79% for laryngeal cancer. This indicates the effectiveness of
conventional treatment in the early stage of the disease.
DISCUSSION
This is a retrospective analysis of 5595 head and neck cancer
patients treated during the period 1987-89. Some other sites,
namely upper lip, nasal sinus, max antrum and salivary glands,
were not included mainly because of the small number of cases
and/or because non-epithelial cancers were prevalent among these
sites. Management of head and neck cancer depends largely on the
size of the tumour, nodal status and histological variety. For oral
cancer, surgery either alone or in combination with radiation had
been the modality of treatment. For oropharyngeal and hypo-
pharyngeal cancers, radiation therapy had been administered,
largely because of the advanced stage of the disease at presenta-
tion. In the case of nasopharyngeal cancer, chemotherapy had been
administered along with radiation therapy in a large percentage of
cases. Laser surgery had been performed for a few selected sites of
head and neck cancer but was not identified separately in our
analyses. The sequence of treatments, when more than one was
administered, has not been considered. In addition, no attempt has
been made to identify the nature of surgery or level of radiation
dose or chemotherapy schedule in evaluating the efficacy of the
treatment. Furthermore, statistical comparison has not been made
of the efficacy of different treatments from the data presented in
Table 3, mainly because of the likehood of selection bias and of
patients' reluctance to undergo surgery, which often would have
involved reconstruction and a long stay in hospital. In this study,
we have not looked at disease-free survival to indicate the efficacy
of primary treatment for head and neck cancer, and many of the
patients during the course of follow-up may have received treat-
ment for recurrences or for metastatic disease that subsequently
prolonged their survival; in which case, primary treatment alone
cannot be considered to have cured the disease.
In general, among the patients considered for the study, 25%
came from the city of Mumbai, about 45% from the State of
Maharashtra and the rest from various states in India. Cancer is not
a notifiable disease and vital statistics records for various states in
India do not provide the cause of death. Patients' follow-up status
was ascertained mainly through postal inquiry. Non-availability of
complete addresses for the patients and failure to respond to our
postal
inquiry
are
the
factors
responsible
for a
significant
percentage of loss during the first year of follow-up in our study.
However, the assumption that patients lost to follow-up by the end
of 3 years were dead is probably reasonable given that the majority
had stage III or IV cancers the last time that they were seen.
The results of the present study are compared in Table 5 with
those from the Eurocare study (IARC, 1995). In our study, the
results are available for subsites of all head and neck cancers
(fourth digit ICD), whereas in the Eurocare study some sites are
only available by three-digit site (e.g. 141 - tongue) or by combi-
nations of three-digit codes, as in the case of oral cavity (ICD
143-145). To facilitate comparisons, grouped results are also
given for the Indian data in Table 5, including here the small
number of subsites that were excluded from the main body of the
study. Although the 5-year survival rates show distinct variation
between the sites and subsites, the results obtained in our study are
reasonably similar to those observed in the Eurocare study. The
importance of reporting survival by subsites is clearly brought out
in the case of tongue, oral cavity and pharynx.
Other studies have been reported in the literature either for all
sites of head and neck cancer individually or by groups (Flores et
al, 1986; Rice and Spiro, 1989; Steinhart and Leinsassaer, 1992;
Cole et al, 1994; Sagar et al, 1994; Mishra et al, 1996; Mohanti et
al, 1996; Grau et al, 1997). The direct comparison of our study
results with those reported in the literature has to be done with
caution, however, especially as the majority of studies report
observed rather than relative survival rates.
Head and neck cancer constitute about one-third of all cancer seen
at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. The TNM staging distribution of
head and neck cancer in the hospital over the years indicates that a
high percentage of cases were seen at an advanced stage of the disease
(HCR, 1996). The present study also showed a large percentage of
patients with advanced disease at presentation. This, in turn, is
reflected in the low survival rates observed for some sites of head and
neck cancer in comparison with those seen in European countries.
Many epidemiological studies carried out from high-risk and
low-risk populations have indicated the association of tobacco,
alcohol, the chewing of betel quid and some dietary items with
head and neck cancer. Eventually, head and neck cancer control
will best be achieved through primary prevention, although earlier
diagnosis should also be an aim.

Summary The frequency and severity of fatty infiltration of the liver in patients receiving 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid has not been
documented systematically.
Its development can
result
in difficulty assessing disease progression, and treatment may be altered
inappropriately. Twenty-seven patients with colon cancer and liver metastases receiving 5-FU and folinic acid were studied with computerized
tomography (CT) before treatment and after six or 12 cycles of chemotherapy. Forty-seven per cent of patients developed hepatic steatosis
during treatment. There was no correlation between development of hepatic steatosis and the dose of chemotherapy or the liver function
tests. Hepatic steatosis occurs commonly in patients receiving 5-FU and folinic acid and can be severe. Its development can make hepatic
metastases difficult to assess and if its benign nature is not appreciated treatment may be inappropriately altered.
Keywords: colon cancer; liver steatosis; computerized tomography; chemotherapy; 5-fluorouracil
In the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer,
abdominal computerized tomography (CT) is the most widely
used technique to determine stage and to monitor the response of
liver metastases and other sites of disease to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-
based chemotherapy. The diagnosis of metastatic disease is either
made during laparotomy or by CT- or ultrasound-guided liver
biopsy.
It has been observed, while scanning such patients, that they
may develop
a decrease
in
liver attenuation
consistent with
steatosis during treatment with 5-FU, which is used extensively
alone or in combination with other drugs for adenocarcinoma of
the large bowel. Although fatty change of the liver is well recog-
nized
after administration of various chemotherapy regimens
(Leevy and Tygstrup, 1976), its frequency and severity has not
been documented. Also its occurrence after 5-FU alone or with
folinic acid has been noted incidentally in one study and found
only
to occur when administered with
interferon
in another
(Moertel et al, 1993; Sorensen et al, 1995). The accuracy of CT in
establishing the presence of fatty change of the liver is well estab-
lished (Bydder et al, 1980).
The decrease in liver attenuation is important because metas-
tases demonstrated on CT are usually of lower attenuation than
normal liver parenchyma and as the liver becomes more fatty, and
therefore less dense, the metastases can become increasingly diffi-
cult to delineate. This may result in the false impression of a ther-
apeutic response. The confusion can be exacerbated particularly in
the presence of focal sparring within fatty change that can mimic
metastases (Yates and Streight, 1986). Treatment may be stopped
if this benign cause for the liver appearances is misinterpreted as
progressive disease.

The aim of this study is to examine the frequency and severity
of fatty change of the liver as seen on CT in patients receiving 5-
FU and folinic acid, and to document its relationship to the quan-
tity of chemotherapy and correlate this with biochemical liver
function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Twenty-seven patients treated in the period between May 1991
and June 1994 were studied. Thirteen of these were reviewed
retrospectively and 14 patients studied prospectively. One patient
had previously received 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. All
patients had known liver metastases and suitable pre- and post-
contrast CT examinations available for study, before starting
chemotherapy. Each cycle of chemotherapy consisted of folinic
acid (200 mg m-2, maximum total dose of 350 mg) infusion over
2 h, followed by 5-FU intravenously (800 mg m-2) over 22 h and
then repeated the following day (De Gramont regimen).
Patients with a known cause for fatty liver, such as diabetes
mellitus,
malabsorption
and
pancreatitis
were
excluded.
Documentation of alcohol history was poor but if the baseline CT
examination did not show fatty infiltration it was assumed that
drinking habits had not changed, or had decreased during treat-
ment, and these patients were included. Patients who had progres-
sive disease defined by increasing size of metastases or rising
tumour markers were also excluded to ensure that the decrease in
liver attenuation was due to
infiltration with fat rather than
progressing liver metastases.
All patients had a baseline CT examination of the abdomen with
and without intravenous contrast medium and were re-examined
after six or 12 cycles of chemotherapy using the same scanning
protocol. The scans were performed on a GE Hi- speed advantage
machine. Contiguous 10-mm slices were performed before and
during intravenous administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 300
either by hand injection or by using a pump with a flow rate of
3 ml s-'. This provided eight to ten anatomical sections through the

liver, both before and after intravenous contrast medium, for each
examination. Liver attenuation was measured on the uncontrasted
images using a 100 mm3 ROI cursor. Three measurements were
made randomly on each image with reference to the contrast
enhanced images
to avoid
the
liver metastases and
vessels.
Observations were made by two radiologists independently (DP
and RHR). The median liver attenuation for each image was calcu-
lated and the median of all the images was taken to give the overall
liver attenuation for each CT examination. If the patient was
scanned several times during treatment the maximum change in
liver attenuation was taken irrespective of when this occurred. A
small number of patients were referred for further CT examina-
tions after completion of chemotherapy, and in these patients liver
attenuation was calculated using the same method. Liver function
tests (AST, alkaline phosphatase and LDH), tumour markers (CEA
and CA 19/9) and clinical response were all documented at the time
of each CT examination. Based on the null hypothesis that there
would be no change in liver attenuation after treatment, statistical
analysis was performed using Student's t-test.
RESULTS
From the initial 27 patients, six were excluded. Two patients had a
liver attenuation of 34.8 Hounsfield units (HU) and 38 HU before
treatment, although the cause of their fatty infiltration was not
apparent. Four patients had progressive disease after six cycles of
chemotherapy, as determined by a rising CEA and increasing size
of the liver metastases. The remaining 21 patients (11 male, ten
female, age 37-74 years) were included in the analysis, all of
whom had clinically either a partial response or stable disease at
the time of restaging.
All patients had a liver attenuation of >43 HU before treatment
(mean
53.5 HU,
range
43.1-62.4)
and
after
completion
of
chemotherapy, the mean liver attenuation was 40.3 HU, with a
range between -3.9 and 63.1 HU. The mean fall in liver attenua-
tion was 13.2 HU (Figure 1).
Eleven patients had a change in liver attenuation of less than
10 HU. Five of these had an actual increase in liver attenuation.
The remaining ten patients demonstrated a decrease of greater than
10 HU (range 11.9-53.7 HU), of which four patients had a fall of
20-30 HU and two a fall of >50 HU. Overall, there was a signifi-
cant difference in liver attenuation of all 21 patients before and
after treatment (P = 0.0019). There was no statistical difference
between male and female (P = 0.685). Four patients continued to
have CT examinations after completion of chemotherapy, and in
each case there was an increase in liver attenuation (after the initial
decrease) with a mean of 17 HU (range 7-21 HU). These CT
examinations were performed between 3 and 6 months after
finishing treatment.
In all patients the decrease in liver attenuation was diffuse rather
than focal. Although the results of liver function tests (AST and
alkaline phosphatase) fluctuated, the majority of patients (n = 18)
had levels that remained within the normal range throughout treat-
ment. Three patients had AlkP levels above the normal range
during treatment but these returned to normal during treatment,
except in one case when the alkaline phosphatase fell from four
times normal to two times normal; all these patients had a change
in liver attenuation of less than 10 HU.
The AST was elevated before treatment in three patients but in
all cases returned to normal during treatment; this was seen in two
of these patients who had a change in liver attenuation of less than
10 HU and in one patient who had a decrease of 29 HU. Abnormal
liver function tests were not seen in the patients who developed the
greatest decrease in liver attenuation. There was no correlation
between the liver function tests and the degree of fatty infiltration.
In
14 patients the maximum decrease
in
liver attenuation
occurred after the first six cycles of chemotherapy and in six
patients after 12 cycles. One patient had only four cycles of
chemotherapy. The average total dose of 5-FU was 19 984 mg and
the median time to develop decrease in liver attenuation was 126
days (range 75-287 days).
DISCUSSION
In this study, 16 out of 21 (76%) patients receiving 5-FU and folinic
acid developed a decrease in liver attenuation during treatment and
in 10 out of 21 (48%) this was sufficient to cause steatosis. The
accuracy of unenhanced CT in the diagnosis of fatty infiltration of
the liver is well established (Bydder et al, 1980, 1981; Allaway
et al, 1988). There is a good inverse relationship between the CT
number in Hounsfield units and the triglyceride content of the liver
(Allaway et al, 1988; Bydder et al, 1980). Severe fatty infiltration
when the portal veins become more dense than the surrounding
hepatic parenchyma may be easy to recognize (Scatarige et al,
1984), but less marked changes may be difficult to appreciate and
previous studies have shown that a fall ofjust 10 HU corresponded
to a grade 1 steatosis at biopsy (Sorensen et al, 1995).
In view of the previously established inverse relationship
between fatty change and attenuation value on CT,
it was not
considered ethical to biopsy patients for histological confirmation
as this would not have altered management; however the exclusion
of patients who had evidence of progressive disease either on CT,
clinical or biochemical grounds, or elevation of tumour markers
ensured that the decrease in liver attenuation was not due to diffuse
metastatic infiltration. The increase in liver attenuation seen in
those patients scanned after chemotherapy further supports this.
Fatty infiltration can be diffuse (Stephens and Sheedy, 1983), and
both
types
have
been
documented
in
patients
receiving
chemotherapy (Gimondo
et
al,
1995; Sorensen
et
al,
1995).
Recognition of diffuse
fatty
infiltration
in
patients receiving
chemotherapy for a known malignancy is important; initially the
liver is of higher attenuation than the hepatic metastases, but as the
liver becomes less dense the metastatic deposits appear isodense
and thus difficult to delineate, making assessment of size and
hence response to treatment difficult.
Secondly, if the benign cause of the liver appearances are not
appreciated, treatment may be inappropriately stopped or altered.
Focal fatty infiltration can produce further confusion (Yates and
Streight, 1986; Gimondo et al, 1995). Commonly focal fatty infil-
tration produces wedge-shaped areas of low attenuation, extending
to the periphery of the liver without mass effect (Halvorsen et al,
1976). This is usually easy to diagnose on ultrasound or CT;
however,
in
the context of patients receiving chemotherapy,
assessment of the presence and size of metastases is more difficult.
Multiple rounded well-defined areas of fatty infiltration simulating
metastases have also been described in patients not known to have
malignant disease who were being investigated for abdominal pain
(Yates and Streight, 1986). In both these situations, if the diagnosis
is considered, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more
helpful (Schertz et al, 1989) and may obviate the need for biopsy.
The mechanism of fatty infiltration of the liver is unknown.
Hepatotoxicity has rarely been reported when 5-FU has been

administered alone. A recent study demonstrated fatty infiltration
in patients receiving 5-FU combined with IFN but not in those
receiving
5-FU
alone
or
in
combination
with
folinic
acid
(Sorensen et al, 1995). A previous study primarily examining
hepatotoxicity of 5-FU and folinic acid included 376 patients of
whom 43 had CT scans of the abdomen, in only 3 of the 43
patients was fatty infiltration of the liver documented. Whether
this was present before treatment was not known (Moertel et al,
1993). The lower incidence reported in this study may be because
fatty infiltration was noted incidentally in the small number of
patients who had CT scans but was not routinely documented.
The findings in this study demonstrate that fatty infiltration of
the liver is more common than previously documented and occurs
in patients given 5-FU not just in combination with IFN (Sorensen
et al, 1995) but also with folinic acid. It can be severe and cause
difficulty in assessing response to treatment. If its benign and
reversible nature is not recognized, there may be unnecessary

Ingestion of arsenic-contaminated drinking water is associated with an increased risk of several
cancers, including skin and bladder malignancies; but it is not yet clear whether such adverse
effects are present at levels to which the U.S. population is exposed. In New Hampshire,
detectable levels of arsenic have been reported in drinking water supplies throughout the state.
Therefore, we have begun a population-based epidemiologic case-control study in which
residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with primary squamous cell (n=900) and basal cell
(n= 1200) skin cancers are being selected from a special statewide skin cancer incidence survey;
patients diagnosed with primary bladder cancers (n=450) are being identified through the New
Hampshire State Cancer Registry. Exposure histories of these patients will be compared to a
control group of individuals randomly selected from population lists (n= 1200). Along with a
detailed personal interview, arsenic and other trace elements are being measured in toenail
clipping samples using instrumental neutron activation analysis. Household water samples are
being tested on selected participants using a hydride generation technique with high-resolution
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In the first 793 households tested, arsenic
concentrations ranged from undetectable (0.01 pg/l) to 180 pg/I. Over 10% of the private wells
contained levels above 10 pg/i and 2.5% were above 50 pg/i. Based on our projected sample size,
we expect at least 80% power to detect a 2-fold risk of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or
bladder cancer among individuals with the highest 5% toenail concentrations of arsenic.

preservatives, feed additives, and semicon-
ductor applications (e.g., gallium arsenide).
Patients were treated with arsenic-contain-
ing drugs such as potassium arsenite (e.g.,
Fowler solution) for benign skin conditions
in the 19th and early 20th century, but
arsenic is now rarely used medicinally (1).
In high concentrations (e.g., > 2000
pg/kg/day), arsenic is toxic to humans, and
among the reported long-term health effects
associated with nonfatal doses are vascular
diseases, diabetes, and cancers-specifically
cancers of the skin (basal cell and squamous
cell), lung, bladder, kidney, and liver. These
observations have been made among indi-
viduals exposed to arsenic occupationally or
through drinking water contamination or
pharmacologic uses (2). In humans, organic
arsenic compounds (e.g., arsenobetaine,
found in seafood) are not as toxic as inor-
ganic arsenic. The carcinogenic effects of
organic arsenic are uncertain, although there
was no apparent increase in skin cancers
among patients treated with organic arsenics
for syphillis (3).
Estimates of the dose-response relation-
ship between drinking water arsenic expo-
sure and cancer have been made from
studies conducted in a region of Taiwan
that had artesian well water highly contami-
nated with arsenic. In a well-known house-
hold prevalence survey of skin cancer (4)
published about 30 years ago, villages with
median water arsenic concentrations of 170,
470, and 800 pg/l had skin cancer preva-
lence rates of 26, 101, and 214 per 1000
persons, respectively (4). More recently,
Brown and colleagues (5) performed a
reanalysis of these data using a multistaged
model. A model that included both a linear
and quadratic term in dose improved the fit
only slightly; thus there was no definitive
conclusion regarding the actual shape of the
dose-response curve. Among the limitations
of the Taiwanese study are that data are pro-
vided for the median concentration for all
wells in a village, and in some villages con-
centrations varied considerably, i.e., from
nearly 0 to over 1200 pg/I. Of some reassur-
ance is that data from a study conducted in
Mexico (with similar limitations) (5) also
appeared to fit the model derived from
Taiwan data. Smith and colleagues (6)
modeled standardized mortality ratios of
bladder, liver, lung, and kidney malignan-
cies computed for the endemic region of
Taiwan using rates for the country at large
as the standard. A linear dose-response
relationship was suggested by their analysis.

The risk models derived from the
Taiwanese data indicate that concentrations
below 50 pg/I (the current maximum con-
taminant level for drinking water in the
United States) may be carcinogenic.
Consequently, there is considerable debate
about what levels of arsenic are safe. Part of
the difficulty is that we have limited data
for the United States at levels found in the
United States. The assessment of cancer
risk at concentrations below 170 pg/I
required extrapolation (i.e., where actual
data do not exist) and estimates have dif-
fered to some extent based on model
assumptions (e.g., the point of intercept,
consideration of arsenic exposure through
food) and model choice (e.g., multistaged
model or linear regression). Nonetheless, a
small case-control study conducted in Utah
found some evidence of an increased risk of
bladder cancer in relation to drinking water
arsenic, and in this population water con-
centrations of arsenic were primarily in the
10 to 50 pg/l range (7). Previous ecologic
studies conducted in the United States have
not found an association between water lev-
els of arsenic and skin cancer occurrence
(8,9). These results are difficult to interpret
because each of the geographic areas studied
had a broad range of water arsenic concen-
trations. Additionally, one of the U.S.
studies (9) used mortality rates, which is a
poor measure ofoccurrence for skin cancer.
Therefore, to help clarify the risk of
cancer in relation to arsenic exposure in a
geographically defined U.S. population, we
began an epidemiologic case-control study
of nonmelanoma skin cancers in 1993 and
added bladder cancer to our investigation in
1995. Among our major objectives are to
evaluate whether arsenic exposure is related
to an increased risk ofskin or bladder cancer
in the New Hampshire population, to study
methods of quantifying an individual's
arsenic exposure, and to examine the sources
and mechanisms of arsenic's presence in the
drinking water supply.
Study Design
New Hampshire Study
New Hampshire is a rural state with a pop-
ulation of about 1.1 million (1990 U.S.
Census) (10). Private water supplies serv-
ing fewer than 25 individuals or 15 house-
holds are not regulated as part of the U.S.
EPA Safe Drinking Water Act (11) but an
estimated one-third of the New Hampshire
population uses private water. Arsenic is
present in drinking water throughout the
state, with levels as high as 600 pg/I
detected though volunteer testing by the
State of New Hampshire Water Supply
and Pollution Control Commission; 5% of
private wells are estimated to contain
arsenic concentrations above 50 pg/l.
A population-based study of non-
melanoma skin cancer incidence is feasible
in New Hampshire because of the unique
availability of a statewide skin cancer reg-
istry. Nonmelanoma skin cancers are
excluded from virtually all central cancer
registries; therefore, epidemiologic studies
of these malignancies are sparse in the
United States and elsewhere. Yet non-
melanoma skin cancers are considered the
most common cancers in humans (12). As
part of our study, newly diagnosed basal
cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC) of the skin are being
identified through a network of over 90%
of practicing dermatologists and all pathol-
ogy laboratories in New Hampshire and
bordering areas. Routine visits are made to
each physician's office and each pathology
laboratory. Records are reviewed for basic
demographic information, prior history of
skin cancer, and histologic type and
anatomic location of newly diagnosed
BCCs and SCCs of the skin. Although in
situ SCC (including Bowen's disease) is also
associated with arsenic exposure (13), we
were concerned that earlier staged lesions
may be more susceptible to selection fac-
tors, i.e., people with known arsenic expo-
sure may be more likely to seek medical
attention or the physicians themselves more
likely to biopsy and diagnose a lesion.
Therefore, our case-control study includes
only invasive SCC along with BCC.
We are randomly selecting a population-
control group of a comparable age and sex
distribution as the cancer cases from drivers'
license records (for those less than 65 years
of age) and from Medicare enrollment files
(for those 65 years of age and older). Among
the advantages of population-based control
groups (vs clinic or hospitalized patients
with other diagnoses) are that they are less
prone to biases and also permit inference
about exposure prevalence in the population
at large (14).
We were particularly interested in
bladder cancer in New Hampshire because
maps of cancer mortality for state economic
areas in the United States showed that blad-
der cancer mortality rates were in the high-
est 10% throughout the New England
states, including New Hampshire (15). A
case-control study conducted in Vermont
and New Hampshire approximately 20
years ago found that occupational exposure
in the textile and leather industries could
explain only part of this excess (15). For
our study, bladder cancers are ascertained
from the New Hampshire State Cancer
Registry, which operates a rapid reporting
system. By state law, practitioners are
required to provide an initial report of
cancer within 15 days after diagnosis, and a
definite report can follow within 120 days.
To be eligible for our study, both skin and
bladder cancer cases and controls must be
residents of New Hampshire and 25 to
74 years of age. Because our study includes
an individual biologic measure of arsenic
exposure, we have not sought surrogate
responses (e.g., from a spouse, close relative,
or friend) for deceased individuals.
Personal Interview
Those who agree to take part in the study
undergo an extensive in-person interview
covering residence, occupation, medical
history, lifestyle factors (e.g., use of
tobacco), and family history of cancer.
This enables us to control for potentially
confounding factors and to evaluate
whether other individual characteristics
(e.g., smoking) modify the association
between arsenic and skin or bladder cancer.
Also, we examine whether other factors
(e.g., occupational history) are contributors
to arsenic exposure.
Participants are asked to document each
place they have lived and to indicate the
type of water supply (private vs public) for
each residence. Interview questions relating
to their household water supply include the
type of water supply that serves their house-
hold (e.g., public water, shared well, private
well, or spring); the duration of use; type of
supply (for private water supplies; e.g., arte-
sian, shallow, or spring); how many glasses
of water per day are consumed in foods or
beverages from this drinking water supply;
and use of water filters (e.g., what type and
for how long).
Arenic Determinations
The latency period for arsenic and cancer
occurrence is not yet known, but is likely
several years if not decades. For this reason,
we sought a long-term individual measure
of exposure. Arsenic is rapidly cleared from
the blood and excreted in urine. Therefore,
arsenic concentration in these fluids will
reflect relatively recent exposure (e.g., in the
past several hours or a few days). Specific
forms of arsenic can be analyzed in urine
(e.g., inorganic and various methylated
forms), and the fraction of these forms in
urine may reflect individual differences in

STUDY OF ARSENIC AND CANCER RISK
the ability to metabolize arsenic (16).
Arsenic accumulates in hair and nail tissue
by binding to sulffhydryl groups of keratin,
and for this reason, these tissues have been
used to trace arsenic poisoning. Toenail
clippings are routinely used in epidemio-
logic studies because they are relatively easy
to collect and are less susceptible to external
contamination than hair. Toenails provide
a larger sample than fingernails and take
longer to grow. In a sample of nurses tested
twice for arsenic and other trace elements 6
years apart, arsenic was among the most
highly correlated of the elements they ana-
lyzed (a correlation of greater than 0.5)
(17). Measurement of arsenic directly in
water samples is another alternative.
However, at the time our study began, we
were uncertain whether water concentra-
tions varied appreciability over time, i.e.,
seasonally or from year to year. Moreover,
water is only one potential source of expo-
sure. In our small pilot study, the overall
correlation between water and toenail con-
centrations of arsenic was 0.67 (18); how-
ever, half of the samples were drawn from
regions of New Hampshire known to have
relatively high water levels of arsenic. A sig-
nificant correlation between water concen-
trations and both hair and toenail levels of
arsenic was also recently reported by Chiou
and colleagues (19). In this study, genetic
polymorphism in the GSTMJ or GSTTI
loci, which had an effect on the metabolic
forms of arsenic in urine, did not affect nail
or hair concentrations.
For our case-control study, toenail
clipping samples are being analyzed for
arsenic and other trace elements by instru-
mental neutron activation analysis (INAA)
at the University of Missouri Research
Reactor (Columbia, MO) using a standard
comparison approach as described previ-
ously (20). This method reduces and possi-
bly eliminates external contamination.
Matrix-matched quality control samples,
having known arsenic content, and analyti-
cal blanks are analyzed with the samples
and standards. The detection limit for
arsenic measured by INAA is approxi-
mately 1 pg/I. An additional advantage to
INAA is that samples can be analyzed for
arsenic along with other trace elements
hypothesized in experimental studies to
interact with arsenic carcinogenesis (21)
(e.g., selenium, zinc).
Water samples are being tested using a
hydride-generation technique with a high-
resolution inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) (22). Using
this approach, a quantitative estimate of
arsenic is obtained for 99 % of the water
samples. The instrument is a Finnigan
MAT Element (Bremen, Germany) HR-
ICP-MS. Although lower detection limits
are possible, the quantification limit for
samples was set to 0.01 pg/l (0.001 pg/l for
blanks) to avoid excessive washout times.
Levels below 1 pg/l are not suspected of
posing a health risk; therefore, from a prac-
tical perspective it may not be necessary to
measure arsenic at such trace levels.
However, we also are interested in the cor-
relation between toenail and water concen-
trations and arsenic is detectable in all nail
samples. Likewise, we are examining the
geographic distribution of arsenic in water
throughout the state.
Accurate quantification of arsenic
necessitates strict precautions against conta-
mination. All sample preparations and
analyses are carried out in a trace-metal
clean HEPA-filtered-air environment.
Commercially washed (mineral-free) high-
density polyethylene bottles meet U.S. EPA
standards for water collection (I-Chem,
Newcastle, DE); however, we are unaware
of any published data on the performance
of these bottles for arsenic determination.
Therefore, we prepared acid-washed poly-
ethylene bottles in our class 100 clean room
and initially used these on all households
with private wells and on a random sample
of those with public water. Commercial
bottles were used for the rest of the house-
holds because we expected a smaller frac-
tion of public water would have detectable
arsenic. Powderless latex gloves are worn
during the collection and bottles are kept in
a washed sealed plastic bag. Samples of cold
water are taken after running the tap for at
least 1 min to avoid metal precipitation in
the pipes. Samples are immediately placed
back into the sealed bag. Duplicate samples
are drawn on 10% of the households (every
10th interview) throughout the study, and
field blanks are performed quarterly by each
interviewer. To compare the performance
of the two bottle-washing methods, we
tested water from a sample of households
using both types. All bottles are labeled
with identification numbers that do not
reveal the case-control status of the study
participants or whether the sample was a
replicate from the same household. In
addition to these quality control samples,
analytical blanks and potential instrumen-
tal drifts are carefully monitored, and
instrument standardization and repro-
ducibility is performed with certified
standard reference materials.
Water Arsenic Results
In the 793 households tested to date
(Table 1), 41% reported using a private
well or spring (serving 15 or fewer house-
holds or less than 25 individuals). Arsenic
concentrations range from undetectable
(< 0.01 pg/l) to 180 pg/I. Over 25% of the
private wells contained more than 2 pg/l
of arsenic, over 10% were above 10 pg/I,
and 2.5% were over 50 pg/l. In a pre-
liminary analysis of the population
controls, we found that participants resid-
ing in the three major cities of New
Hampshire (Concord, Manchester, or
Nashua) had lower water arsenic on aver-
age (data not shown). However, partici-
pants from these areas comprise only
about 20% of our sample.
A preliminary analysis was performed
on the replicate samples tested thus far.
Simple random effects models were used
to calculate intraclass correlations for the
log transformed arsenic measurements
(23). The intraclass correlation coefficient
for replicate samples was 0.98 and did not
appear to differ by bottle type (i.e., labora-
tory cleaned or commercially cleaned con-
tainers). Given this high correlation, we
concluded that the bottle types yield
highly comparable and reliable results in
our laboratory.

Sample Size and Study Power
Based on existing risk assessment models,
we expect that the relative risks of cancer
associated with low levels of arsenic expo-
sure may be relatively small (i.e., on the
order of 1.5-2.0). We expect to interview
about 1200 BCC cases, 900 SCC cases, 450
bladder cancer cases, and 1200 controls.
With this sample size, we anticipate 80%
power to detect an odds ratio of 1.6, 1.7,
and 1.9, respectively, for BCC, SCC, and
bladder cancer among individuals with the
highest 5% of toenail arsenic concentrations
with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05. At
an alpha of 0.10, the minimum detectable
odds ratios are 1.5, 1.6, and 1.8 for BCC,
SCC, and bladder cancer. The minimum
detectable odds ratios for the highest 2% of
arsenic concentrations are about 2.0 for
BCC and SCC and 2.5 for bladder cancer,
with an alpha of 0.05, and 1.9 and 2.3,
respectively, with an alpha of 0.10. We will
increase our study power by analyzing
continuous variables (i.e., arsenic concentra-
tions) on a continuous scale. For example,
the minimum detectable odds ratio for blad-
der cancer and the highest 2% of exposure is
1.75 based on a linear or quadratic model,
with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.
Summary
We are conducting an epidemiologic study
to investigate the effects of drinking water
exposure to arsenic on risk of non-
melanoma skin and bladder cancer in a
U.S. population. To accomplish this, we
have specifically established a system of
identifying nonmelanoma occurrences in
the general population and utilize the New
Hampshire State Cancer Registry for blad-
der cancer. Using HR-ICP-MS and a
hydride-generation procedure, we are able
to reliably detect arsenic at concentrations
present in over 99% of samples tested. We
are also using a biologic measure of arsenic
exposure (toenail clippings) that, based on
our pilot work, is highly correlated with
water concentrations. We plan to further
evaluate the relation between water and toe-
nail levels in our larger study and to assess
the contribution of other sources of arsenic
exposure such as tobacco smoking and
occupation on toenail levels. Our analysis
of household water samples will also help
clarify the sources and mechanisms of
arsenic presence in the drinking water sup-
ply. As part of the study, we are establishing
a specimen bank of blood and tumor sam-
ples that can be used in future studies to
evaluate potential susceptibility genes or
tumor markers of arsenic exposure. Based
on the projected sample size, we expect that
our study will help fill important gaps in
our knowledge regarding the relation
between arsenic exposure and skin and
bladder cancer risk in the United States.

During 1996, a total of 21,337 cases (8.0
cases/100,000 population) of tuberculosis (TB)
were reported to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) from the 50 states, District
of Columbia, and New York City, and this total
represents a 6.7% decrease from 1995 (8.7
cases/100,000 population).1 Although the number
of TB cases has decreased for 4 consecutive years,
the TB incidence for 1996 exceeded the national
goal of TB elimination. The prevalence of TB
infection remains higher for foreign-born persons
and minority groups, and it remains a significant
public health problem.
Additionally, infected persons who have failed
to complete their TB treatment have fostered the
development of multidrug-resistant strains of the
primary causative agent, Mycobacterium tubercu-
losis. According to the CDC, virtually all new
infections in the country today are contracted
through the aerosol route from infected patients
who are coughing and dispersing infective droplet
nuclei into the air.2 Health care and other workers
exposed to confined and TB-prevalent popula-
tions are at great risk for infection. Before 1990,
outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB were uncom-
mon3; since then, more than 10 outbreaks have
been reported, all in hospitals and prisons in the
STATE OF THE SCIENCE
Characterization of infectious aerosols
in health care facilities: An aid to
effective engineering controls and
preventive strategies
Eugene C. Cole, DrPH
Carl E. Cook, MS
Durham, North Carolina
Assessment of strategies for engineering controls for the prevention of airborne infectious
disease transmission to patients and to health care and related workers requires considera-
tion of the factors relevant to aerosol characterization. These factors include aerosol gener-
ation, particle sizes and concentrations, organism viability, infectivity and virulence, air-
flow and climate, and environmental sampling and analysis. The major focus on attention
to engineering controls comes from recent increases in tuberculosis, particularly the mul-
tidrug-resistant varieties in the general hospital population, the severely immunocompro-
mised, and those in at-risk and confined environments such as prisons, long-term care
facilities, and shelters for the homeless. Many workers are in close contact with persons
who have active, undiagnosed, or insufficiently treated tuberculosis. Additionally, patients
and health care workers may be exposed to a variety of pathogenic human viruses, oppor-
tunistic fungi, and bacteria. This report therefore focuses on the nature of infectious
aerosol transmission in an attempt to determine which factors can be systematically
addressed to result in proven, applied engineering approaches to the control of infectious
aerosols in hospital and health care facility environments. The infectious aerosols of con-
sideration are those that are generated as particles of respirable size by both human and
environmental sources and that have the capability of remaining viable and airborne for
extended periods in the indoor environment. This definition precludes skin and mucous
membrane exposures occurring from splashes (rather than true aerosols) of blood or body
fluids containing infectious disease agents. There are no epidemiologic or laboratory stud-
ies documenting the transmission of bloodborne virus by way of aerosols. (AJIC Am J

eastern United States.4-8 The presence of patients
with active TB near immunocompromised
patients in HIV-dedicated wards has led to infec-
tion of patients with HIV and multidrug-resistant
TB, whose TB cases often go unrecognized. A
nosocomial outbreak of multidrug-resistant M
tuberculosis in Spain during a 45-month period
infected both patients and health care workers.9
In an intensive care unit, 31% of hospital staff
(14/45) who were exposed to an active, undiag-
nosed TB case during a 5-day period were infect-
ed,10 and a prison guard receiving immunosup-
pressive therapy acquired a fulminant and fatal
case of TB from HIV-infected inmates.11 TB has
been declared an endemic and nosocomial infec-
tion in nursing homes.12
TB is a severe infectious disease, predominant-
ly pulmonary, that is caused by M tuberculosis and
Mycobacterium africanum primarily from human
beings and Mycobacterium bovis primarily from
cattle.13 Those infected with HIV are also predis-
posed toward infection with other mycobacteria,
including Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium
intracellulare, and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum.14
TB occurs when airborne droplet nuclei contain-
ing few or even single infectious units bypass the
bronchial mucociliary apparatus to reach and
multiply in the terminal air space.15 Infection in
the lungs commonly begins in the lower division
of the lower lobe, the middle lobe, the lingula, and
the anterior portion of the upper lobes; in most
cases there is a single initial focus, but one fourth
or more of cases show multiple foci.15 Bacilli are
ingested by alveolar macrophages, continue to
multiply, and spread to regional lymph nodes,
where progressive disease may occur rapidly or
after many years. In children and elderly persons,
the primary focus may become an area of advanc-
ing pneumonia.15
In addition to TB, hospital patients and health
care and related workers remain at risk for con-
tracting other infectious airborne diseases in the
indoor environment, to include viral (influenza,
measles, chickenpox), chlamydial (psittacosis),
bacterial (legionnairesâ disease), and fungal
(aspergillosis) infections. The extreme infectious-
ness of airborne measles was demonstrated in an
outbreak in a private pediatric practice, where a
12-year-old boy with measles was subject to vigor-
ous coughing.16 Seven secondary cases occurred.
Four patients had had transient contact with the
patient as he entered or exited, whereas 3 had
entered the office as long as 1 hour after the
patient was gone. Airflow studies subsequently
showed that droplet nuclei were generated
throughout the entire office suite. Personnel
involved in the direct care of patients with respi-
ratory 
diseases 
such 
as 
psittacosis 
from
Chlamydia psittaci or pneumonia from Chlamydia
pneumoniae are at risk of infection by the aerosol
route.17
During a psittacosis epidemic in
Louisiana in 1943, there were 8 deaths among 19
diagnosed infections in nursing attendants.18
The epidemiology of nosocomial legionnairesâ
disease has not been well elucidated. It is estimat-
ed that 10,000 to 15,000 persons get legionnairesâ
disease in the United States each year.19 An addi-
tional unknown number of people are infected
and have mild symptoms or no illness at all.
About 5% to 15% of known cases of legionnairesâ
disease have been fatal. Of 196 cases of nosoco-
mial legionnairesâ disease reported in England
and Wales during 1980 to 1992, 69% occurred
during 22 nosocomial outbreaks.20 Nine percent
of cases occurred at least 6 months before or after
a hospital outbreak. Another 13% were in hospi-
tals where other sporadic cases (but no outbreaks)
were identified. Only 9% occurred at institutions
where no outbreaks or additional sporadic cases
were identified. 
The overall proportion of nosocomial pneumo-
nias caused by Legionella species in North
America has not been determined, although indi-
vidual hospitals have reported ranges of 0% to
14%.20 Because diagnostic tests for Legionella
species infection are not routinely performed on
all patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia in
most US hospitals, these ranges probably under-
estimate the incidence of legionnairesâ disease.
An 850-bed, tertiary-care, university-based hos-
pital was monitored during a period of hospital
construction for the epidemiology of invasive
aspergillosis.21 A sample of 153 patients was mon-
itored by Aspergillus antigen testing and culture,
and 24 cases were found during a 1-year period; of
those, 7 were determined to be nosocomial.
AEROSOL CHARACTERIZATION
An assessment of airborne infectious entities
requires investigation into their generation and
also their particle sizes, aerodynamic properties,
concentrations, infectivity and virulence, and via-
bility with respect to climate factors (temperature,
relative humidity).
Bioaerosol generation
Human source. Most respiratory infections
(mycobacterial, viral) are transmitted by the air-

borne route from human sources through the
inhalation of droplet nuclei. Such droplet nuclei
are small (<6 Âµm) infectious particles of respira-
tory secretions that are aerosolized by coughing,
sneezing, talking, or singing. The CDC estimates
that the size of the droplet nuclei carrying the TB
bacilli is between 1 and 5 Âµm.22
A cough can generate some 3000 droplet nuclei,
as can talking for 5 minutes.15 A sneeze can gen-
erate as many as 40,000 droplets, which can evap-
orate to particles in the 0.5 to 12 Âµm range.23 The
CDC states that the number of mycobacteria that
are expelled into the air from a person with TB
correlates with a number of factors, including the
presence of cough or other forceful expirational
maneuvers and the willingness or ability of the
patient to cover his or her mouth when cough-
ing.24 Particles larger than droplet nuclei that set-
tle out from the air can potentially be resuspend-
ed in the indoor air after decreased size from
droplet evaporation, in combination with an
aerosol-generating activity such as making a bed.
Aerosol chamber studies have demonstrated the
aerial dispersion of Staphylococcus aureus from
the activity of a colonized operating room techni-
cian linked to wound infection in 11 patients.25
Environmental source. Airborne opportunistic
infectious disease microorganisms emanating
from a variety of environmental sources have long
been a concern with respect to nosocomial infec-
tion and hospital infection control practices.
Susceptible health care and related workers are
also at risk for infection with such agents. 
Bacteria that have been implicated in airborne
transmission in health care facilities include
group A streptococci, S aureus, Neisseria meningi-
tidis, and Bordetella pertussis.26 An outbreak of
methicillin-resistant S aureus in an intensive ther-
apy unit was linked to the exhaust ducting of the
adjacent isolation room ventilation system.27
Legionnairesâ disease has occurred from exposure
to aerosols generated from contaminated cooling
towers.28
Additionally, the causative agent,
Legionella pneumophila, has been isolated from
aerosols produced by water faucets and shower
heads,29 by humidifiers and nebulizers,30 and by
squeezing manual ventilation bags.31
Fungi have long been involved in environmental
source 
nosocomial 
infection. 
Sources 
of
Aspergillus spores in health care facilities have
been identified as outdoor construction,32 indoor
construction and ceiling tile,33 air conditioners,34
and contaminated carpet.35 Other potential envi-
ronmental sources of a variety of Aspergillus
species are components of heating, ventilation,
and air-conditioning systems, including contami-
nated filters, condensate, cooling coils, air
intakes, and porous insulation in air ducts. In
addition, aspergillosis in immunosuppressed
patients at high risk has been associated with
other hospital environmental reservoirs, includ-
ing bird droppings in air ducts supplying high-risk
patient areas36 and contaminated fireproofing
material or damp wood. The reported attributable
mortality 
rates 
from 
invasive 
pulmonary
aspergillosis vary, depending on the patient popu-
lation studied. Rates have been as high as 95%
among recipients of allogeneic bone-marrow
transplants and patients with aplastic anemia,
versus rates of 13% to 80% in patients with
leukemia.37
Microbial ecology. Every building has a microbial
ecology, whose potential for human health effects
can be minimized through proper design, con-
struction, operation, maintenance, and cleaning.
Of greatest importance are the extent and persis-
tence of moisture in various structural, finishing,
and furnishing materials. If relative humidity is
uncontrolled, or if leaks, floods, or sewage back-
ups are not readily and properly repaired, the
result is an altered microbial ecology that permits
the amplification (overgrowth) and dissemination
of a number of fungal and bacterial species with
potential for opportunistic nosocomial infection.38
Microorganisms grow in moisture films on a
variety of surfaces and within porous materials.
The amount of free water available to them for
growth on a substrate or microenvironment (such
as wallboard, ceiling tile, carpet) is described as
water activity (aw), the ratio of the vapor pressure
of water in the substrate to the vapor pressure of
free water.39 Increased aw from high relative
humidity, leaks, or floods, if allowed to persist
more than 24 hours, changes the normal ecology
of a microenvironment or entire building, with
microbial competition resulting in the predomi-
nance of one or more organisms with potentially
damaging effects upon materials and health.40
Most fungi have a minimum requirement of aw
of at least 0.88. Some fungi have a lower limit of
0.66 to 0.70, however, which means that they
require less water to germinate and amplify. These
xerophilic fungi are best represented by the aller-
genic, toxigenic, and opportunistically infectious
molds Aspergillus and Penicillium. Conversely,
extremely wet microenvironments, particularly
those with cellulose-based materials (such as dry-
wall, wallpaper, and books), favor the growth of
fungi with high aw, such as Stachybotrys,
Ulocladium,
and Chaetomium.
Stachybotrys
spores are known to contain tricothecene myco-
toxins,41 and exposures have been associated with
pulmonary hemorrhage in babies in contaminat-
ed home environments42 and with decreased
immune function in workers in office buildings.43
Bioaerosol size and aerodynamics
Infectious bioaerosol particles may exist as (1)
single bacterial cells or spores, fungal spores, or
viruses; (2) aggregates of several cells, spores, or
viruses; or (3) biologic material carried by other,
nonbiologic particles.44 Microorganisms span
wide size ranges. In general, infectious microor-
ganisms range from 0.3 to 10 Âµm for bacterial
cells and spores, 2.0 to 5.0 Âµm for fungal spores,
and 0.02 to 0.30 Âµm for viruses. Specific pathogen
sizes include 0.3 to 0.6 Ã 1 to 4 Âµm for M tubercu-
losis;45 0.3 to 0.90 Ã 2.0 to 20 Âµm for L pneumophi-
la,46 2.5 to 3.0 Âµm for Aspergillus fumigatus
spores47; and 0.09 to 0.12 Âµm for influenza virus.48
Most infectious particles generated from human
respiratory sources occur primarily as droplet
nuclei, 0.5 to 5.0 Âµm diameter.49 As droplets are
forcefully expelled from the respiratory tract, they
begin to evaporate and thus change with respect
to mass and aerodynamic diameter. On complete
evaporation, the particles may be small enough to
remain airborne in the indoor air flow. As pointed
out almost 60 years ago, the size of droplet nuclei
depends on the amount of solid matter contained
in the evaporating droplet.50
Microorganisms, however, are hygroscopic, and
so the relative humidity of an indoor environment
can have a dramatic effect on the particleâs aero-
dynamic size, length of time airborne, and viabil-
ity. The last is extremely important, because only
a viable microorganism can initiate an infectious
process. Gravitational, thermal, and electrostatic
fields also affect the aerodynamic behavior.23
Bioaerosol infectivity and virulence
The infectious disease process in an animal host
is a function of microorganism concentration
(infective dose) and virulence (disease promoting
factors) that enable an agent to overcome the nor-
mal physical and immunologic defenses of the
host. For human beings, the initiation of some
microbial diseases requires only small infective
doses because the agents have affinity for specific
tissue and possess one or more potent virulence
factors that render them resistant to inactivation.
For example, infection with airborne Francisella
tularensis (the causative agent of tularemia) is
reported to result from a single microorganism,
whose virulence is associated with a cellular cap-
sule.23 Only a few cells of M tuberculosis, with its
unique and resistant cell wall structure, are
required to overcome normal lung clearance and
inactivation mechanisms in a susceptible host.
Susceptibility increases through long-term expo-
sure and decreased immune function, which may
result from a variety of natural or self-induced
predisposing factors such as aging, crowded living
conditions, heavy smoking, poor nutrition, and
alcoholism. TB epidemics can occur among per-
sons congregated in enclosed spaces, such as
homeless shelters, nursing homes, hospitals,
schools, prisons, and office buildings. Infectivity
and the need for heating, ventilation, and air-con-
ditioning engineering controls for TB were
demonstrated 
more 
than 
30 
years 
ago.
Experiments were conducted that exposed guinea
pigs to air vented from a ward where patients with
TB were receiving drug therapy. During a 2-year
period, 71 of an average of 156 guinea pigs
exposed continuously to the air from a 6-bed TB
ward became infected.51 More recently, the conta-
giousness of M tuberculosis has been reviewed.52
Viral infectivity and virulence are undoubtedly
more readily noticeable to the general public. Each
year, viral influenza epidemics sweep the globe,
some with greater virulence than others. During
major epidemics, influenza hospitalizations for
persons at high risk may increase two to five
times,53 placing health care workers at increased
risk for infection. Small infective doses are thought
to be responsible because of the rapidity with
which the disease spreads throughout a popula-
tion. The natural airborne transmission of respira-
tory infection with the coxsackie A virus type 21
was investigated in 2 groups of adult volunteers.
One was infected with the virus and the other, not
infected and antibody free, was separated from the
first by a double-walled, wire screen 4 feet wide.54
Transmission of infection was demonstrated on
day 6, as a wave of infection swept the previously
uninfected group. Measles is a highly contagious
viral disease that is spread by the airborne route.
The infective dose is small, and as few as 4 doses
per minute from an infected person can initiate an
epidemic.55 Additionally, rubella (German measles)
and varicella (chickenpox) viruses can be readily
spread by aerosols in indoor air.
Airborne fungi, most notably A fumigatus and
other species, pose an extremely serious infec-
tious disease threat to those who are immuno-

compromised as a result of immunosuppressive
or cytotoxic therapy. Hospital outbreaks of pul-
monary aspergillosis have occurred mainly
among patients with granulocytopenia, especially
in bone-marrow transplant units.56 Although inva-
sive aspergillosis has been reported in recipients
of solid-organ (eg, heart) transplants,57 the inci-
dence of Aspergillus infections among these
patients has been lower than among recipients of
bone-marrow transplants, probably because gran-
ulocytopenia is less severe in solid-organ trans-
plant recipients and the use of corticosteroids has
decreased with the introduction of cyclosporine.58
Inherent in the infection process initiated by
the inhalation of infectious droplet nuclei is the
area of deposition within the respiratory tract.
Such deposition is influenced by hygroscopicity,
which causes an increase in the size of inhaled
aerosols through moisture take up as they move
within the airways. Knight59 estimates that a 1.5
Âµm hygroscopic particleâa common size in
coughs and sneezesâincreases to 2.0 Âµm in diam-
eter when passing through the nose and to 4.0 Âµm
in the saturated air of the nasopharynx and the
lung. He further theorizes that the effect of hygro-
scopicity and the resultant particle size change
increase retention in the tertiary bronchioles and
alveolar ducts, an effect that may be significant
for viral aerosols, which are highly infectious for
that part of the lung.
Bioaerosol viability and climate factors
When pathogenic microorganisms leave their
host and are aerosolized, they are potentially
injured 
during 
the 
generation 
process.
Additionally, once airborne they are outside of
their natural habitat and, depending on a variety
of environmental factors, are increasingly subject
to loss of viability with time. Viability can be
defined as the capability of a microorganism to
reproduce. Even if a microorganism remains
alive, if it cannot reproduce it can be considered
nonviable because it has lost the ability to reestab-
lish a population within a defined microenviron-
ment. Factors influencing the survival of
bioaerosols include their suspending medium,
temperature, relative humidity, oxygen sensitivity,
and exposure to UV or electromagnetic radiation.
With a variety of bacteria, Wells and Stone60 gen-
erated data indicating that microorganisms could
remain viable in the airborne state for long
enough to permit their wide dissemination. Once
aerosolized in the indoor environment, microor-
ganisms are subject to lethal desiccation, which
results from an interplay of organism morpholo-
gy, physiology, oxygen sensitivity, and suspending
medium, with varying levels of relative humidity
and temperature, in addition to air movements,
pressure fluctuations, air ions, and other airborne
pollutants.23 Thus the survival potential of any
given microbial pathogen when aerosolized is
unique to that organism under those specific con-
ditions at that particular point in time. An assess-
ment of environmental factors related to bacterial
and viral survival in aerosols has been reviewed.61
Temperature and relative humidity. Temperature
and relative humidity are important factors in
aerosol survival. The effects of varied relative
humidities can be studied only when temperature
is controlled. In particular, many laboratory inves-
tigations have established that the effect of rela-
tive humidity on airborne microorganisms is an
important but unpredictable factor. A study by
Harper62 investigated the survival (for as long as
23 hours) of 4 viruses (vaccinia, influenza A,
polio, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis)
aerosolized at varying temperatures and relative
humidities in the dark. He found that in general
viral survival at each relative humidity was better
at lower temperature than at higher temperature.
In addition, vaccinia, influenza, and Venezuelan
equine encephalomyelitis viruses survived better
at low relative humidity (17% to 25%), whereas
polio viruses showed greatest survival at high rel-
ative humidity (80% to 81%). Another study63
investigated the survival of 3 aerosolized human
respiratory viruses (adenoviruses 4 and 7 and
parainfluenza 3) in static chambers at 3 relative
humidities (20%, 50%, 80%) and found that the
adenoviruses survived better at 80% relative
humidity, whereas the parainfluenza virus sur-
vived better at 20% relative humidity. The studies
were carried out with aerosols with mass median
diameters of about 2.0 Âµm. Davis et al,64 conduct-
ing dynamic aerosol studies with adenovirus 12 at
28Â° to 30Â°C and 89%, 51%, and 32% relative
humidity, found that survival increased as relative
humidity increased and that the same relation-
ship was present for the recovery of the virus from
the lungs of exposed newborn hamsters. Schaffer
et al65 investigated effects of different means of
virus propagation (cell cultures, egg cultures) on
stability of influenza A virus at midrange relative
humidity (50% to 80%) and showed varying sur-
vival to be related to method of propagation. More
recently, Ijaz et al,66 looking at survival of airborne
human coronavirus 229E at different conditions
of temperature (20Â°C and 6Â°C) and relative
humidity (30%, 50%, 80%), found that maximum
survival of the aerosolized virus was extremely
temperature dependent at 80% relative humidity.
Theunissen et al67 demonstrated efficient airborne
survival of Chlamydia pneumoniae at 15Â° to 25Â°C
and high relative humidity.
All these studies, as well as many others, indi-
cate that the role of the environment in the sur-
vival of airborne microorganisms is extremely
complex. For practical application to the control
of airborne infectious agents, research must move
from the laboratory test chamber to the actual
indoor environment with previously developed
standardized techniques and approaches.
ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS
All existing methods of bioaerosol sampling are
potentially applicable to the recovery of infec-
tious disease agents from indoor air. Detailed
reviews of bioaerosol sampling methods are
available.23,68,69 Sampling focuses primarily on the
recovery of viable microorganisms through meth-
ods of impingement, impaction, filtration, cen-
trifugal separation, or electrostatic and thermal
precipitation. All bioaerosol samplers fatally
damage some portion of the total microorgan-
isms collected. Such injury may occur through
impaction onto culture media or other surfaces,
or through sampler wall losses, turbulence in
impingement fluid, or desiccation on filter
media. Organism loss is also related to the rate of
flow of air sampled. A filter method may sample
at a rate of 4 L/min, whereas an all-glass impinger
samples at a rate of 12.5 L/min, a sieve impactor
at 28.3 L/min, a high-volume impactor at 180
L/min, and other high-volume samplers at hun-
dreds or thousands of liters per minute. All sam-
plers must be calibrated for flow rate before use,
and their collection efficiencies must have been
previously established as a function of particle
size and shape.
Collection efficiencies are typically determined
in controlled laboratory studies with particles of
known size and shape under controlled condi-
tions. A laboratory study of collection efficien-
cies of commonly used bioaerosol samplers was
recently published70; the physical factors affect-
ing the performance of bioaerosol samplers, par-
ticularly with respect to the concept of stopping
distance, have been intensively addressed.44
Comparative sampler performance evaluations
have also been conducted under field conditions
with natural aerosols.71 Recent aerosol research
has described the inlet sampling efficiencies of
several commercial bioaerosol samplers, as well
as the design of a single-stage impactor that can
be used to study different sampling and analysis
variables that affect bioaerosol viability, such as
relative humidity, sampling flow rate, and desic-
cation time.72 Such research can be critical in
identifying sampling instruments and techniques
to recover infectious agents that might be partic-
ularly sensitive to collection and are present only
in small numbers in the indoor air, such as per-
haps M tuberculosis. Efficient aerosol sampling
methods and techniques for the collection of M
tuberculosis from indoor air have not yet been
described. Other airborne mycobacteria have
been successfully recovered from the outdoor air,
however, with impactor samplers with specified,
enriched media.73 A variety of aerosol sampling
techniques and analysis procedures that have
been used for the recovery of human viruses
have been reviewed.69,74 The scope of the problem
of sampling for airborne pathogens is exempli-
fied by research results with natural aerosols of
coxsackie A-21 virus.75 It was found that if indi-
viduals harbored 104 median tissue culture infec-
tious dose of virus/ml oral secretions, sneezed
100 times in a closed room (70,000 L), and atom-
ized 5.9 Ã 10â6 ml secretions with each sneeze,
12,000 L of air would have to be sampled to
recover 1 median tissue culture infectious dose
of virus.
Analysis of collected samples is no longer
restricted to the collection of bioaerosols for via-
bility culturing. New techniques commonly used
in the clinical microbiology laboratory now have
application to environmental monitoring, particu-
larly when the goal is demonstration of airborne
infectious agents. A variety of techniques, such as
fluorescent antibody, monoclonal antibody, gene
probe, and polymerase chain reaction, now afford
other isolation and identification and confirma-
tion options, particularly as rapid analysis and
assessment of the indoor air becomes increasing-
ly more important. Polymerase chain reaction in
particular holds tremendous potential for the
rapid and definitive assessment of airborne infec-
tious agents not amenable to recovery by simple
culture techniques, such as viruses, chlamydia,
mycobacteria, and fungi such as Histoplasma.76
Although bioaerosol recovery and rapid analysis
methods and techniques have been addressed,77
much research remains to be done to refine and
standardize those optimal procedures that will
prove effective with respect to the characteriza-
tion of infectious disease aerosols.

RESEARCH NEEDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Model microorganism selection and use
Regardless of laboratory and aerosol test cham-
ber data indicating the effectiveness of specific
engineering controls, such potential applications
must be eventually evaluated in actual indoor
environments. Such studies in unoccupied build-
ings would require the aerosolization of one or
more suitable model or indicator microorganisms.
Such organisms would be required to be nonpath-
ogenic to human beings, to be related to the target
human pathogen, to possess similar aerosol and
inactivation kinetics, and to be recoverable from
the indoor air. The selection of such organisms
would follow the determination from the litera-
ture of potential candidates, with subsequent
chamber characterization in the aerosolized state,
including assessment of potential recovery tech-
niques. For example, Mycobacterium phlei would
appear to be a candidate model organism for use
in evaluating indoor engineering controls for pre-
venting the airborne transmission of TB. M phlei
is nonpathogenic for human beings, is a rapidly
growing and pigmented environmental mycobac-
terium, and has been found to be 10 times more
resistant to UV radiation than virulent M tubercu-
losis.78 Its generation as an aerosol, perhaps in
artificial sputum, would need to be assessed in the
laboratory with respect to its resultant airborne
characterization. Additionally, the appropriate
collection medium and bioaerosol samplers would
also need to be determined.
Similarly, model viruses and their recovery tech-
niques could be selected for use in evaluating
potential engineering controls in indoor environ-
ments. Aerosolized murine influenza viruses have
been used as an infectious respiratory disease
model,79
and poliovirus type 1 and simian
rotavirus SA11 have been used to assess germici-
dal effectiveness of UV light.80 Bacteriophages
have long served as excellent models for disinfec-
tion studies related to the inactivation of human
viruses in water and waste water. Research is
needed to determine which bacteriophages could
serve as models of infectious human respiratory
viruses in indoor air studies aimed at evaluating
engineering controls.
Evaluation of existing engineering controls
Selected model microorganisms and sampling
methods may be used to evaluate existing environ-
mental engineering controls or combinations of
controls for the prevention of airborne transmis-
sion of infectious agents in health care facilities.
Three methods of air quality control are available:
source control, removal control, and dilution con-
trol.81 Source control minimizes contamination
within an occupied space, such as a laminar-flow
bed providing local or source control for a patient
with newly diagnosed TB. Removal control uses
various air-cleaning devices to control particulates
by either active or passive mechanisms. Active
removal involves the use of devices with media fil-
ters or electronic air cleaners, such as the use of
portable high-efficiency particulate air filtration
units in the rooms of patients with TB, whereas
passive removal involves mechanisms such as par-
ticle settling, ion diffusion charging, thermophore-
sis, and coalescence.81 Dilution control involves
the reduction of airborne contaminants by the
introduction of less contaminated air into the
occupied space; this may occur through natural or
mechanical ventilation.
Another air quality control that may be used in
conjunction with other methods of particulate
removal or dilution is UV air disinfection. The
goal of this technique is to inactivate human path-
ogenic microorganisms in droplet nuclei in the air
supplied to occupied spaces harboring potentially
susceptible persons. Although it is recognized that
different microorganisms vary in susceptibility to
UV, the application of the technology to control
airborne TB in health care and other work envi-
ronments has been shown to be of value and is
well described by Riley82 and Nardell.83 The effec-
tiveness of UV combined with a ventilation-filtra-
tion unit has been shown.84
Evaluation of experimental engineering
controls and devices
The research and development of experimental
bioaerosol engineering control technologies may
provide additional means of controlling infectious
disease transmission in the indoor environment.
For example, basic research on the use of pulsed
high electric fields to inactivate microorganisms
indicates the need for investigation of such a tech-
nique for potential applications to control air-
borne microbial contamination in air-handling
systems.85-87
Although a variety of in situ optical techniques
provide a powerful resource for the measurement
of particle size distributions,88 at present none can
differentiate viable biologic particles from nonvi-
able or nonbiologic ones. Dedicated research
efforts aimed at the development of real-time
devices to detect viable particles in nonviable or
nonbiologic airborne particulates could in the
near future allow continuous monitoring and thus
early warning detection or control systems in
health care and other related facilities. Such
devices would theoretically be designed to use
light scattering or other physical means to detect
only 
airborne 
microorganisms 
of 
certain
pathogen groups, such as cells of mycobacteria,
spores of Aspergillus, or perhaps even units of res-
piratory viruses. Further investigation is needed
to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept of
light scattering to differentiate viable biologic par-
ticles from nonviable or nonbiologic ones. Basic
light scattering studies with an electrodynamic
balance have been published.89,90
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION OF
TRANSMISSION OF INFECTIOUS AEROSOLS
An understanding of the factors affecting the
generation, survival, and transmission of infec-
tious aerosols in hospitals and other health care
facilities is crucial to the task of preventing air-
borne-associated nosocomial infection. Ideally,
the mechanisms for minimizing environmentally
related infections should be addressed before-
hand in every aspect of building design, construc-
tion, operation, and maintenance. 
The entire indoor health care environment must
be viewed as a distinct ecosystem, within which
patients interact with a myriad of environmental
occurrences on a continuing basis. To ensure that
these occurrences present no increased risk of air-
borne transmission of infection, a series of basic
environmental management strategies gleaned
from the indoor environment research communi-
ty are recommended. These include source man-
agement, activity management, design interven-
tion, dilution intervention, and cleaning.
Source management
Every airborne infectious agent comes from a
source, whether a human being, an animal, a
material, or a surface. Sources can be managed
either through removal, such as in the case of
mold-contaminated building materials, or modifi-
cation, such as by purging hot water systems to
eliminate Legionella species. Patients with active
TB can be housed in negative-pressure rooms,
required to wear respirators, or placed in laminar-
flow beds until shown to be noninfectious.
Sources can also be managed through a program
of building maintenance that ensures appropriate
and routine inspection of potential sources, such
as air intakes and filter banks; heating, ventila-
tion, and air-conditioning unit components; air
ducts; cooling towers; and hot water systems.
Environmental sources can also be managed
through efficient and routine cleaning practices
that remove potentially infectious particles and
reduce pollutant source reservoirs, such as carpet
and other dust-contaminated surfaces. Recent
research on indoor pollutant sources and sinks
showed positive correlations between airborne
dust mass and airborne bacteria and fungi, carpet
dust mass and carpet dust fungi, and carpet dust
bacteria and airborne bacteria.91 One of the lead-
ing causes of nosocomial infectious aerosol trans-
mission is fungal contamination generated by
nearby construction and renovation. An excellent,
proactive guide to dealing with dust control and
containment from construction, Infection Control
Issues in Construction and Renovation, was
recently published.92
Activity management
Activity management is the process of ensuring
that the building is used for the activities that it was
designed to accommodate. Sometimes when indoor
air pollutants are encountered, it is the result of the
building or section of the building being used for
some other reason than that for which it was origi-
nally designed. Examples include laboratories in
structures that were designed to be offices or living
quarters, or offices in areas that were formerly lab-
oratories. Use of a building in the way that was orig-
inally intended also facilitates and promotes a rou-
tine program of inspection, maintenance, and
cleaning. Such a program can become an after-
thought when a hospital is continually renovating
the existing structure, constructing additions, or
otherwise modifying the built environment.
Design intervention
Buildings and their furnishings need to be
designed so that they can be effectively inspected,
cleaned, and maintained. Design intervention is
important when designing new buildings, as well
as when remodeling an old structure for new use.
Such interventions could include special exhaust
ventilation or other airflow requirements or the
removal and exclusion of certain building or fur-
nishing materials that are particularly susceptible
to microbial contamination, such as ceiling tile
and carpet.
Dilution intervention
Dilution is the process used to make airborne
pollutants less concentrated by replacing conta-

minated air with clean air. Infectious airborne
particles may be moved by air and captured by
air filters. For example, a study was conducted to
investigate the effectiveness of in-room air filtra-
tion with dilution ventilation for control of TB
infection.93 Results showed that ventilation plus
recirculating air filtration could achieve reduc-
tions of droplet nuclei concentrations with 30%
to 90% effectiveness. This, in combination with
source management controls such as treatment
booths and respirators, could significantly lower
transmission potential in high-risk settings.
Similarly, in controlling nosocomial aspergillosis,
high air-exchange rates are the most effective,
particularly in combination with point-of-use fil-
tration.94 A guide to air exchanges per hour and
the time required (in minutes) for removal effi-
ciencies of 90%, 99%, and 99.9% has been pub-
lished.95 The figures of the guide are helpful but
somewhat limited in value, because they assume
perfect mixing of the air within the space and do
not account for the resuspension of particles that
have fallen out and are subsequently stirred up
through activity. As previously mentioned, high
air-exchange rates are most effective when com-
bined with filtration.
Cleaning
Cleaning is the process of identifying, contain-
ing, removing, and properly disposing of contam-
inants from a surface or environment. It is the
final defense in managing indoor environment
contamination. Even if source management,
activity management, design intervention, and
dilution ventilation have all been optimally used
to control infectious aerosols, cleaning is still
necessary, although cleaning should become eas-
ier as each strategy is improved. The importance
of cleaning was demonstrated in a year-long
study of cleaning effectiveness in a multiuse
building without evident problems.96 The routine
use of high-efficiency vacuum cleaners, damp
dusting, and improved cleaning products, partic-
ularly in high-traffic areas, with attention to
events such as leaks and spills, resulted in mean-
ingful decreases in particulate and microbial con-
tamination. After 7 months of improved cleaning
practices and environmental monitoring, the
data showed a significant decrease (50%) in air-
borne dust mass, a 61% decrease in airborne
fungi, a 40% decrease in airborne bacteria and
carpet dust fungi, an 84% decrease in carpet dust
bacteria, and a 72% reduction in carpet dust
endotoxin.
SUMMARY
Control and prevention of the transmission of
airborne infectious agents in the health care envi-
ronment begin with an understanding of their ori-
gins, aerodynamics, survival, and infectivity so
that appropriate engineering controls can be
effectively implemented within an environmental
management framework of preventive strategies
that include source management, activity man-
agement, design intervention, dilution interven-
tion, and cleaning. Such a total-environment con-
cept is absolutely essential to reduce the risk of
nosocomial airborne infection transmission to the
lowest level possible. In particular, hospitals and
other inpatient facilities should ensure that both
infection control personnel and a certified indus-
trial hygienist are involved both before and during
any building renovation and construction.

Abstract. 
 
The Schwann cell myelin sheath is a multila-
mellar structure with distinct structural domains in 
which different proteins are localized. Intracellular dye 
injection and video microscopy were used to show that 
functional gap junctions are present within the myelin 
sheath that allow small molecules to diffuse between 
the adaxonal and perinuclear Schwann cell cytoplasm. 
Gap junctions are localized to periodic interruptions in 
the compact myelin called SchmidtâLanterman inci-
sures and to paranodes; these regions contain at least 
one gap junction protein, connexin32 (Cx32). The ra-
dial diffusion of low molecular weight dyes across the 
myelin sheath was not interrupted in myelinating 
 
Schwann cells from 
 
cx32
 
-null mice, indicating that 
other connexins participate in forming gap junctions in 
these cells. Owing to the unique geometry of myelinat-
ing Schwann cells, a gap junction-mediated radial path-
way may be essential for rapid diffusion between the 
adaxonal and perinuclear cytoplasm, since this radial 
pathway is approximately one million times faster than 
the circumferential pathway.

 myelin sheath is a multilamellar structure that
ensheathes axons in the peripheral nervous system
(PNS)
 
1
 
 and central nervous system of vertebrates,
increasing axonal conduction velocity by restricting the
depolarizing ionic fluxes that generate action potentials to
nodes of Ranvier (Salzer, 1997). In the PNS, Schwann cells
make the myelin sheath, which is composed of two distinct
domains, compact myelin and noncompact myelin, each
containing distinct proteins. Compact myelin contains pro-
tein zero, peripheral myelin protein of 22 kD, and myelin
basic protein. Noncompact myelin, found in paranodes
and in periodic interruptions in the compact myelin called
SchmidtâLanterman incisures, contains myelin-associated
glycoprotein (MAG), the gap junction protein connexin32
(Cx32, also known as 
 
b
 
1 connexin), and E-cadherin
(Scherer, 1996). E-cadherin is localized to adherens junc-
tions by immunoelectron microscopy (Fannon et al.,
1995), and the localization of Cx32 coincides with the loca-
tion of gap junction-like collections of particles by freeze
fracture electron microscopy (Sandri et al., 1982; Tetzlaff,
1982). Although adherens junctions and gap junctions are
typically found between neighboring cells, in the myelin
sheath they join adjacent layers. These radially arrayed
junctions are thus unique examples of how reflexive junc-
tions (Herr and Heidger, 1978; Majack and Larsen, 1980;
Rumessen et al., 1982) may serve a functional role.
In addition to these molecular specializations, there has
been a renewed interest in the electrophysiological func-
tions of myelinating Schwann cells. Although myelinating
Schwann cells are typically characterized as providing rel-
atively static axonal insulation, they also possess several
kinds of ion channels (Chiu, 1991; Sontheimer, 1994; Mi
et al., 1995, 1996), and respond to ion fluxes that accom-
pany axonal action potentials (Lev-Ram and Ellisman,
1995). Moreover, when their contact with axons is dis-
rupted, they develop voltage-dependent sodium and po-
tassium conductances (Chiu, 1991), may become coupled
by gap junctions (Chandross et al., 1996
 
a
 
; Tetzlaff, 1982),
and extend networks of processes that axons use as sub-
strates for regeneration (Reynolds and Woolf, 1992; Son
and Thompson, 1995
 
a
 
,
 
b
 
).
The finding that Cx32 is localized to the incisures and
paranodes, where putative gap junctions have been ob-
served, led us to investigate whether incisures and para-
nodes have functional gap junctions. Such gap junctions
could promote intracellular communication, since reflex-

ive gap junctions could provide a radial pathway directly
across the myelin sheath. This radial pathway could facili-
tate the spatial buffering of extracellular potassium during
action potential activity (Orkand et al., 1966) and the com-
munication between the adaxonal cytoplasm and the nu-
cleus. We used intracellular dye injection into living, my-
elinating Schwann cells ensheathing axons and video
microscopy to demonstrate that functional, reflexive gap
junctions mediate a radial pathway for diffusion of small
molecules across the myelin sheath at incisures and para-
nodes. This radial pathway was also present in myelinating
Schwann cells from 
 
cx32
 
-null mice, indicating that other
connexins participate in forming reflexive gap junctions.
The gap junction-mediated radial pathway may be impor-
tant for rapid diffusion between the adaxonal and perinu-
clear cytoplasm that would take approximately one mil-
lion times longer via a circumferential route.
Materials and Methods
Preparation of Teased Sciatic Nerve Fibers
 
Young adult (7- or 8-wk-old) mice were anesthetized with CO
 
2
 
 and killed
by cervical dislocation. Mouse sciatic nerves were removed and incubated
in an ice-cold, oxygenated, buffered salt solution (137 mM NaCl, 5 mM
KCl, 2 mM CaCl

, 1 mM MgCl
 
2
 
, 29 mM NaHCO
 
3
 
, 1 mM NaHa
 
2
 
PO
 
4
 
, 11 mM
glucose, pH 7.4, at room temperature). To promote the adhesion of teased
fibers and facilitate location of injected fibers after immunohistochemical
processing, fibers were teased into small bundles on 
 
z

1-mm grids in-
scribed on tissue culture dishes with a scalpel blade. Nuclei were visual-
ized after staining with 0.1 
 
m
 
g/ml bis-benzamide (Hoechst; Molecular
Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) in Ringerâs for at least 5 min. Incisures and
paranodes were visualized with polarized light, since they are isotropic
and can be differentiated from anisotrophic compact myelin.
In some experiments, nerve fibers were teased from rat and frog sciatic
nerves. Rats were anesthetized as described above. Frogs were immersed
in ice for 3â5 min and pithed before dissection of the sciatic nerve. In the
case of frog sciatic nerve, fibers were incubated in a buffered salt solution,

Injection of Sciatic Nerve Fibers
 
The perinuclear region identified by bis-benzamide staining was impaled
with intracellular electrodes which were pulled from borosilicate glass
with filament with fine tapers (1-
 
m
 
m shank size near tip; R 
 
5 
 
40â60 mega-
Ohms measured in 3 M K-acetate). For injection, 5 mg/ml 5,6-carboxyflu-
orescein (molecular weight of 376 kD; Molecular Probes, Inc.), Lucifer
yellow (molecular weight of 457 kD; Molecular Probes, Inc.), 10% neuro-
biotin (molecular weight of 323 kD; Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA),
or 3,000 Da rhodamine dextran (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)
were solubilized in a buffered intracellular injection solution consisting of
140 mM K-acetate, 10 mM Hepes buffer, and 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. In
some experiments, 5,6-carboxyfluorescein and neurobiotin were coin-
jected.
Current injection (5â10 nA, 100-ms pulses, 2 Hz for 2â3 min) was used
to iontophoretically inject dye into the perinuclear cytoplasm (model Ax-
oprobe 1A; Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Injections were
considered to be successful if a resting potential below 4 mV and rapid
longitudinal dye diffusion were observed; 
 
z
 
60â70% of injected fibers met
this criteria, and only these fibers were analyzed further.
Pressure injection was used to inject large molecular mass dyes because
iontophoretic injection was unreliable. Pressure injection was delivered at
5â40 psi, 250-ms pulses at 2â3 Hz for 0.5â2 min using a homemade pi-
cospritzer and continuous visual observation. Dye passage through the
high resistance electrodes needed to impale Schwann cells was difficult.
Many injections were judged to have failed, either because dye did not dif-
fuse beyond the nuclear area, or because the electrodes clogged during
the injection. These were not analyzed further.
Neurobiotin Histochemistry and Immunohistochemistry 
of Injected Sciatic Nerve Fibers
 
After some injections, fibers were stained immunohistochemically for
MAG after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with
acid alcohol for 10 min. Fibers were blocked in 5% fish skin gelatin and
0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-MAG
antiserum (Pedraza et al., 1990), followed by rhodamine-conjugated don-
key antiârabbit secondary antibody as previously described (Scherer et al.,
1995). The resulting staining pattern was evaluated using epifluorescence
or confocal microscopy. To ascertain the localization of Cx32, we similarly
immunostained adult rat teased fibers (fixed in Zamboniâs fixative [Zam-
boni, L., and C. de Martino. 1967.
 
 J. Cell Biol. 
 
35:148a] for 30 min) with a
monoclonal antibody for Cx32 (7C6.C7; Li et al., 1997) and a rabbit anti-
serum against E-cadherin (Fannon et al., 1995).
Injected neurobiotin was visualized after fixation in 4% paraformalde-
hyde and permeabilization with acid alcohol. Fibers were blocked in 5%
fish skin gelatin and 0.1% Triton X-100, labeled with 50 
 
m
 
g/ml rhodamine-
conjugated strepavidin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Injected Schwann cells
were then relocated using the etched grid as a guide (see Fig. 1, 
 
C
 
 and 
 
D
 
)
and imaged using confocal microscopy.
In some experiments, the viability of fibers was also evaluated by a live/
dead assay according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Molecular
Probes, Inc.). When viewed with the appropriate fluorescence optics, this
technique stains living cells green (because they internalize and process
calcein AM ester) but not red (because they exclude ethidium bromide
homodimer from the nucleus).
Video Microscopy
 
In most experiments, dye diffusion was recorded with a 40
 
3
 
, 0.75 n.a.,
long-working distance tapered water immersion objective (Achroplan 40;
Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY), a modified Leica epifluorescence mi-
croscope (model DMRX; Leica USA, Deerfield, IL) (Balice-Gordon,
1998) with a low-light level silicon-intensified target (SIT) video camera
(model VE1000SIT; Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) and a PC-based image
processing system (MetaMorph; Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester,
PA). The software used for acquisition automatically noted the time each
frame was acquired. The path of dye diffusion was monitored visually con-
tinuously during injection; images were acquired at variable intervals dur-
ing the injection. In some experiments, images were acquired digitally at
video rates (30 frames/s) during the first few minutes after injection, and a
few experiments were also recorded onto videotape.
Confocal Microscopy
 
After injection and imaging, some living fibers were analyzed using laser
scanning confocal microscopy (model TCS4D; Leica USA) after being re-
located on the etched grid. This analysis typically took place 10â60 min af-
ter the injection was completed. Fibers were imaged using 40
 
3
 
, 1.0 n.a.
and/or 100
 
3
 
, 1.4 n.a. oil immersion objectives. Z series were taken
through the entire fiber at near the limit of resolution. The single confocal
planes near the middle of the z series that contained the widest width of
axon diameter in addition to the myelin sheath were analyzed for the pat-
tern of dye diffusion. Some fibers were subsequently fixed and processed
for neurobiotin staining and/or immunohistochemistry and then analyzed
again by confocal microscopy.
Image Analysis
 
Images were archived onto magneto-optical disks and printed using a dye
sublimation printer (model Phaser 440; Tektronix, Wilsonville, OR). The
pattern of dye distribution after injection was analyzed in single light mi-
croscopic or confocal images by mapping the intensities of pixels in a line
10â20 pixels wide, perpendicular to the long axis of the fiber (MetaMorph
software; Universal Imaging Corp.). At least three regions were sampled
in each image. In fibers judged to have been successfully injected (see
above for criteria), one of two patterns was observed in each fiber ana-
lyzed, regardless of image contrast enhancement or the absolute intensity
of labeling. In some cases, the line intensity histogram included a pair of
single peaks separated by 8â12 
 
m
 
m. In other cases, the line intensity histo-
gram included one or two peaks that were doublets, with each peak within
the doublet separated by 1 
 
m
 
m or less. The distance between the doublets
was compared with the distance between the outermost peak.
The rate of dye diffusion across incisures was measured from ionto-
phoretic injection of myelinating Schwann cells from wild-type and

null mice, in a set of experiments in which images were acquired at 30
frames/s from the onset of injection. Due to the limited spatial and tempo-
ral resolution of light video microscopy, we could not measure the rate of
diffusion within incisures per se. Instead, we analyzed video frames (2â6
frames, 33 ms apart) in which we could clearly see an incisure in the field
and measure the location of the dye front before, during and after the in-
ner collar of cytoplasm filled.
Pharmacological Blockade of Gap Junctions
 
Halothane, octanol, and 18-

Ringerâs immediately before use. Nerve fibers were incubated in AGA for
40â105 min and then were injected iontophoretically with 5,6-carboxyfluo-
rescein and were monitored optically for 1â4 h. All values are reported as

Results
Intracellular Dye Injection and Imaging of Living 
Myelinating Schwann Cells
 
To determine whether a radial pathway exists across the
myelin sheath, mouse sciatic nerves were removed, incu-
bated in physiological salt solution, and then teased into
small bundles. Teased fibers were stained with bis-benza-
mide to identify the Schwann cell perinuclear region (Fig.
1 
 
A
 
, 
 
inset
 
), which contains the largest amount of Schwann
cell cytoplasm (Gould and Mattingly, 1990). Large myelin-
ated fibers were selected for injection, and the perinuclear
region was impaled with a microelectrode (Fig. 1 
 
A
 
) and
injected with fluorescent dyes either by iontophoresis (Fig.
1, 
 
B
 
 and 
 
C
 
) or by pressure. The pathway of dye diffusion
was monitored with epifluorescence microscopy and the
location of injected fibers was mapped using a grid etched
into the bottom of the injection dish (Fig. 1
 
 D
 
). In ionto-
phoresis experiments, Schwann cell resting membrane po-
tential was monitored during and after iontophoretic in-
jection as an index of cell viability. Schwann cell resting
membrane potentials (

33 fibers from
13 mice) were similar to those previously reported (Wilson
and Chiu, 1993) and remained constant or improved dur-
ing the course of the injection. Thus the dissection, injec-
tion, and imaging procedures did not seem to affect the vi-
ability of myelinating Schwann cells.
Low Molecular Mass Dyes Traverse the Myelin Sheath
 
Teased fibers were viewed with polarized light, revealing
the locations of incisures, which are funnel-shaped, isotro-
pic structures that interrupt the anisotropic compact my-
elin (Fig. 2 
 
A
 
). In some fibers, we directly demonstrated
that these isotropic structures are incisures by fixing the fi-
bers and immunostaining them for MAG, which is local-
ized to incisures and the adaxonal surface of myelinating
Schwann cells (Fig. 2 
 
B
 
). Finally, we double labeled teased
fibers with antibodies against Cx32 and E-cadherin, which
were colocalized at incisures and paranodes (Fig. 3). Thus,
incisures can visualize in living teased fibers, and contain
Cx32, MAG, and E-cadherin.
After injection of low molecular mass dyes, such as 5,6-
carboxyfluorescein (376 Da), into the perinuclear region,
we consistently observed a pattern of labeling similar to a
pair of train tracks. Each track consisted of a double line
of fluorescence, the lines separated by an unstained space
that corresponded precisely to the location of compact
myelin (compare Fig. 2, 
 
A
 
 with 
 
C
 
). A similar pattern was
observed when dye was injected by iontophoresis (
 
n
 
 
 
5 
 
30/
33 fibers from 13 mice) or by pressure (
 
n
 
 
 
5 
 
35/40 fibers
from 24 mice). The train track pattern was observed in im-
ages that included the widest diameter of the axon, usually
midway through the depth of the myelinated fiber. Cyto-
plasmic labeling was seen in planes above and below the
planes containing the train track pattern (Fig. 2 
 
D
 
). Al-
though dye diffusion was usually monitored near the site
of injection, in most fibers, dye also rapidly diffused to
each node, filling the paranodal region. The dynamics of
dye diffusion were not routinely monitored in this location
due to its distance from the site of injection, which pre-
cluded the paranodes from being visualized in the same
field as the site of injection. Dye was not observed to pass
from Schwann cells to axons nor to cross nodes of Ranvier
(Fig. 1 
 
C 
 
and Fig. 2 
 
B
 
), as previously reported (Konishi,
1990; David et al., 1993; Dezawa et al., 1998).

The pattern of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein filling indicates
that this dye filled the cytoplasmic space on both sides of
the myelin sheath. To analyze this further, we mapped the
intensities of pixels in line perpendicular to the long axis of
the fiber; this analysis is illustrated in each figure. In fibers
injected with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein (Fig. 2 
 
E
 
), the line in-
tensity histogram showed two peaks, each of which con-
tained a second, inner peak (Fig. 2

sheath separates the inner and outer collars of cytoplasm
filled by dye. These data agree well with the thickness of
the myelin sheath in adult peripheral nerve; the myelin
sheath has been reported to account for nearly 40% of the
total fiber diameter (Friede and Bischhausen, 1980; Ber-
thold and Rydmark, 1995). In the present experiments, the
thickness of the compartment bracketed by double train
tracks was 37

To determine directly whether the double train track
pattern of dye diffusion resulted from dye passing from
the outer/abaxonal collar of Schwann cell cytoplasm to the
inner/adaxonal collar of cytoplasm, the path of dye diffu-
sion was monitored continuously during injection. Se-
lected planes from one such sequence are shown in Fig. 4.
From the onset of injection, dye spread rapidly along the
myelin sheath, initially remaining within the outer/abax-
onal collar near the nucleus (Fig. 4;

). In most fibers, the
dye appeared to collect at nearby incisures (Fig. 4;

), partially filling the inner/adaxonal collar of cy-
toplasm immediately and more completely within a few
seconds (Fig. 4;

). The dye continued to fill
these compartments, with each line becoming progres-
sively brighter in intensity (Fig. 4;

), and also
spread longitudinally, usually reaching the nodes of Ran-
vier within a few minutes. Injections that were monitored
with continuous acquisition onto videotape confirmed the
above sequence of events, and, in addition, showed that

also stains mesaxons, one of
which is seen in this focal

the incisures themselves were labeled as the dye front
moved down the myelin sheath. In some fibers, including
the one illustrated in Fig. 4, light microscopic images of dye
diffusion were obtained using manual gain settings of the
SIT camera, allowing quantitative comparisons of changes
in intensity mapped across the same region of the fiber
over time (Fig. 4; right-hand panels). This analysis con-
firmed that the intensity of the outer and inner cytoplasmic
collars increased over time, and that the inner cytoplasmic
collar filled after the outer one. Thus, the temporal se-
quence of the train track pattern indicates that 5,6-carboxy-
fluorescein diffuses from the outer/abaxonal to the inner/
adaxonal cytoplasm across incisures.
The rate of dye diffusion was estimated in a subset of
iontophoretic injection experiments in which images were
acquired at 30 frames/s from the onset of injection (n 5 6
fibers from 5 mice). This was accomplished by measuring
the difference in the location of the dye front in consecu-
tive images, immediately before and immediately after an
incisure was filled and the train track pattern appeared.
The mean rate of diffusion estimated in this way was
4.25 6 0.49 mm/s, average 6 SEM; range 2.27â6.06). We
could not measure a rate of diffusion within incisures
themselves owing to the limited temporal and spatial reso-
lution of video microscopy.
We also evaluated whether other low molecular mass
compounds known to cross gap junctions also filled the in-
ner/adaxonal collar of Schwann cell cytoplasm. Fluores-
cence from other commonly used compounds, such as Lu-
cifer yellow, propidium iodide, and ethidium bromide, was
not as intense as that from 5,6-carboxyfluorescein, making
it difficult to monitor dye movement by video microscopy.
These dyes also have broad-spectrum emission that inter-
fered with staining in other fluorescence channels. More-
over, since propidium iodide and ethidium bromide are
impermeant to Cx32 channels in transfected cells (Elfgang
et al., 1995), we selected Lucifer yellow and neurobiotin.
Lucifer yellow injected into myelinating Schwann cells
produced a double train track pattern of staining (n 5 6
fibers from two mice; data not shown). Neurobiotin, a
nonfluorescent, low-mass compound that crosses gap
junctions, was coinjected iontophoretically with 5,6-
carboxyfluorescein to monitor the injection (Fig. 5 A).
The fibers were examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5
B). Evaluation of serial single confocal planes through the
z axis confirmed the double train track pattern of labeling
of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein, and demonstrated that this pat-
tern was distinct from cytoplasmic labeling (Mugnaini et
al., 1977; Gould and Mattingly, 1990). Fibers then were
fixed, permeabilized, stained with rhodamine-conjugated
strepavidin to visualize the neurobiotin, and then were
then reexamined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5 D; same
fiber as in AâC), although the structure of the myelin
sheath was distorted by this processing. In nine out of
intensity of the first peak in the doublet representing the outside
collar of cytoplasm and the intensity of the second peak increased
over the first minutes of injection in parallel. Thus, the train track
pattern of labeling is consistent with the diffusion of 5,6-carboxy-
fluorescein from the outer/abaxonal to the inner/adaxonal cyto-
plasm across incisures. Bars, 5 mm.

of an incisure are indicated with an arrowhead and were con-
firmed by viewing the fiber with polarized light. At the onset of
injection, dye immediately fills the outer collar of Schwann cell
cytoplasm. By 15 s, an incisure is labeled and a faint train track is
apparent on one side of the myelin sheath. The train track pat-
tern and incisure are more apparent at 30 s. At longer times (80
and 147 s), more incisures become filled and the train track pat-
tern is seen further away from the injection site, but in this case is
only clearly visualized on the left side of the fiber. Left panels,

of pixels in a line perpendicular to the long axis of the fiber was
mapped at the position indicated by the black arrowheads in the

dye diffusion were obtained using manual gain settings of the SIT
camera so that changes in the line histogram intensity mapped
across the same region of the fiber over time could be compared
in terms of absolute intensity (right panels; 0â255 intensity levels).

12 fibers, both 5,6-carboxyfluorescein and neurobiotin
stained in a double train track pattern, indicating that both
compounds filled the inner collar of Schwann cell cyto-
plasm. Thus, several low molecular mass compounds
known to pass through gap junctions appeared to diffuse
across the myelin sheath.
A small number of myelinated fibers from rats (n 5 12
fibers from seven rats) and frogs (n 5 8 fibers from two
Rana pipiens) were also injected with 5,6-carboxyfluores-
cein. Incisures were present in both species. In both rats
and frogs, a double train track pattern identical to that ob-
served in mice was observed (data not shown), indicating
that the incisures in these species also contain functional
gap junctions.

Subsequent confocal analysis of the same fiber showed a similar

Schwann cell along the length of the fiber. A single confocal
plane, taken at near the resolution limit of the confocal micro-
scope, midway through the depth of the cell adjacent to a node of
Ranvier (right edge) is shown; note that this region is brighter
than the double train track as there is more cytoplasm in this lo-
cation. There is a doublet present in each intensity peak shown at
right of photomicrograph. (C) A single confocal plane of z5 mm

to visualize neurobiotin and was then reanalyzed by confocal mi-
croscopy. A single confocal plane is shown, midway through the
fiber, demonstrating that neurobiotin diffusion also results in a
double train track pattern, although the pattern is somewhat dis-
torted by tissue processing. A doublet is apparent in each peak of
the intensity histogram on each side of the fiber. Arrow, location
of an incisure; visualization with polarized light confirmed this.

ation limit at z1,000 Da (Bruzzone et al., 1996), we deter-
mined whether dyes of higher molecular mass would dif-
fuse in a pattern similar to that observed with low
molecular mass compounds. Pressure injection was used to
inject large molecular mass dyes because iontophoretic in-
jection was unreliable. Dye passage through the high resis-
tance electrodes was difficult, and many injections were
judged to have failed, either because dye did not diffuse
beyond the perinuclear region or because the electrodes
clogged during the injection (n 5 six out of nine injections
from six mice). When 3,000-Da rhodamine-conjugated
dextran was successfully injected into the perinuclear re-
gion (n 5 three fibers from three mice), dye spread longi-
tudinally in a similar fashion to 5,6-carboxyfluorescein, ex-
cept that fluorescence was not observed in the inner collar
of Schwann cell cytoplasm. Even after allowing 1â4 h for
additional diffusion (Fig. 6 A), dye remained confined to
the outer collar of Schwann cell cytoplasm. Subsequent
confocal analysis of the same fibers verified the absence of
a double train track pattern of dye labeling (Fig. 6 B). Im-
age analysis of intensity mapped along a line perpendicu-
lar to the long axis of injected fibers showed that no dou-
blet in the intensity peaks was observed in any of the
injected fibers (Fig. 6, A and B, bottom). Similar results
were obtained in rats (data not shown) after injection of
3,000-Da fluorescein-conjugated dextran (n 5 three fibers
from two rats) or 10,000-Da rhodamine-conjugated dex-
tran (n 5 two fibers from one rat). Thus, low molecular
mass, but not high molecular mass, compounds diffuse ra-
dially across the myelin sheath.
Dye Diffusion Across the Myelin Sheath Is Prevented by 
Pharmacological Blockade of Gap Junctions
To further evaluate whether functional gap junctions were
present in incisures, teased nerve fibers were incubated in
1â10% halothane, 1â100 mM octanol, or 1â100 mM AGA,
all of which have been shown to block gap junctions
(Davidson and Baumgarten, 1988; Bruzzone et al., 1996;
Goldberg et al., 1996; Goodenough et al., 1996). Schwann
cell toxicity was assayed by measuring resting potential
and by visually determining whether structural changes in
the membrane occurred during the incubation. In some
experiments, a fluorescence assay was used to evaluate cell
viability, by the criteria of exclusion of ethidium bromide
homodimer from the nucleus and internalization and pro-
cessing of calcein AM ester which results in cytoplasmic
labeling (live/dead assay, Molecular Probes, Inc.). These
three criteria were used to evaluate Schwann cell viability
in the course of these experiments.
Incubation in .1% halothane or .1 mM octanol rapidly
induced loss of resting potential, widening of incisures,
and disorganization of the Schwann cell membrane (data
not shown). Teased fibers maintained in 1â100 mM AGA,
however, retained their structural integrity, internalized
and then processed calcein AM ester, and excluded ethid-
ium bromide homodimer from the nucleus for more than
4 h. Thus, these concentrations of AGA did not appear to
be toxic, and 75 mM AGA was used for subsequent exper-
iments. Nerve fibers were incubated in 75 mM AGA for
40â105 min, then injected iontophoretically with 5,6-car-
boxyfluorescein and monitored optically for 1â4 h. In pilot
experiments, we determined that 30â40 min of incubation
in AGA was required to block radial dye transfer in myelin-
ating Schwann cells. The length of time required is proba-
bly due to the geometry of the myelin sheath as well as the
probable inaccessibility of putative gap junctions to bath
applied AGA. In addition to retaining their structural in-
tegrity, myelinating Schwann cells incubated in AGA had
resting potentials near the normal range (28.1 6 1.6 mV,
n 5 15 fibers from seven mice). Myelinating Schwann cells
incubated in AGA did not have a double train track pat-
tern after dye injection (n 5 six or seven fibers from five
mice); the dye remained in the outer collar of cytoplasm
(Fig. 7, A and B) and no doublet in the intensity histogram
was observed (Fig. 7, A and B, bottom panels). Nerve fi-
bers incubated in 0.15% DMSO (the carrier solution used
to dissolve AGA) for a similar length of time also had rest-
ing potentials near the normal range (2 9.5 6 1.1 mV, n 5
11 fibers from six mice), but 11 out of 11 fibers showed the
double train track pattern after dye diffusion, which was
confirmed by the presence of a doublet in the intensity his-
togram on at least one side of the fiber (Fig. 7 C). Thus,
AGA prevented dye from filling the inner collar of
Schwann cell cytoplasm, suggesting that functional gap

junctions within incisures mediate the diffusion of dye into
the inner collar of cytoplasm.
Dye Diffusion across the Myelin Sheath in
Cx32-null Mice
Since Cx32 is the only gap junction protein known to be
localized to incisures, we evaluated the possibility that
Cx32 is necessary for the diffusion of small molecular mass
dyes across the myelin sheath by injecting myelinating
Schwann cells from cx32-null mice. We teased myelinated
fibers from 4-mo-old mice, when few sciatic fibers are de-
myelinated (Anzini et al., 1997; Nelles et al., 1996; Scherer
et al., 1998), avoiding any fibers that appeared abnormal,
and injected them with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein by ionto-
phoresis. When viewed with polarized light, myelinated fi-
bers in cx32-null mice had incisures, which was confirmed
by MAG-immunostaining (Scherer et al., 1998). The mean
resting potential (26 6 3 mV) in myelinating Schwann
cells from cx32-null mice was similar to that observed in
wild type mice. Double train tracks of fluorescence (Fig. 8,
left) and doublets in each peak of the line histogram analy-
sis (Fig. 8, right) were observed in all of the successfully in-
jected fibers (n 5 six fibers from three mice). Moreover,
the mean rate of diffusion was estimated to be 4.09 6 0.67
mm/s (n 5 five fibers from three mice; average 6 SEM;
range 2.02â7.58). This rate is not significantly different
from that observed in myelinating Schwann cells from wild
type mice (Studentâs t test). Thus, the absence of Cx32
does not appear to affect the radial pathway of dye diffu-
sion across the myelin sheath, indicating that there are
functional gap junctions in the incisures of cx32-null mice.
Discussion
The results of our injections provide the first functional
evidence that gap junctions mediate a radial pathway of
diffusion across the myelin sheath. Low molecular mass
compounds diffused rapidly across the myelin sheath, from
the outer/abaxonal cytoplasm to the inner/adaxonal cyto-
plasm, whereas high molecular mass compounds remained
confined to the outer/abaxonal cytoplasm. Furthermore,
the inner/adaxonal cytoplasm was not labeled after injec-
tion of low molecular mass compounds in the presence of
pharmacological blockers of gap junctions. The gap junc-
tions mediating the diffusion of low molecular mass dyes
are probably localized in SchmidtâLanterman incisures,
since these structures appear to fill with 5,6-carboxyfluo-
rescein during injections, contain Cx32-immunoreactivity
(Bergoffen et al., 1993; Chandross et al., 1996a; Scherer

ing Schwann cells from wild-type mice, a train track pattern is ap-
parent on at least one side of the axon. Bar, 10 mm.

et al., 1995), and small gap junctions by freeze-fracture
electron microscopy (Sandri et al., 1982; Tetzlaff, 1982).
These results are summarized in Fig. 9, which is a sche-
matic view of dye diffusion in myelinating Schwann cells
after perinuclear dye injection. One myelinating Schwann
cell has been unrolled to reveal the regions of compact
myelin, incisures, and paranodes. The continuous lines
represent rows of tight junctions; two or more rows form a
circumferential belt around the perimeter of the cell and
are also found in incisures (Tetzlaff, 1978; Shinowara et al.,
1980; Sandri et al., 1982; Stolinski and Breathnach, 1982).
These tight junctions are probably leaky, since they are
not well developed as in tight epithelia (Friend and Gilula,
1972; Claude and Goodenough, 1973). Gap junctions are
depicted as ovals and are found between the rows of tight
junctions. The left Schwann cell has been injected with a
low molecular mass compound, which we demonstrated
diffused across incisures to fill the inner collars of
Schwann cell cytoplasm. This resulted in a double train
track pattern whose width closely matched the width of
the myelin sheath. The right Schwann cell has been in-
jected either with a high molecular mass compound or
with a low molecular mass compound in the presence of a
pharmacological blocker of gap junctions. In both cases,
the dye diffused within the outer collar of Schwann cell cy-
toplasm, but did not reach the inner collar of cytoplasm.
Functional Significance of Gap Junctions in the
Myelin Sheath
The importance of gap junctions in the myelin sheath was
not known until mutations in Cx32 were shown to be asso-
ciated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX),
the eponym for dominantly inherited neuropathies (Ber-
goffen et al., 1993). CMTX is the second most common
form of inherited demyelinating neuropathy, and more
than 130 mutations in Cx32 have been described (Bone et
al., 1997). The importance of Cx32 in the Schwann cell my-
elin sheath may owe to its unique geometry: the unrolled
spiral of myelin membrane may be as long as 4 mm,
whereas it is less than 4 mm in the radial dimension (Friede
and Bischhausen, 1980). A radial channel through the my-
elin sheath would thus be roughly 1,000 times shorter than
the circumferential pathway. This difference translates to
a million-fold shorter diffusion time, since diffusion in a
plane is proportional to the square of the distance (Berg,
1983). It is possible that this pathway may be compromised
in CMTX, in which the failure of ions and small molecules
to diffuse across the myelin sheath damages myelinating
Schwann cells and their axons, resulting in demyelination
and axonal loss (Rozear et al., 1987; Sander et al., 1998;
Hahn et al., 1990).
Using video microscopy, we estimated that the rate of
radial diffusion of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein across incisures
was z4 mm/s. This raises a potential problem, because if
the rate of diffusion within incisures (circumferentially,
within the cytoplasm) was 4 mm/s, then circumferential dif-
fusion of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein should have been ob-
served by 4 h in the myelinating Schwann cells that were
incubated in AGA. We could not measure the rate of dif-
fusion within the incisures, however, and this may be sub-
stantially slower than 4 mm/s. Our observation that a
3,000-kD fluorescent dye also does not reach the adaxonal
cytoplasm within 4 h provides additional support for this
explanation.
We observed that the myelin sheaths of cx32-null mice
have a radial pathway for diffusion that does not appear to
be significantly slower than that observed in wild-type
mice. The presence of functional gap junctions in cx32-null
mice indicates that myelinating Schwann cells express at
least one other gap junction protein, and perhaps several.
One candidate is Cx46, although Cx46 has only been
shown to be expressed by denervated Schwann cells
(Chandross et al., 1996a,b); whether myelinating Schwann
cells also express Cx46 remains to be demonstrated. An-
other candidate is Cx43 (Chandross et al., 1996a; Scherer
et al., 1995; Yoshimura et al., 1996), although this con-
nexin has not yet been localized to incisures or paranodes.
The other putative connexin(s), however, is not sufficient
to preserve the functional or structural integrity of myelin-
ating Schwann cells, as cx32-null mice develop a demyelin-
ating neuropathy (Anzini et al., 1997; Scherer et al., 1998).
This could be an indication that the gap junctions formed
by other connexins are not permeant to the same mole-
cules as gap junctions formed by Cx32 (Elfgang et al.,
1995). Alternatively, Cx32 can interact with other connex-
ins, forming heteromeric hemichannels and heterotypic
channels that may have different voltage sensitivities and
conductances (Bruzzone et al., 1996), so that both connex-
ins may be required to form the proper channels in myeli-
nating Schwann cells.
Our work provides the first demonstration of the func-
tional importance of incisures, which are an ancient and
fundamental adaptation of the myelin sheath. The gap
junction plaques observed within incisures and paranodes
may play a functional role in intracellular communication.
Because of the unique geometry of myelinating Schwann
cells, reflexive gap junctions across the myelin sheath are
likely to be important for communication between the
adaxonal cytoplasm and nucleus. In the absence of Cx32,
intracellular communication mediated by the remaining
gap junction proteins may be compromised, leading to de-
myelination and axonal damage.

The toxic effects of acute mercury vapor inhalation
have been described
1). The clinical picture evolving may
be divided into three phases. The initial phase is man-
ifested as
a
flu- like
illness. The
intermediate
phase
involves a period in which severe multi- organ symptoms
may manifest. The late phase consists of a period when
central nervous symptoms persist. Rare cases with very
high
acute
exposure
to
mercury
vapor
have
been
reported, in which severe respiratory symptoms dominate
the clinical picture
2 ). The cause of death in all lethal cases
is
progressive
respiratory failure
and
the
pathologic
findings in the lungs at autopsy reveal various stages of
acute lung injury, similar to those found in the acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3 ).
We report the findings in a patient with severe mercury
inhalation injury who manifested all the three phases of
the clinical picture, including ARDS, and yet survived with
treatment using corticosteroid and penicillamine.

On admission day, a 72-year- old man had attempted
illicit use of mercury- lead amalgam to treat hemorrhoids.
This procedure was done in a closed room of his house.
He became ill with paroxysmal cough, dyspnea, chest
pain, nausea and vomiting, but he was unaware of the
cause
of
his
illness.
He
was
admitted
and
then
progressively developed dyspnea and respiratory failure.
Routine blood chemistries were unremarkable with the
exception of arterial blood gases at room air, which
revealed pH 7.533, PaO2
25 mmHg, and PaCO2 21
mmHg. His initial chest roentgenogram was normal. On
the
second
day
after
exposure,
chest
radiography
revealed bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (Fig. 1. Top)
and bilateral air- space consolidation on high resolution
computerized tomography of chest (HRCT), especially in
the dependent portion (Fig. 1. Bottom). Transbronchial
lung biopsy revealed a chemical pneumonitis, suggestive
of pulmonary change of early acute lung injury induced
by the exposure to mercury vapors (Fig. 2). The initial
urinary mercury concentration was 6402 ug/L. On the
third day after exposure to mercury vapor, therapy was
initiated
with
mechanical ventilation
and
intravenous
methylprednisolone
pulse
(500
mg/day)
for
3
days,

followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) and oral D-
penicillamine (1500 mg/day) for 7 days. The follow- up
chest X- ray showed a much- improved state (Fig. 3. Top)
and follow- up urinary mercury concentration was 25.6
ug/L. Follow- up arterial blood gases at room air revealed
PaO2
64.9
mmHg, PaCO2
31 mmHg, pH 7.48. He
improved daily. But on the 16th day after exposure to
mercury vapor, he
became
disoriented. On
physical
examination,
his
mental status
was
disoriented
and
auscultation revealed fine crackle bilaterally. Brain MRI
showed old cerebral infarction in the right frontal lobe,
and a follow- up HRCT in chest showed interstitial fibrosis
of both lung fields, especially in the dependent portions
(Fig. 3. Bottom). He was treated with second intravenous
methylprednisone pulse (500 mg/day) for 3 days and then
oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg). Dyspnea improved slightly
but
his
mental
status
was
aggravated.
Pulmonary
symptoms showed a steady state, but mental status did
not improve. He was discharged on the 21st day against
medical advice.

MERCUR Y INHALA TION POIS ONING AND ACUTE LUNG INJUR Y
D IS C US S IO N
Elemental mercury vapor is absorbed rapidly through
the alveolar membrane and transported by blood to the
brain and other parts of the nervous system
1). Mercury is
rapidly converted to mercuric ions (Hg
+ +), which are then
excreted in the urine and feces. Elimination of elemental
mercury occurs primarily in the urine with a half- life of
about 60 days. After oxidation, elemental mercury may
act as mercuric ion or divalent mercury and thus may be
identical
to
the
chemical
form
that
occurs
after
dissociation of mercuric salts. The danger of mercury
vapor is similar to that of ingestion of mercuric chloride or
the mercurial diuretics. The same areas of the brain are
affected by both inorganic and organic mercury. The
tremor, rigidity, truncal unsteadiness and impaired gait
may
produce
a
Parkinsonian
syndrome
suggesting
involvement of the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.
Involvement of the corpus callosum may be indicated by
performance
on
tests
showing
no
improvement
on
switching to the preferred from the nonpreferred hand.
Defects in memory suggest involvement of the temporal
lobe.
A
urine
excretion
level of
300mg/L
probably
represents mercury poisoning ; 100 mg/L of mercury in
urine requires treatment and levels of 50 mg/L or lower
are considered safe. However, urinalysis
often yields
unreliable results and normal levels have not been clearly
established as yet. In our case, the
urinary mercury
concentration was 6408 ug/L, a level representing acute
mercury intoxication.
A clinical picture evolves that may be divided into the
following three phases:
1) The initial phase (first few days
after exposure) is manifested as metal fume fever or a
flu- like
illness
characterized
by
chills,
fever,
aching
muscles, dryness in the mouth and throat and headache.
Toxic pneumonitis with respiratory failure complicate the
picture to revese cases, such as the case presented. The
intermediate phase (symptoms present 2 weeks after an
accident) can be defined as the period during which
severe multiorgan symptoms
(central nervous system,
respiratory tract, gastrointestinal and renal systems) may
be manifested. In the respiratory tract, mercury vapour
acts as a direct airway irritant and a cellular poison. In
mercury vapour inhalation, death
has
occurred from
respiratory
failure.
Postmortem
studies
have
shown
severe
damage to the
bronchi and bronchioles
with
marked alveolar edema
2 ).
In the presence of necrosis,
complications such as interstitial emphysema, pneum-
omediastinum and pneumothorax can occur
4 ). The late
phase
involves
the
period
when
central
nervous
symptoms persist and other organ symptoms resolve.
Thus, acute exposure to elemental mercury and its vapor
induce acute inorganic mercury toxicity and can cause
long- term, probably irreversible, neurologic sequelae. The
clinical course of our case showed all three phases.
The pathologic studies show that the histologic picture
varied in accordance with how long each patient survived
postinsult. Kanluen et al
3 ). reported that the pathologic
findings in the lungs at autopsy reveal various stages of
acute lung injury. In our case, at 5 days
postinsult,
transbronchial lung biopsy showed early acute lung injury,
characterized
by
slight
pneumocyte
hyperplasia
and
intra- alveolar fibrin clot with hyaline membrane formation.
The consolidation areas on radiograph were predom-
inantly arranged in edematous interstitium. There was
also the deposition of gray- black granular pigments in the
alveolar septae, highly suggestive of mercury pigments. A
minimal interstitial neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltrate
was also present. At 16 days postinsult, HRCT showed
moderated air space
consolidation and markedly in-
creased
interstitial
fibrosis,
especially
in
previously
edematous portions. Also, emphysema was present in
the upper lung field. Lung biopsy was not performed due
to the patient's altered mental status. These histologic
changes are similar to changes described in the adult
respiratory distress syndrome from other causes
2 ).
The therapeutic aspect of our case also deserves
mention. Corticosteroids have been used sporadically, as
reported in the literature
2 ). The response to corticosteroids
may
have
been
coincidental given the
absence
of
response in the adult respiratory distress syndrome in
previous studies. In contrast, we saw beneficial positive
response in our case. It has been suggested that steroids
may prevent progression to severe interstitial fibrosis if
used in mildly affected patients. But the progression of
late stage occurred rapidly as we tapered the steroid.
The
effectiveness
of chelating agent for mercury-
induced pulmonary toxicity remains unclear. Penicillamine
is generally accepted as an effective chelating agent for
mercury
5 ). Dimercaptopropanol (BAL) is
also effective;
however, penicillamine has the advantage of oral admin-
istration and is possibly more potent. D- penicillamine, as
an oral compound, may be useful in the less severe
symptomatic inorganic and elemental mercury inhalation
exposures, but its actual value remains to be determined
by clinical studies. D- penicillamine
reverses

binding in the blood and chelates both mercury and lead.
N- acetyl- d,L- penicillamine has been administered suc-
cessfully
to
patients
with
inorganic
mercury- induced
neuropathies
(tremor,
ataxia)
and
chronic
elemental
mercury toxicity
1). Although chelation therapy has been
shown to decrease serum mercury concentration, review
of the
literature
shows
that this
has
no
effect
on
progression of acute lung injury. Jaeger et al
6 ) postulated
that
lung tissue
damage
is
complete
and that
the
treatment of serum levels with chelating agents has no
effect on the reversal of lung damage. In Rowens et al
2 )
reports, despite reduction in serum mercury levels with
dimercaprol,
there
was
also
no
reversal
in
the
progression of lung injury and respiratory dysfunction.
Although a number of authors have advocated the use of
N- acetyl- d,L- penicillamine, this modified chelating agent
is not currently available in North America
7 ). Even though
it has
been reported successful chelation, the effec-
tiveness of D- penicillamine therapy remains unclear.
In summary, we report a patient with acute respiratory
distress syndrome after illicit use of mercury vapor for
hemorrhoid treatment, who developed acute
chemical
pneumonitis.

INTRODUCT ION
BehÃ§et's
disease
(BD) is
a
multisystem vasculitis,
probably autoimmune
in origin. It is characterized by
systemic organ involvement, including mucocutaneous,
ophthalmic, neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, uro-
genital, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal system. Vascular
involvement in BD is not uncommon and closely related
with the
prognosis
of BD. BD associated with large
vascular lesions is called ''Angio- BehÃ§et's syndrome"".
Venous occlusions are frequently observed, most com-
monly in the inferior or superior vena cava
1). Occlusion of
both the superior and inferior vena cava was seen and
reported
1 , 2 ).
The treatment of BD with vascular lesions remains
empirical and
palliative, but usually resistant to all
types of treatment. In cases of venous occlusion, the
prognosis
is
relatively favorable
due to the
devel-
opment of collateral veins
3 ). More extensive venous
occlusions
have
further
limited
therapy
and
less
favorable outcome

CAS E REPORT
A 26- year- old woman was admitted for dyspnea,
coughing
and
generalized
edema
for
the
last
5
months. She had a symptoms complex of recurrent
oral aphtous ulcer, genital ulcer, erythema nodosum
like skin lesions, uveitis and positive Pathergy test, and
was diagnosed to have BD according to the diagnostic
criteria proposed by the International Study Group for
BehÃ§et's disease
5 ). She gave no history of smoking,
consumption of alcohol or any drugs. Two years ago,
bypass
surgery was
performed
due
to
deep vein
thrombosis of left lower extremity (Fig. 1, 2). At that
time, she did not follow- up and was not prescribed for
any medication. On physical examination, the patient
was
uncomfortable
and
slightly pale. She
became
dyspneic on supine for the examination. No rash or
lymphadenopathy
was
found.
There
was
marked
edema over the face, neck, both shoulders, anterior
chest and lower extremities. Also, collateral vessels
formation in the anterior chest wall and abdomen were

noticed. Diminished breath sounds were present over
both lung fields. The abdomen was distended and
non- tender, but a fluid wave
and shifting dullness
were present. The liver was palpable 5 cm below the
costal margin, but the spleen was not felt and no
masses were palpable.
Blood tests showed that the white blood cell count
was 10,600 per cubic millimeter, hemoglobin 11.7 g/dL,
hematocrit was 33 percent, and the platelet count was
45,000 per cubic millimeter. The erythrocyte sedimen-
tation rate (ESR) was 35 mm/hour. The values for
blood chemistries were all within the normal limits. She
had no family history of clotting abnormalities and the
routine coagulation tests (prothrombin time and acti-
vated partial- thromboplastin times, bleeding time) and
protein C, protein S, antithrombin III levels were within
normal range. Antinuclear antibody
(ANA), anticar-
diolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant and rheumatoid
factor (RF) were negative. C3, C4 were within normal
limits. IgG, IgA and IgM were 587 mg/dl, 154 mg/dl
and 214mg/dl, respectively. The pleural fluid showed
characteristic findings of transudate.
An X- ray film of the chest showed bilateral pleural
effusion. Computed tomographic
(CT) scan of the
thorax (Fig. 3) demonstrated large amounts of bilateral
pleural effusion and SVC occlusion with prominent
collateral vessels at the chest wall, both axillary areas
and within the mediastinum. Abdominal CT (Fig. 4)
showed ascites and obliterated IVC, except for the
short segment near the heart. Also, many collateral
vessels
were
noted
in
the
splenic
hilar
area,
hepatosplenic
ligament,
retroperitoneum,
mesentery,
both

areas
of
kidney,
both
paravertebral
areas, perirectal area and the whole abdominal wall.

noted.
The patient was treated with prednisolone, diuretics
(furosemide) and anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents.
Intermittent therapeutic thoracentesis of both pleural
effusions were done. However, both pleural effusions
were
not
improved. So, chest tube
insertion was
performed for drainage of refractory pleural effusion.
Thereafter, her general condition did not change and

Hypotension, anuria and shock developed and prog-
ressed despite
medical supportive therapy, and the

DIS CUS S ION
BehÃ§et's disease is a multisystem vasculitis with
mucocutaneous, ophthalmic, neurologic, cardiovascu-
lar, pulmonary, urogenital, gastrointestinal, musculo-
skeletal involvement and other features. Vascular in-
volvement in BD is not uncommon, with an overall
incidence ranging from 7% to 60%, and any large or
small artery, vein or organ may be involved in an
unpredictable
combination
6 ). Vascular involvement in
BD is seen more frequently in male patients
7 ). BD
associated
with
large
vascular
lesions
is
called
''Angio- BehÃ§et's syndrome"" and four types of vascular
lesions are recognized: arterial occlusion, aneurysms,
venous occlusion and varices. Vascular lesions more
commonly involve the venous system than the arterial
systems
(incidence
of venous
system
involvement
between 18- 24% in BD)
8 ).
The most frequent presentation of venous lesion of
BD is
superficial thrombophlebitis
and thrombosis
9 ).
Venous
occlusions
are
frequently
observed,
most
commonly
in the
inferior or superior vena
cava
1).
Thrombosis of the superior or inferior vena cava in BD
has been recognized and frequently reported
10 ,
1 1 ). The
incidence
of
superior
and
inferior
vena
caval
occulsions
reported
in the
literature
are
9.0% and
2.5%, respectively, and they manifested as superior
vena cava syndrome or lower limb edema or would be
life- threatening if not treated promptly
2 ). Occlusion of
both the superior and inferior vena cavae was seen
and reported
12 ).
The
common underlying histopathologic lesion in
BD is nonspecific vasculitis which could involve any
systemic vessel. The pathologic process in the wall of
the blood vessels in BD is a result of immune complex
deposition, leading to complement fixation and ploy-
morphonuclear leukocyte activation
6 ). The character-
istics
of
vasculitis
are
perivascular
infiltrations
of
inflammatory cells, proliferation of vascular endothelial
cells, some tissue necrosis and loss of vascular elastic
fibers. The small and middle- sized arteries and veins
are
mainly
involved
and
the
vascular
involvement
frequently causes arterial aneurysms, arterial occlusions,
venous occlusions and varix formations
1 1 , 12 ).
There are different explanations about the
path-
ogenesis
of
the
vascular
complications
and
the
tendency for thrombosis in BD. Several investigators
conduct
hypercoagulable
state
account
for
clinical
signs such as vascular lesions in patients with BD.
Activation of platelets and coagulation system by the
impairment of the
intima
because of the vasculitis,
immunological in
origin,
results
in
hypercoagulabe
conditions. Some authors suggest that increased blood
viscosity and
decreased
prostacyclin are
important
factors in the formation of thrombosis
1 3 ). It is claimed
that
prostacyclin
synthesis
is
significantly
low
in
patients of BD with vascular involvement. Also, some
suggested that the decreased activity of the fibrinolytic
system may be the probable cause of thrombosis
14 , 15 ).
There
is
a
question as to whether some
proteins
related to coagulation are simply increased as acute
phase
reactants
or as
to whether there
exists
a
hypercoagulable state in BD.
138
A CASE OF BEHÃ§ET'S DISEASE WITH S UPERIOR AND
INFERIOR VENA CA VAL OCCLUSION
Pleural effusion with or without associated chest
pain is usually attributed to pulmonary infarction or an
infectious process and vasculitis of the pleura. In this
patient, both
pleural effusion and
ascites
may be
contributed to the
retrograde
stasis
and
increased
hydrostatic pressure in central large venous systems.
Nonspecific findings of the pleural tissues may provide
evidence that increased venous hydrostatic pressure,
not
pleural involvement
by
BD,
contribute
to
the
development of both pleural effusion.
The treatment of BD with vascular lesions remains
to
be
solved. Treatment varies
from antiaggregant
agents to intravenous anticoagulation, but is usually
resistant to all types
of treatment. Prednisone and
heparin are still used frequently in the treatment of BD.
Colchicine has been recommended, chiefly because of
its antichemotactic activity. Combination of these three
agents
is
believed to
be
the
best therapy. Some
authors suggest that fibrinolytic agents could be used
in
patients
with
venous
thrombosis,
but
aspirin
treatment should not be offered due to low levels of
prostacyclin in BD. The role of cytotoxic agents, such
as cyclosporine- A, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide
in treatment of vascular lesions of BD, is not clear.
In patients with severe collateral insufficiency, surgi-
cal intervention may be considered. The
results of
reconstructive vascular surgery in patients with BD are
not good for venous or arterial lesions as there is a
high incidence of reocclusion. So, surgical treatment
should
be
avoided
in venous
lesions
unless
it is
absolutely necessary
16 ).
In cases of venous occlusion, the prognosis is not
always poor due to the development of collateral veins
and recanalitation
3 ). But, arterial lesions have a less
favorable outcome, as aneurysms may rupture, leading
to death and more extensive venous lesion has limited
therapy and relatively poor prognosis
4 ). To improve the
quality of life and avoid serious vascular complications,
every patient with BD should be followed routinely by
noninvasive
vascular imaging
and
laboratory tech-
niques to evaluate the arterial and venous system.
Early detection and aggressive treatment of peripheral
vein thrombosis are crucial for preventing propagation
of the thrombus to the large vascular system.

Summary We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide with either bleomycin or ifosfamide in
patients with intermediate-prognosis testicular non-seminoma. A total of 84 eligible patients were randomized to receive four cycles of etoposide,
ifosfamide, cisplatin (VIP), or four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP). Intermediate prognosis was defined as any of the following:
lymph node metastases 5-10 cm in diameter, lung metastases more than four in number or > 3 cm, HCG 5000-50 000 IU I-1, AFP > 1000 IU I-'.
The complete response (CR) rates to VIP and BEP were similar, 74% and 79% respectively (P = 0.62). Including the cases in whom viable
cancer was completely resected with post-chemotherapy debulking surgery, the percentages of patients who achieved a no-evidence-of-disease
status were 80% on VIP and 82% on BEP (P= 0.99). In addition, there were no differences in relapse rate, disease-free and overall survival after
a median follow-up of 7.7 years. The 5-year progression-free survival was 85% (95% Cl 74-96%) in the VIP arm and 83% (95% Cl 71-96%) in
the BEP arm, hazard ratio (VIP/BEP) 0.83 (95% Cl 0.30-2.28). The VIP regimen was more toxic with regard to bone marrow function; the
frequency of leucocytes below 2000 ,ul-1 throughout four cycles was 89% on VIP and 37% on BEP (P < 0.001). Our study does not indicate that
ifosfamide is superior to bleomycin in combination with cisplatin and etoposide. The sample size in this study is small as the study was
prematurely discontinued when data became available from a competing study that showed no improved effectiveness of VIP compared with
BEP. Taken together with these data, bleomycin should not be replaced by conventional-dose ifosfamide.

The treatment of metastatic germ
cell tumours with modem
cisplatin-based chemotherapy results in cure in approximately
70-80% of patients (Einhorn et al, 1981; Einhorn et al, 1990).
Factors associated with treatment failure have been analysed in
several large studies and include large tumour volume, the pres-
ence of liver, bone or brain metastases, grossly elevated tumour
markers and an extragonadal primary site, particularly in the medi-
astinum (Einhorn et al, 1980; Bajorin et al, 1988; Mead et al,
1992). Based on these prognostic factors, during the past decade,
clinical
trials have attempted to decrease the toxicity of the
standard of four bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP) cycles in
patients with good-risk disease, or to improve the results by inten-
sifying therapy or by the incorporation of new agents in the
chemotherapeutic regimen in patients with one or more adverse
risk factors. After the demonstration of the effectiveness of ifos-
famide in germ cell cancer and reports on long-term survival of
cisplatin-ifosfamide-based salvage regimens (Loehrer et al, 1988;

for bleomycin in the induction regimen in patients with adverse
prognostic features. Here, we report the results of the randomized
study of four cycles of induction chemotherapy comparing BEP
with cycles comprising cisplatin, ifosfamide and etoposide (VIP),
conducted by the EORTC in patients with intermediate-prognosis
disease. The definition of intermediate prognosis was derived
from the preceding EORTC multivariate prognostic factor analysis
(Stoter et al, 1987).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients were eligible for the study if they had metastatic testicular
non-seminoma with any of the following characteristics: lymph
node metastases 5-10 cm, lung metastases more than four in
number or > 3 cm, HCG 5000-50 000 IU 1-' or AFP > 1000 IU 1-'.
Patients with extragonadal primary tumours or metastatic sites
other than lymph nodes and lung (liver, bone, brain, etc.) were
excluded as they were considered to have a poor prognosis. Other
ineligibility criteria were pure seminoma (unless accompanied by
elevated HCG levels > 200 IU 1-' or elevated AFP levels), prior
radiotherapy or chemotherapy, white blood count (WBC) below
2000 ,ltl',
platelet
count below
100 000 ul-'
or
a
creatinine
clearance below 40 ml min-'.
Patients were randomized to receive four cycles of BEP or four
cycles of VIP. BEP consisted of cisplatin 20 mg m-2 intravenously
(i.v.) on days 1-5 every 3 weeks; etoposide 120 mg m-) i.v. on day

1, 3 and 5 every 3 weeks; and bleomycine 30 mg i.v. on day 1,
weekly for 12 weeks. The VIP schedule was the same concerning
the schedule and dose of cisplatin and etoposide; ifosfamide was
given at 1.2 g m-2 i.v. on days 1-5 every 3 weeks. Before the
infusion of ifosfamide, a bolus of mesna 200 mg m-2 was given,
followed by ifosfamide as a 4-h infusion in combination with
mesna at a dose of 600 mg m-2. After completion of ifosfamide, an
additional dose of mesna 400 mg m-2was administered over the
next 4 h.
If at the start of a treatment cycle the WBC was below 1500 ul-'
or platelets below 50 000 ,ul-', treatment was delayed. Blood
counts were then repeated every 3 days until these thresholds were
reached and retreatment was given. Doses of etoposide and ifos-
famide were reduced by 25% were made if the total WBC was
between 2000 and 3000 ,ul-', and by 50% if the total WBC was
between 1500 and 2000,l- or if the platelet count was between
50 000 and 100 000 p1-'.
Cisplatin, bleomycin and ifosfamide were withheld if the creati-
nine clearance fell below 40 ml min-m. If renal function recovered,
cisplatin was resumed at 75% and bleomycin and ifosfamide at
I 00%. Severe skin toxicity and signs of lung toxicity were reasons
for termination of bleomycin.
After four cycles, patients with normal levels of tumour markers
and no clinical or radiological evidence of any residual lesions
were
classified
as complete
responders and were monitored
without further therapy.
Patients in whom markers were normalized, but who showed
evidence of residual tumour mass, underwent explorative surgery.
The protocol required complete macroscopic resection of all
tumour remnants. Those patients were classified as complete
responders

cancer cells. If viable malignancy was found, and it was consid-

two additional cycles of the protocol chemotherapy. Patients in

elevation of tumour markers,
and/or those who had disease
progression while on chemotherapy, were classified as incomplete
responders. Rising tumour markers or an increase in tumour
volume were considered to indicate disease progression.
Response rates to the treatment regimens were compared using
the two-sided Fisher exact test (Agresti, 1990). The same test was
used for comparing the frequencies of grade 3/4 toxicity. The dose
intensities achieved on the two arms were compared using the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Lehmann, 1975). Survival and time to
progression curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier tech-
nique and compared with a two-sided log-rank test (Kalbfleisch
and Prentice, 1980). A significance level of 0.05 was used.
The randomization was stratified by institute. Approval of the
ethics committee of the participating hospitals was obtained. All
patients gave informed consent.
RESULTS
Between September 1987 and June 1990, 87 patients were entered,
of whom 41 were randomized to BEP and 46 to VIP. Three
patients on BEP (7%) were ineligible: one was because of pure
seminoma histology, one had no testicular cancer, and one had a

patients, three patients on VIP were not evaluable for response as a
result of omitted explorative surgery. The analysis is based on all
eligible patients. However, all randomized patients were included
in the progression-free survival and survival analyses.
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics (age, histology, stage, markers) were well
balanced between the two treatment groups (data not shown).
Overall, 50% of the patients had retroperitoneal lymph node
metastases only, 6% had mediastinal and/or supraclavicular lymph
node metastases, and 43% had pulmonary metastases. According
to the current risk classification (IGCCCG, 1996) 15 (40%) of the
patients on BEP fulfilled the criteria for intermediate-prognosis
disease, nine (24%) qualified for poor-prognosis disease, while
nine patients (24%) had good-prognosis disease. On the VIP arm,
these numbers were: intermediate prognosis 18 (39%); poor prog-
nosis eight (17%); good prognosis 15 (33%). From five patients on
each arm, data were lacking, predominantly LDH values at entry,
to properly classify patients according to the international criteria.
Treatment administered
All but one patient on VIP had four cycles of treatment. This
patient died of massive pulmonary embolism 10 days after the start
of the first cycle of chemotherapy.
The relative dose intensity of the agents over all cycles is listed
in Table 1. The total doses per m2 delivered over all cycles and the
relative dose intensity of etoposide were less in the VIP arm than
in the BEP arm (P < 0.001). A similar, but non-significant trend
was seen in the relative dose intensity of cisplatin (P = 0.095).
Toxicity
The
haematological
toxicity
throughout
the
four
cycles
is
presented in Table 2. The frequency of leucocytes grade 3 and/or 4
toxicity was significantly higher in the VIP arm (P < 0.001). There
was slightly more thrombocytopenia grade 3 and/or 4 in the VIP
arm, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.20). Three
patients on BEP and five patients on VIP had leucocytopenic fever
during the course of their treatment (P = 0.71). One patient on VIP
developed a sepsis. Pulmonary function tests were performed in 32
patients on BEP and in 33 patients on VIP. The carbon monoxide
diffusion capacity declined by a median of 14% from the baseline
value in the patients on BEP, whereas there was no decline in the
patients on VIP. Out of all 38 patients treated with BEP, four devel-
oped clinical symptoms of pulmonary toxicity; two cases had
grade
1 (5%), one case grade 2 (3%) and one case grade 3 (3%)
toxicity. There were no other differences in non-haematological
toxicities between the two treatment arms (data not shown).
Surgery
Post-chemotherapy
surgery was performed in 58 patients: 28
patients treated with BEP and 30 with VIP (Table 3). Histological
findings were essentially the same for the two treatment groups.
Overall, viable cancer was found in 16% of the surgical speci-
mens, mature teratoma in 47% and necrosis/fibrosis only in 33%
(unspecified 4%).
Response
Responses to chemotherapy are listed in Table 4. Of the 38 patients
on BEP, 30 (79%) achieved a complete response to chemotherapy
alone. In the VIP arm, 34 of 46 (74%) achieved a complete
response. This result is not significantly different (P = 0.62). In
addition, one patient on BEP (3%) and three patients on VIP (7%)
had viable cancer completely resected at surgery. Therefore, the
numbers of patients who were rendered disease free (NED) after
chemotherapy plus post-chemotherapy surgery were 31 (82%) on
BEP and 37 (80%) on VIP. Again, there was no difference between
the two arms (P = 0.99).

Progression-free survival
Progression-free survival
After a median follow-up duration of 7.7 years, seven patients
(18%) on BEP and five (1 I %) on VIP relapsed (Table 4). Of these
relapses, three (two on BEP and one on VIP) had occurred in the
nine patients who had viable cancer detected at post-chemotherapy
surgery. Including the patients who progressed during induction
chemotherapy, a total of eight patients (20%) treated with BEP,
and seven (15%) patients treated with VIP developed treatment
failure (P = 0.72). The hazard ratio (VIP/BEP) was 0.83 (95% CI
0.30-2.28). At 5 years, there was 83% progression-free survival
(95% CI 71-96%) in the BEP arm and 85% (95% CI 74-96%) in
the VIP arm. Figure
1 shows the progression-free survival for all
patients.
In the BEP arm, two patients died of malignant disease; on the
VIP arm, one patient died of massive pulmonary embolism 10
days after the start of the chemotherapy. During follow-up, no
patients developed a secondary malignancy.
DISCUSSION
We
investigated
the
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
induction
chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide with either bleomycin
or ifosfamide. Four cycles of VIP were compared with the stan-
dard of four cycles of BEP with 360 mg m-2 of etoposide per cycle.
The study began in 1987. During the course of the study, data
became available from ECOG showing no improved effectiveness
of VIP compared with BEP with 500 mg m-2 of etoposide per
cycle in a study in 304 patients with advanced stage (= poor prog-
nosis) germ cell cancer, according to Indiana criteria (Loehrer et
al, 1993). At that time, 87 patients had been entered into the study
presented here. In view of the outcome reported by ECOG and our
data pointing in the same direction, i.e. no indication of improved
efficacy, but increased toxicity by VIP, it was decided to close
the study.
The final report from the ECOG study with a median follow-up
of 5 years showed that 63% of the VIP-treated patients and 60% of
the BEP-treated patients remained free of disease (Nichols et al,
1998) in our study reported here, we observed a 5-year progression-
free survival of 83% with BEP and 85% with VIP. The fact that
these progression-free survival rates are higher than in the ECOG
study is explained by the fact that we selected a more favourable
prognostic category of patients. This may also be indicated by the
high salvage rate in our relapsing patients, resulting in no more than

related deaths in our study, there was significantly greater myelo-

leucocytopenia at any time during the course of the four cycles was
observed in no more than 37% of patients treated with BEP
compared with 89% of patients on VIP (P < 0.001). Of note, both
treatment arrms included etoposide at a dose of 360 mg m-2 per
cycle, which was used by EORTC during that period.
When we take the results of the ECOG and EORTC together, we
conclude that there is no role for this dose of ifosfamide in the
induction chemotherapy regimen in non-seminomatous germ cell
cancer. Further evidence of the lack of increased efficacy of VIP
over BEP was recently obtained in a collaborative study of the
Medical Research Council (MRC) and EORTC that compared
three closely spaced cycles of bleomycin, vincristine and cisplatin
(BOP) followed by three cycles of VIP, vs four cycles of BEP plus
two cycles of EP, in patients with poor-prognosis disease (Kaye
et al, 1998). In that study, complete response rates to BEP/EP
and BOP/VIP
were 57%
and 54%
respectively
(P = 0.69).
Progression-free survival rates for BEP/EP and BOP/VIP were
60% and 53% respectively.
Recent data have shown that the doses of both ifosfamide and
etoposide can be increased two to three times during multiple
cycles of chemotherapy, when bone marrow support is realized by
repetitive administration of autologous blood progenitor cells
(Bokemeijer et al, 1996). In view of the substantially increased
dose intensity of these two agents, there appears a rationale to
investigate whether the use of high-dose VIP plus autologous
progenitor cell support after each cycle of chemotherapy can result
in
an improved
disease-free
survival
in
patients
with
poor-
prognosis disease according to the current international classifica-
tion, which shows that these patients have less than 50% survival
rate
with
conventional
cisplatin
combination
chemotherapy
(IGCCCG, 1996).
We conclude that the combination of cisplatin, etoposide and
bleomycin remains the standard induction chemotherapy and that
ifosfamide should not replace bleomycin.
