Summary
 
Allelic exclusion is established in development through a feedback mechanism in which the as-
sembled immunoglobulin (Ig) suppresses further V(D)J rearrangement. But Ig expression
sometimes fails to prevent further rearrangement. In autoantibody transgenic mice, reactivity of
immature B cells with autoantigen can induce receptor editing, in which allelic exclusion is
transiently prevented or reversed through nested light chain gene rearrangement, often result-
ing in altered B cell receptor specificity. To determine the extent of receptor editing in a nor-
mal, non-Ig transgenic immune system, we took advantage of the fact that 
 
l
 
 light chain genes
 
usually rearrange after 
 
k
 
 genes. This allowed us to analyze 
 
k
 
 loci in IgM
 
l
 
1
 
 cells to determine
how frequently in-frame 
 
k
 
 genes fail to suppress 
 
l
 
 gene rearrangements. To do this, we ana-
lyzed recombined V
 
k
 
J
 
k
 
 genes inactivated by subsequent recombining sequence (RS) rear-
rangement. RS rearrangements delete portions of the 
 
k
 
 locus by a V(D)J recombinase-depen-
dent mechanism, suggesting that they play a role in receptor editing. We show that RS
recombination is frequently induced by, and inactivates, functionally rearranged 
 
k
 
 loci, as
nearly half (47%) of the RS-inactivated V
 
k
 
J
 
k
 
 joins were in-frame. These findings suggest that
receptor editing occurs at a surprisingly high frequency in normal B cells.
Key words:
receptor editing • recombining sequence recombination • immune tolerance • B 
lymphocytes • V(D)J rearrangements
T
 
he fact that virtually all B cells express a single H and L
chain prompted many studies to elucidate the under-
lying mechanism. One process that clearly contributes to
allelic exclusion is the imprecision of V(D)J rearrangement
that generates a maximum of one in-frame rearrangement
per three attempts (1), but more active feedback processes
are also involved. Classic studies showing the ability of a H
chain transgene (2, 3) or an L chain transgene (4, and for
review see reference 5) to mediate feedback suppression of
H and L chain rearrangements, respectively, established im-
portant paradigms that have been widely accepted. But in
the case of L chain allelic exclusion, this paradigm was
weakened by an increasing number of “exceptions”, in
which ongoing L chain rearrangement occurred despite ex-
pression of functional 
 
k
 
 chain (6–9). Studies with autoanti-
body transgenic (Tg)
 
1
 
 mice suggested that many of the ex-
ceptions to the feedback regulation model of L chain allelic
exclusion could be explained by postulating self-tolerance–
induced receptor editing (10–15). In addition, recent in
 
vitro studies (16–18)
 
 
 
and analyses of autoantibody Ig
knock-in mice (19, 20) have shown that L chain gene re-
ceptor editing can be an important mechanism of B cell
tolerance. Despite these findings, it is unclear how fre-
quently receptor editing is used for tolerance induction in
normal, non-Ig Tg autoreactive B cells, in part because the
extent of autoreactivity in the preselected B cell repertoire
is unknown.
The organization of the 
 
k
 
 locus, with arrangement of V
 
k
 
genes in both sense and antisense transcriptional orienta-
tions, the absence of D region gene segments, and the pres-
ence of several J
 
k
 
 gene segments facilitates sequential, nested
V
 
k
 
-to-J
 
k
 
 rearrangement attempts (for review see reference
21). In developing B cells, these secondary rearrangements
can both rescue receptor expression in cells that fail to
assemble in-frame L chains (1, 22) and rescue autoreactive B
cells from tolerance elimination by replacing rearranged 
 
k
 
genes with new ones that alter specificity (for review see
reference 23). Another way that the organization of the 
 
k
 
locus promotes receptor editing is suggested by the exist-
ence of the conserved element known as recombining se-
quence (RS) in the mouse (or the homologous “
 
k
 
 deleting
element” in humans; reference 24). RS is located

Receptor Editing in Normal B Cells
 
downstream of the C
 
k
 
 exon (25) and has no coding func-
tion (26), but undergoes V(D)J recombinase-dependent
rearrangement that inactivates the 
 
k
 
 locus by deletional re-
arrangements in 
 
cis
 
 (26–28) (see Fig. 1). In an autoantibody
knock-in model system, RS rearrangements can inactivate
functional 
 
k
 
 genes (20), but the extent of RS-mediated re-
ceptor editing in normal B cells remains unknown.
One approach to estimate the extent of receptor editing
in normal B cells is to analyze V(D)J recombinational rem-
nants that are the predicted residue of editing. In mouse B
cells, which contain both 
 
k
 
 and 
 
l
 
 L chain loci, 
 
l
 
 gene rear-
rangement almost always occurs after 
 
k
 
 rearrangement (for
review see references 29, 30). Thus, if an appropriate 
 
k
 
 gene
is not assembled, rearrangement at the 
 
l
 
 locus often follows.
In 
 
l
 
1
 
 B cells, RS rearrangements usually have deleted the
C
 
k
 
 loci (27, 28, 31)
 
 
 
either by recombining to V
 
k
 
s, through
the well characterized heptamer–nonamer recombination
signal sequences (Fig. 1 
 
B
 
), or to heptamer sites in the
J
 
k
 
-C
 
k
 
 intron (Fig. 1 
 
C
 
) (27, 28, 32). Besides destroying the
function of the 
 
k
 
 locus, this latter mode of RS recombina-
tion has two important effects: first, unlike nested V
 
k
 
J
 
k
 
recombinations, it eliminates the C
 
k
 
-associated
 
 cis
 
-acting
enhancer elements that are critical for V
 
k
 
J
 
k
 
 expression and
rearrangement (33–36), and second, it retains any V
 
k
 
J
 
k
 
 join
that was previously adjacent to C
 
k
 
. This physiological
knockout of regulatory sequences required for 
 
k
 
 gene rear-
rangement thus “freezes” the locus, allowing an analysis of
the V
 
k
 
J
 
k
 
 gene that was assembled adjacent to the C
 
k
 
 exon
just before RS and 
 
l
 
 gene rearrangement.
In this study, we have isolated such V
 
k
 
J
 
k
 
 joins from a
large number of individual IgM

l

 B cells and determined
their nucleotide sequences in order to ascertain the extent
to which RS inactivates functional 
 
k
 
 genes in a normal,
non-Ig Tg immune system. The results indicate that in
normal IgM
 
1
 
 B cells RS-mediated receptor editing is in-
duced by and frequently inactivates functionally rearranged
 
k
 
 genes, probably because of immune tolerance.

ers, as well as antisense J
 
k5-specific (59 CTAACATGAAAAC-

from the PCR clones were sequenced over the VkJk joins to
verify the reading frame.
Production of l1 Hybridomas.
Splenocytes from B10.D2nSn/J-
JCkD/1 mice were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine sera plus 50 mg/ml LPS (E. coli LPS; Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO) for 3 d, then fused with NSO-bcl2 (38) my-
eloma cells for fusion 1 or SP2/0 (39) myeloma cells for fusions 2
through 5. Hybridoma supernatants were screened by ELISA for
secretion of micrometer/liter Ig and the lack of k Ig secretion.
Analysis of Hybridoma Ig Rearrangements.
Hybridoma genomic
DNA was digested with EcoRI or BamHI, then fractionated on
0.8% agarose gels, blotted to nylon membrane, and hybridized
with the RS 0.8 (27) or IVS probes (Fig. 1 A). Vk-RS rearrange-
ments were identified by genomic Southern blot analysis using
the RS probe and/or by PCR amplification using primer A and
primer B to yield a PCR product of z255 bps. VkJk-intron-RS
rearrangements were identified by genomic Southern blot analysis
using both the RS and IVS probes and/or by PCR amplification
using primer C (Jk intron, 59 CTGACTGCAGGTAGCGTG-
GTCTTCTAG 39) and primer B, and amplified for isolation and
sequencing using primers A and B. The resulting products were
isolated from 1.8% low-melt agarose gels, cycle sequenced di-
rectly (Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit;
PE Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT) and analyzed using an
ABI 377 DNA Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). To obtain
near full-length sequences of hybridoma 1-2A7, 1-2E11, 2-2H11,
3-15D6, 3-15C4 and 3-17B10 Vk genes, a consensus FWR1
oligo (amino acids 21 through 8; 59 GGTGACATTGTGCT-
GACCCAGTCTCCA 39) was used with antisense Jk-intron oli-
gos for PCR amplification, followed by cycle sequencing of the
products. For hybrids 1-3E8, 2-15E11, 3-7G5, 4-1D2, 1-10A11
and 1-11A4, Vk leader specific oligos (Ig Prime kit; Novagen,
Madison, WI) were used for amplification.
Cloning and Expression of V(D)J Rearrangements for Analysis of H/kL
Chain Pairing.
The H chain V(D)J and the L chain VkJk-RS re-
arrangements from hybridoma 2H11 were genomically cloned as
previously described (40), with the modifications that lZap
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was the cloning vector and the RS and
IVS probes were used to screen clones for the VkJk-RS rear-
rangement. The 6.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing the V(D)J re-
arrangement and the 4.0-kb EcoRI–XbaI fragment containing
the VkJk rearrangement were gel isolated and ligated to pRmSal,
a Cm expression vector (41) and pSV2-neo-Ck, a Ck expression
vector (42) respectively. The H chain from hybridoma 15E11
was cloned by PCR amplification using a leader intron oligo (59
GAACTGGCAGGACCTGAGGTGAAAATGACA 39) and an
oligo that spanned the XbaI site downstream of JH4 (59 CAG-
GCTCCACCAGACCTCTCTAGA 39). The resulting product
was digested with EcoO109I and XbaI and ligated into EcoO109I
and XbaI digested 8-1Cm (40), a Cm expression vector. The
1233
Retter and Nemazee
VkJk-RS rearrangement from hybridoma 15E11 was also cloned
by PCR using a leader intron oligo (59 TGGAATTCCAGGT-
TCTACTGGAGACATTGT-39) and an oligo which spanned
the XbaI site downstream of Jk5 (59 ACGAATTCGTCTA-
GAAGACCACGCTACCT 39). The resulting product was di-
gested with EcoRI and subcloned into a shuttle vector containing
Vk21C leader and promoter elements. An XbaI fragment that
contained the promoter elements, leader, and the 15E11 VkJk re-
arrangement was isolated and cloned into the XbaI site in pSV2-
neo-Ck (42). The 2H11 and 15E11 H and L chain constructs
were then cotransfected into SP2/0 myeloma cells and selected
for expression of IgMk as previously described (40).
IgMk ELISA for Analysis of H/kL Pairing.
Supernatants from
2H11 and 15E11 H and L chain transfectoma clones were assayed
for IgMk expression by ELISA. In brief, goat anti–mouse IgM
(Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) was
diluted in PBS, coated onto 96-well Immulon 2HB plates
(Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA) and incubated at
room temperature for 3 h. Plates were washed five times with
PBS/Tween 20, then incubated with blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5%
BSA, 0.4% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Serial dilu-
tion of transfectoma and parental hybridoma supernatants were
added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were
washed and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti–mouse
k (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) was added and incu-
bated for 2 h. After a final wash, the chromogenic substrate 2,29-
azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma Chemical
Co.) was added in McIlvain’s buffer (84 mM Na2PO4/48 mM ci-
trate, pH 4.6) with 0.005% H2O2 and OD 410 nm was read using
an automated plate reader (Dynatech, Alexandria, VA). Transfec-
toma and hybridoma antibody concentrations were estimated by
comparison to a TEPC 183 (mk) standard curve.
Results
Strategy for the Isolation of Editing Remnants.
To determine
the extent to which RS recombination inactivates func-
tional, in-frame VkJk joins in the preimmune B cell reper-
toire, IgM1l1 splenic B cells were isolated by fluorescence
activated cell sorting and their genomic DNA was analyzed
by the PCR strategy outlined in Fig. 1 C. This cell sorting
strategy should exclude from the template pool cells that
are k1, H chain isotype switched, surface (s)Ig2, or cells of
a sIglo, germinal center phenotype. In a second series of ex-
periments, IgMl secreting hybridomas were isolated and
their k loci analyzed in detail. To simplify these analyses, all
B cells analyzed were heterozygous for a targeted deletion
of the Jk–Ck locus (JCkD/1), in which only a single k lo-
cus and RS allele could rearrange (33). The potential k
gene and RS element rearrangements are depicted in Fig. 1.
Analysis of IgMl Cells Reveals Frequent Receptor Editing.
Genomic DNA from sorted IgMl cells was used as template
for a PCR using a panspecific Vk FWR 3 oligonucleotide
primer, which recognizes z80% of Vk genes (37), together
with an RS-specific primer to amplify VkJk-intron-RS rear-
rangements (Fig. 1 C, primers A and B). VkJk-intron-RS
rearrangements containing Vk genes rearranged to each of
the four functional Jk genes were detected by PCR amplifi-
cation and Southern blotting (data not shown), but VkJk5-
intron-RS rearrangements were most abundant, in part
because their smaller size promoted preferential amplifica-
tion. Amplified VkJk5-intron-RS rearrangements were gel-
purified and cloned, and a total of 52 clones were sequenced
across both the VkJk and the Jk-intron-RS joins (Fig. 2).
These two different recombination joins, present on each
PCR product analyzed, provided markers for uniqueness.
PCR products that were identical to one another, or that
differed by just one nucleotide, were assumed to represent
repeated isolates derived from the same initial template (i.e.,
derived from a single B cell clone). This represents an under-
estimate because the single base changes could have reflected
real differences and because it was possible that some of the
apparent repeats were independent events that happened to
have identity in the portions of the genes studied, but not in
upstream portions of the V genes. In this sample, at least 37
of the 52 clones represented independent events. Analysis of
the VkJk join sequences allowed an assessment of the poten-
tial prior functionality of the VkJk5 joins just upstream of
intron-RS rearrangements. Surprisingly, 15 of the 37 clones
(41%) contained VkJk joins that were in-frame (Fig. 2), and
if the apparent repeats were not excluded 23 out of 52 (44%)
were in-frame.
To verify the analysis of the PCR-amplified VkJk-intron-
RS rearrangements and to increase the sample size, an in-
dependent sampling of VkJk-intron-RS rearrangements
was derived from JCkD/1 splenocytes in the form of B
Figure 1.
RS rearrangements inacti-
vate and preserve VkJk joins. A rear-
ranged, potentially functional k locus (A)
can be silenced by two types of RS re-
combination: Vk-RS (B) or VkJk-intron-
RS (C). Type C retains the prior VkJk
join, and the RS recombination event
eliminates the known cis acting elements
that are critical for efficient rearrangement
and expression, thus freezing the locus
from further VkJk recombination. Also
shown are the intronic recombination se-
quence 1 (IRS1) (32), the intronic (iE)
and 39 kappa (39E) enhancers (35, 36), and
the recombining sequence (RS) (27, 28)
element. Probes IVS (1) and RS 0.8 (27,
28) are indicated by filled boxes.

Receptor Editing in Normal B Cells
cell hybridomas. A total of 133 IgMl-expressing hybrids
were obtained from five separate fusions and their k locus
rearrangements were analyzed. Genomic Southern blot and
PCR analysis revealed that at least 74% of the l1 hybrids
(99 out of 133) had inactivated the wild-type k locus by
RS rearrangements (Table 1), a value in accord with previ-
ous estimates (31, 34). Two hybridomas apparently had un-
dergone inversional Vk-RS rearrangements, as they had
unique restriction fragments that retained the Ck locus as
revealed by the intron (IVS) probe (data not shown), but
scored positive in a Vk-RS PCR (Fig. 1 B). Approximately
25% (26 out of 99) of the hybridomas with RS rearrange-
ments had Jk-intron-RS joins (Table 1), as detected with
primers B and C (Fig. 1 C). Genomic Southern blot analy-
sis of 18 out of 20 hybrids scoring PCR positive for Jk-
intron-RS rearrangements demonstrated that the RS rear-
rangements colocalized with EcoRI restriction fragments
hybridizing with the IVS probe (data not shown), thus in-
dependently confirming the VkJk-intron-RS rearrange-
ment phenotype. VkJk-intron-RS rearrangements from
individual hybridomas were PCR amplified and directly
sequenced, rather than cloned, a procedure that diminishes
potential Taq polymerase-generated mutations. Like the
VkJk-intron-RS PCR clones, most of the VkJk-intron-
RS loci from hybridomas used Jk5, although four hybrido-
mas had rearrangements to upstream Jks, including one to
Jk2 and three to Jk4, suggesting that developing B cells do
not frequently undergo RS rearrangement until all of the
Jks are rearranged. Sequence analysis over both the VkJk
and intron-RS joins clearly showed that each cell line had a
unique sequence at the VkJk join and that, remarkably, 12
of 20 (60%) of the VkJk joins were in-frame (Fig. 3 A).
Diversity of V Gene Usage.
VkJk-intron-RS rearrange-
ments were clearly diverse because at least 32 different Vk
genes representing 11 of the 19 Vk families were identified
among the 57 independent VkJk-intron-RS loci analyzed
(data not shown). This value of Vk gene representation in
the VkJk-intron-RS loci analyzed is most likely an under-
estimate of the diversity because the 59 PCR primer lies in
FWR3 and yields only a short stretch of Vk gene sequence
for interclonal comparison. Despite this limitation, multiple
genes were observed within particular Vk gene families.
For example, within the Vk4/5 family, at least 11 different
genes were represented among the 14 in-frame and 7 out-
of-frame joins (data not shown). In addition, Vk genes were
sometimes found repeatedly in independent VkJk-intron-
RS rearrangements and there was considerable overlap in
usage among hybridoma and PCR clone sequences. 13 of
the hybridomas used Vk genes that were observed in the
Figure 2.
Sequence analysis of (A) productive and (B) nonproductive
VkJk-intron-RS rearrangements from FACS sorted, IgM1l1 splenic B
cells. Vk gene family and Jk gene usage were assigned based on homolo-
gies to expressed VkJk genes (52) or homology searches of Genbank and
the Kabat Ig database. Translated Vk FWR3 (codons 70–88), CDR3, and
Jk5 sequences to the conserved phenylalanine (F) are shown for produc-
tive rearrangements, whereas FWR3 and CDR3 sequences are shown for
nonproductive rearrangements, with the asterisk (*) adjacent to CDR3 in
B denoting an out of frame VkJk join. The nucleotide sequences of the
unrearranged Jk intronic recombining sequence 1 (IRS1) and RS element
(both of which contain a consensus heptamer sequence adjacent to the D
symbol) are shown above the sequences of the IRS1-RS joins present in
each PCR clone. The RS join sequence for clone 17 was not determined.
Underlined nucleotides could have been donated by either the IRS1 or
the RS sequence, and N region addition (bold) and P-encoded nucleotides
are shown between the joins. Repeats denote the number of times a par-
ticular sequence was observed.

pressed distinct Vk genes that were members of families
observed in the PCR clone sample and 1 hybridoma ex-

clone samples (Figs. 2 and 3 and data not shown).
Intron/RS Joins.
The sequences of the Jk-intron-RS
joins in both the PCR clones (Fig. 2) and hybridomas (Fig.
3 B) were quite varied and were dominated by deletions at
both sides of the joins, as up to nine nucleotides were miss-
ing from either the Jk-intron or RS heptamer-flanking se-
quences. There did appear to be a bias for a particular join
(e.g., clone 4, Fig. 2 A), which was observed to be associ-
ated with 13 independent VkJk rearrangements. Two of
the intron-RS joins contained P nucleotides and one con-
tained N-region addition nucleotides, consistent with find-
ings described previously (7, 43).
Rebuilding IgMk Antibodies for Analysis of H/kL Pairing
and Antigen Specificity.
To determine if the high frequency
of in-frame VkJk rearrangements silenced by intron-RS re-
combination was due to the inability of H chains to pair with
their k L chains, the V(D)J and VkJk rearrangements from
hybridomas 2H11 and 15E11 were cloned into Cm and Ck
expression vectors, respectively. These H and L chain con-
structs were cotransfected into SP2/0 myeloma cells to gen-
erate transfectoma clones. Analysis of transfectoma superna-
tants by IgMk sandwich ELISA revealed that the in-frame
kL chains were able to pair with their hybridoma H chains
(Fig. 4), suggesting that ongoing RS rearrangement was not
due to the inability of H/L chain pairing. The specificity of
the mk transfectoma antibodies remains unknown, however.
Attempts in flow cytometry assays to detect recombinant an-
tibody binding to the surfaces of bone marrow cells were
unsuccessful (data not shown).
Discussion
In this report we examined the DNA sequences of VkJk
joins located upstream of intronic-RS rearrangements in
normal, non-Ig Tg B cells to determine the extent to

sequences of Vk FWR, CDR, and Jk se-
quences to the conserved phenylalanine (F)

with * denoting an out of frame VkJk join
and # denoting an in-frame stop codon,
are shown for nonproductive rearrange-

“Repair” of intron-RS recombination-silenced VkJk genes
by restoration of Ck exon and surrounding elements reveals that silenced
kL chains can pair with their original m chain partner. The graph shows
representative results from a mk ELISA comparing several IgMk transfec-
toma antibodies (Tfc) to their IgMl parental hybridoma antibodies (Hyb).
Antibodies in supernatants were captured on plastic using adsorbed anti-m
chain antibodies and revealed with anti-k conjugates. Bars indicate the
SD determined from antibodies assayed in triplicate. The concentrations
of the hybridoma antibodies were at least 10-fold higher than those of the
transfectoma antibodies based on comparison to a TEPC 183 (m, k) stan-
dard curve.

Receptor Editing in Normal B Cells
which RS-mediated recombination silences functionally re-
arranged k genes. Nearly half of all VkJk joins inactivated by
RS recombination were in-frame (27 out of 57). This high
frequency is clearly incompatible with a strict feedback sup-
pression model of L chain allelic exclusion, which predicts
no in-frame VkJk joins upstream of the RS rearrangements.
More strikingly, this high frequency is also significantly
higher than 33%, the percentage of in-frame joins expected
from random VkJk rearrangement, indicating that produc-
tive VkJk rearrangements actively induce intron-RS rear-
rangements. The data also demonstrate a physiological role
for the RS element in normal B cell development—the
inactivation of functionally rearranged k genes.
To understand why we conclude that the RS rearrange-
ments were actively induced by functional k L chains, con-
sider the extreme hypothetical cases of mice in which all k
gene rearrangements result in either autoreactive B cell re-
ceptors or nonproductive k chains (Table 2). If Vk-to-Jk
and RS rearrangements proceed randomly, albeit with dif-
ferent relative frequencies, then in either case VkJk joins
located upstream of intronic-RS rearrangements should be
in-frame at a maximum frequency of one out of three. To
significantly exceed this frequency, in-frame VkJk joins
must stimulate the relative rate of (intronic) RS rearrange-
ment. This argument applies to our data because the ob-
served frequency of in-frame joins, 47.4%, is significantly
higher than one out of three (P , 0.04, single sample test
of a proportion based on a normal approximation). Since it
is exceedingly unlikely that the stimulus for increased in-
frame rearrangements is mediated by anything other than k
protein, and because k chains can probably only be per-
ceived by the signaling machinery of B cells through their
association with H chains, we conclude that functional k
chains actively stimulate the rate of RS rearrangement
based on B cell receptor antigenic specificity. These data
also predict that in mice in which the Ck exon is inacti-
vated, but surrounding cis-acting elements are left intact,
VkJk rearrangement should be extensive, whereas RS rear-
rangement should be reduced. This is in fact the experi-
mental observation (44).
The statistical argument also excludes the possibility that
a high frequency of rearrangeable Vk pseudogenes, L
chains that fail to pair with H chains, or a role for positive
selection is responsible for our results. Furthermore, com-
plete sequencing of the coding regions from all the in-
frame VkJk rearrangements derived from l1 hybridomas
revealed no stop codons or other obvious defects that
would have precluded function (Fig. 3 A). It is also un-
likely that frequent aberrant H/L chain pairing is responsi-
ble for the high frequency of in-frame VkJk joins in the
VkJk-intron-RS rearrangements, as demonstrated by the
ability of H/kL chains from two hybridomas to pair (Fig.
4). Moreover, there are few examples of L chains that fail
to pair with H chains and most experiments suggest that
virtually all random H/L pairs can associate (40, 45–48).
Finally, if a lack of positive selection of surface Ig was re-
sponsible for the high frequency of in-frame joins, this
would predict that B cells should frequently express two k
chains, a result that has not been observed.
The receptor editing events documented in this study
probably do not represent renewed V(D)J recombination
in mature B cells, such as has recently been described in the
germinal center (49–51), because the cells analyzed ex-
pressed high levels of IgM and l chain and because they
were isolated and, in the case of the hybridomas, stimulated
in a manner that should not have induced V(D)J recombi-
nation. Another indication that receptor editing in mature
B cells is unlikely to explain our results is that the fraction
of l1 cells in newly formed and mature splenic B cells is
nearly identical, suggesting that in unmanipulated mice
mature k1 cells rarely give rise to l1 B cells (44). Overall,
it would appear from our data that the RS rearrangements
that we studied were actually stimulated, rather than inhib-
ited, by productive k gene rearrangements, probably as the
result of immune tolerance-mediated receptor editing in
immature B cells. To definitively test the prediction that
the k chains of the cells that we have analyzed generate au-
toantibodies in association with the same cell’s heavy chain,
it will be necessary to generate mice transgenic for these
genes.

Summary
 
We examined the regulation of virus-specific CD8 T cell responses during chronic lympho-
cytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of mice. Our study shows that within the same
persistently infected host, different mechanisms can operate to silence antiviral T cell responses;
CD8 T cells specific to one dominant viral epitope were deleted, whereas CD8 T cells re-
sponding to another dominant epitope persisted indefinitely. These virus-specific CD8 T cells
expressed activation markers (CD69
 
hi
 
, CD44
 
hi
 
, CD62L
 
lo
 
) and proliferated in vivo but were un-
able to elaborate any antiviral effector functions. This unresponsive phenotype was more pro-
nounced under conditions of CD4 T cell deficiency, highlighting the importance of CD8–
CD4 T cell collaboration in controlling persistent infections. Importantly, in the presence of
CD4 T cell help, adequate CD8 effector activity was maintained and the chronic viral infection
eventually resolved. The persistence of activated virus-specific CD8 T cells without effector
function reveals a novel mechanism for silencing antiviral immune responses and also offers
new possibilities for enhancing CD8 T cell immunity in chronically infected hosts.
Key words:
cytotoxic T cells • unresponsiveness • chronic infections • CD4 T cells • major 
histocompatibility complex tetramers
 
C
 
D8 T cells eliminate viruses by killing infected cells
and by producing antiviral cytokines such as IFN-
 
g
 
(1–6). These T cells are of importance in chronic viral in-
fections and several studies have documented a role for
CD8 CTLs in controlling persistent infections of humans
with hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomega-
lovirus (6–11). Also, there is now convincing evidence that
decreased CD8 T cell responses are associated with high vi-
ral burden and poor prognosis in HIV-infected individuals
(12–17). In such chronic infections, continuous presence of
functional CD8 T cells is essential to keep the virus in
check, and loss of CD8 T cell responses can lead to resur-
gence of virus. One condition that results in loss of CD8
responses is CD4 deficiency. Studies with murine models
of chronic viral infections have shown that CD4 T cells are
essential for maintaining CD8 CTL responses (18–20), and
in humans there is a correlation between the decline of
CD4 T cells and loss of HIV-specific CD8 T cell responses
during the progression of AIDS (21). However, it is not
known whether loss of CD8 T cell function under these
conditions is due to deletion of virus-specific CD8 T cells
or due to induction of anergy (unresponsiveness) in these
cells (13, 19, 22–24). It is important to distinguish between
these two mechanisms of silencing immune responses be-
cause this information is critical for designing therapeutic
strategies for enhancing T cell responses in persistently in-
fected individuals.
To address this issue and to investigate the role of CD4
T cells in regulating CD8 T cell responses, we have studied
infection of normal (

mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).

We have used MHC class I tetramers complexed with de-
fined viral epitopes to directly visualize antigen-specific
CD8 T cells and have measured antiviral T cell effector
functions using cytotoxicity and cytokine production assays
(25–27). This approach allows us to simultaneously moni-
tor the physical presence and functional activity of virus-
specific CD8 T cells. Moreover, the use of MHC class I

Silencing CD8 T Cells during Chronic Viral Infection
 
tetramers to identify antigen-specific T cells obviates the
need to use TCR transgenic cells. Viral infections induce
polyclonal antiviral T cell responses directed towards multi-
ple epitopes; therefore, studies with monoclonal TCR
transgenic cells may not mimic the regulation of polyclonal
virus–specific CD8 T cells (4, 10, 22, 28). In this study we
show that antiviral CD8 T cell responses are silenced dur-
ing chronic infections by different mechanisms depending
upon the viral epitope. CD8 T cells specific for the LCMV
nucleoprotein (NP)396–404 epitope were deleted, whereas
CD8 T cells specific to another dominant epitope, glyco-
protein (GP)33–41, persisted indefinitely. These LCMV
GP33–41-specific CD8 T cells expressed activation mark-
ers (CD69
 
hi
 
, CD44
 
hi
 
, and CD62L
 
lo
 
) but were unable to ei-
ther kill virus infected cells or release antiviral cytokines
such as IFN-
 
g
 
. These “unresponsive” cells were found pre-
dominantly under conditions of CD4 T cell deficiency,
documenting the importance of CD4 T cells in maintain-
ing CD8 T cell responses during chronic viral infections.

recombinant IL-2 (50 U/ml) together with irradiated splenocytes
from congenital LCMV carrier mice. After 8 d of culture, the

tissues tested; .106 PFU in spleen, lymph nodes, thymus,
liver, lung, brain, kidney, and salivary gland (Fig. 1 A, data
not shown). Virus-specific CD8 T cells, as measured by
their ability to kill infected cells and to secrete IFN-g, were
present in 1/1 mice but no functional CD8 T cell re-
sponses could be detected in CD42/2 mice. No LCMV-
specific CD8 T cell responses were present in chronically
infected CD42/2 mice either directly ex vivo or after re-
stimulation with virus in vitro. Data from mice analyzed at
day 90 after infection are shown in Fig. 1, B, C, and D.
Epitope-dependent T Cell Deletion and Functional Unrespon-
siveness during Chronic Infection.
To determine if loss of
CD8 T cell responses in chronically infected CD42/2 mice
was due to peripheral deletion of virus-specific T cells or
due to functional unresponsiveness, MHC class I tetramers
complexed to immunodominant LCMV epitopes (GP33–
41 and NP396–404) were used to visualize antigen-specific
CD8 T cells (Fig. 2). Uninfected (naive) and LCMV im-
mune mice (i.e., mice that had undergone an acute LCMV
Armstrong infection) were included as negative and posi-
tive controls. No virus-specific CD8 T cells were detect-
able (frequency ,1/105) in naive mice (Fig. 2, A, E, and I),
whereas immune mice contained GP33- and NP396-spe-
cific CD8 T cells at frequencies of z2% (1/50 CD8 T
cells) and z5% (1/20 CD8 T cells), respectively (Fig. 2, B
Figure 2.
T cell deletion and functional unresponsiveness are distinct
mechanisms for silencing antiviral immune responses. Naive 1/1 mice,
1/1 immune mice (161 d after LCMV Armstrong infection; 2 3 105
PFU, i.p.), and 1/1 or CD42/2 mice infected with LCMV-t1b (2 3 106
PFU, i.v.) 60 d previously were checked for the physical presence and
functional responsiveness of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells. (A–H) LCMV-
specific CD8 T cells were visualized using MHC class I tetramers com-
plexed to viral peptides. Cells were costained with anti-CD8–PE, anti-
CD44–FITC, and either Db(GP33–41) or Db(NP396–404) tetramers
conjugated to allophycocyanin. The histograms show gated CD8 lym-
phocytes, and the percentage of CD8 cells costaining with either
Db(GP33–41) or Db(NP396–404) are indicated in the corresponding up-
per right quadrant. Where not shown values are ,0.2%. (I–L) Numbers
of LCMV-specific IFN-g producing cells were enumerated using single-
cell cytokine ELISPOT assays. The number of splenocytes producing

Silencing CD8 T Cells during Chronic Viral Infection
and F). The tetramer binding cells in LCMV immune mice
were CD44hi, a marker for activated/memory T cells (35),
and all of these antigen-specific cells were fully functional;
z100% of these cells produced IFN-g after stimulation
with the appropriate peptides (Fig. 2 J). 1/1 mice that had
undergone a protracted (4–6 wk) LCMV-t1b infection ex-
hibited a selective deletion of NP396-specific CD8 T cells
(Fig. 2, C and G). These mice still contained GP33-specific
CD8 T cells (Fig. 2 C) at a frequency (1/50) comparable to
that seen in 1/1 Armstrong immune mice and, as in the
immune group, these GP33-specific CD8 T cells were
CD44hi and most of these cells were functional based on
IFN-g production (Fig. 2 K). Thus, 1/1 mice that were
infected for 4–6 wk and subsequently eliminated virus from
most of their tissues had lost their NP396-specific CD8 T
cell responses due to peripheral deletion of these cells but
still retained their GP33-specific responses. An interesting
variation of this phenotype was seen in chronically infected
CD42/2 mice. In these mice, similar to in 1/1 mice,
NP396-specific CD8 T cells were deleted (Fig. 2 H) and
GP33-specific CD8 T cells were present (Fig. 2 D), but in
striking contrast to 1/1 mice, nearly all (.98%) of these
cells were nonfunctional (Fig. 2 L). Although CD42/2 mice
contained as many GP33 tetramer binding cells as 1/1
mice, and these cells were also CD44hi, few if any of these
virus-specific CD8 T cells were able to secrete IFN-g or
kill LCMV-infected cells. Taken together, these results
show that the mechanism of peripheral tolerance during
chronic viral infections can vary depending upon the
epitope specificity of the T cells; in the case of NP396-spe-
cific CD8 T cells, silencing of the response was due to
physical deletion of the antigen-specific cells, whereas for
GP33-specific CD8 T cells, loss of function was due to un-
responsiveness. Most importantly, these data show that vi-
rus-specific T cells can persist during chronic viral infection
but these T cells are incapable of eliciting their normal ar-
ray of antiviral effector functions (i.e., cytotoxicity and
IFN-g production).
In certain conditions (36, 37), immune “deviation” can
occur, resulting in the synthesis of an alternative set of cy-
tokines by responding T cells. To address this possibility,
intracellular cytokine staining was performed. After 6 h
stimulation in vitro with GP33 peptide, freshly explanted
spleen cells from both LCMV-t1b–infected 1/1 mice and
CD42/2 mice failed to produced IL-2, IL-4, or IL-10 (data
not shown). Identical intracellular staining procedures de-
tected significant amounts of IL-4 and IL-10 after in vitro
stimulation of an OVA-specific CD4 Th2 cell clone. How-
ever, IFN-g was produced by spleen cells from LCMV-
t1b–infected 1/1 mice, but splenocytes isolated from sim-
ilarly infected CD42/2 mice did not produce detectable
levels of IFN-g. Thus, during chronic infection, GP33-
specific CD8 T cells do not exhibit an altered pattern of
cytokine production. Moreover, in the absence of CD4 T
cell help, these cells fail to elicit any detectable effector
functions and the viral infection is not resolved.
The kinetics of LCMV epitope–specific responses were
examined during the course of chronic infection to deter-
mine when NP396-specific CD8 T cells were deleted and
when GP33-specific cells became unresponsive (Fig. 3). In
both 1/1 and CD42/2 mice infected with LCMV clone
13 (30), NP396-specific CD8 T cells were deleted by day
50 after infection. After expansion and differentiation into
effectors during the first week after infection, NP396-spe-
cific CD8 T cells became progressively unresponsive and
were then deleted in the periphery. In striking contrast,
GP33-specific CD8 T cells persisted indefinitely. During
the initial phase of infection both groups of mice contained
a mixture of functional and nonfunctional GP33-specific
CD8 T cells. In 1/1 mice, a fraction (10–20%) of these T
cells remained functional and the LCMV infection was
eventually resolved (Fig. 3 A). However, in CD42/2 mice
all the GP33-specific CD8 T cells became nonfunctional
by day 30 and these mice were unable to control the viral
infection (Fig. 3 B). These results show that CD4 T cells
are essential to sustain effector functions of virus-specific
CD8 T cells during chronic infection.
Lack of viral clearance and persistence of unresponsive
GP33-specific CD8 T cells was also seen when 1/1 mice
were made CD4 deficient at the time of infection by in-
jecting them with a monoclonal antibody (GK1.5) to de-
plete CD4 T cells. 1/1 mice were injected with GK1.5 1 d
before and 3 d after LCMV-clone 13 or -t1b infection; this
treatment depleted .95% of the CD4 T cells but within 2
mo these mice had reconstituted their CD4 T cell com-
partment and contained normal levels of CD4 T cells (Fig.
4). However, GP33-specific CD8 T cells remained unre-
sponsive in these mice and there was no control of the vi-
rus infection (Fig. 4). It is particularly noteworthy that al-
though these mice had recovered their total number of
CD4 T cells, they did not contain any detectable LCMV-
specific CD4 T cells as measured by IFN-g and IL-2 pro-
duction (data not shown). These results show that the cru-

mers, and IFN-g ELISPOT assays were performed to determine the func-
tional responsiveness of these cells (GP33–41, j; NP396–404, d). Serum

cial factor in maintaining CD8 T cell function during
chronic infection is not the total number of CD4 T cells
but the presence of antigen-specific helper cells. This find-
ing has obvious implications towards understanding the
regulation of HIV-specific CTL responses (16, 21).
Expression of Activation Markers and Turnover of Unrespon-
sive T Cells.
We next asked whether these effector func-
tion–negative CD8 T cells express activation markers asso-
ciated with TCR signaling. These T cells were CD44hi
(Fig. 2 D) and also expressed low levels of CD62L (data not
shown). This phenotype, CD44hiCD62Llo, is characteristic
of activated/memory T cells and shows that these function-
ally “unresponsive” cells were antigen experienced (35,
38). However, neither of these two markers is indicative of
recent TCR stimulation. To examine this we checked ex-
pression of the very early T cell activation marker, CD69.
CD69 is rapidly upregulated after TCR-mediated signaling
but its expression is transient and dependent upon continu-
ous TCR activation (39–41). We found that the vast ma-
jority (z80%) of effector-function–negative GP33-specific
CD8 T cells were CD69hi (Fig. 5 A). This rather striking
result shows that these CD8 T cells are cognizant of the
continued presence of viral antigen and are receiving sig-
nals through their TCR but fail to elaborate downstream
effector functions. Even after treatment with PMA and
ionomycin, agents that activate protein kinase C and ele-
vate intracellular Ca21 levels, respectively (42, 43), GP33-
specific CD8 T cells in chronically infected CD42/2 mice
were unable to secrete IFN-g (Fig. 5 B). Since these virus-
specific CD8 T cells are maintained indefinitely in persis-
tently infected CD42/2 mice, we checked whether these
cells were turning over in vivo by BrdU incorporation (26,
32). Chronically infected CD42/2 and 1/1 mice (100 d
after infection) were given BrdU in the drinking water for
8 d and the percentage of cells that had replicated during
this period was determined by staining for BrdU incorpora-
tion in the nucleus, in combination with cell surface stains
(CD8 and tetramer) to identify the T cells. A representative
analysis is depicted in Fig. 5 C showing that the “unrespon-
sive” GP33-specific CD8 T cells do proliferate in vivo.
Discussion
The main point of this study is that virus-specific CD8 T
cells can persist indefinitely in chronically infected hosts.
These T cells express activation/memory markers (CD44hi
CD62Llo), are receiving signals through the TCR (CD69hi),
and can proliferate in vivo, but are unable to elaborate anti-
viral effector functions and thus fail to control the infec-
tion. Although T cell unresponsiveness (anergy) has been
extensively studied, cells of such a phenotype have not
been described previously (44–51). Moreover, the identifi-
cation of these activated but effector-function–negative T
cells reveals a new mechanism of silencing antiviral im-
mune responses during chronic infections. These CD8 T
cells seem to be engaged in a continual and ineffective ef-
fort much like the Greek king, Sisyphus, who was con-
demned forever to perform the fruitless task of pushing a
large stone up a hill only to see it roll down again. Our
studies show that these “Sisyphean” CD8 T cells are gener-
ated under conditions of chronic antigenic stimulus and are
especially prevalent when there is inadequate CD4 help.
Until now, deletion (exhaustion) of virus-specific CD8 T
cells has been considered as a more general mechanism of
tolerizing virus-specific immune responses during chronic
infections (13, 22–24). Our studies documenting persis-
tence of effector-function–negative antigen-specific CD8
T cells open new possibilities of therapeutic intervention
for enhancing CD8 T cell immunity in chronically infected
hosts. In addition, this study shows that within the same
persistently infected host different mechanisms can operate
to silence antiviral T cell responses; LCMV NP396-specific
cells were deleted, whereas GP33-specific cells were main-
tained indefinitely but without any detectable CTL or cyto-
kine secretion activity. Thus, strategies to enhance immune
function during chronic infection need to be tailored to-
wards individual epitopes.
In contrast to the strong correlation between CD4 help
and CD8 T cell effector function, we found an inverse cor-
relation between antigen persistence and responsiveness of
virus-specific CD8 T cells. Of the three LCMV strains used
in this study, clone 13 causes the most disseminated and

stained for CD4 and the activation marker CD44. The percentage of CD41 cells are indicated in the upper quadrants. By this time point, both 1/1 and
GK1.5-treated mice contained comparable numbers of CD4 T cells. (C) Splenocytes from GK1.5-treated mice were prepared at 60 d after infection with
LCMV-t1b and both the total number (measured by tetramer staining) and the number of IFN-g–secreting (measured by ELISPOT) GP33- or NP396-
specific CD8 T cells were determined. Greater than 98.5% of GP33-specific T cells were unresponsive and NP396-specific T cells were not detectable. In
A and C the limit of detection is indicated by the dashed line. At least three mice were analyzed at each time point.

Silencing CD8 T Cells during Chronic Viral Infection
persistent infection with the highest antigen load, followed
by LCMV-t1b and then Armstrong, which only causes an
acute infection (Figs. 1 and 3 and reference 19). During the
course of acute LCMV Armstrong infection (which only
lasts about a week) and after viral clearance, all of the
GP33-specific CD8 T cells remained functional (Fig. 2 and
reference 26). In LCMV-t1b–infected 1/1 mice (viral
clearance in z2 mo), z60% of the GP33-specific CD8 T
cells were unresponsive during the first month after infec-
tion, but by day 90 all of these cells had become functional
(Fig. 2 and data not shown). However, in clone 13–
infected 1/1 mice, z80% of the GP33-specific T cells re-
mained unresponsive for an extended period. Thus, the
duration of exposure to viral antigen is a critical parameter
that influences T cell responsiveness. Clone 13 causes the
most prolonged infection and results in a pronounced
“functional deficit” within the GP33-specific CD8 T cell
population. Unlike LCMV-t1b infection, even after clone
13 infection has been controlled the GP33-specific T cells
do not rapidly regain their capacity to elicit antiviral effec-
tor functions. None of the LCMV strains used in this study
infect CD8 T cells; therefore, the unresponsiveness of
GP33-specific cells is not due to a direct effect of LCMV
replication within these cells. However, LCMV does repli-
cate within professional APCs and the presentation of viral
antigen by these cells can target them for destruction by vi-
rus-specific CTL (52, 53). Loss of professional APCs is least
apparent during Armstrong infection and most widespread
during clone 13 infection. Consequently, during systemic
LCMV infection professional APCs are destroyed and large
numbers of “nonprofessional” APCs may present viral anti-
gen. Such conditions are likely to favor the induction of
CD8 T cell unresponsiveness. Moreover, professional APCs
may be aberrantly activated in the absence of CD4 T cell
help and this may further promote the functional un-
responsiveness of CD8 T cells (54–57). Thus, a chronic an-
tigenic stimulus in the absence of adequate CD4 help
appears to be the worst possible scenario resulting in com-
plete loss of CD8 effector functions and uncontrolled virus
infection. Although such regulatory mechanisms are not
well suited to deal with chronic infections and tumors, they
may have evolved to prevent autoimmunity.
The degree of T cell activation is likely to be an impor-
tant parameter that determines whether CD8 T cells are
deleted or become functionally unresponsive (48). The ex-
tent of T cell activation can be influenced by the abun-
dance of antigen that is presented and also by the affinity of
the TCR for the given MHC–peptide complex. Virus-
infected cells will display both GP33 and NP396 epitopes
to responding T cells. One possibility is that different
amounts of GP33 and NP396 epitopes are presented in the
periphery of chronically infected adult mice (58, 59). Con-
sequently, GP33- and NP396-specific T cells may not be
similarly activated and therefore the fate of these T cells
could be differentially regulated. Alternatively, the on and
off rates of GP33- and NP396-specific TCRs may differ. In
this case even if both epitopes are present in similar con-
centrations on the infected cells, the responding T cells
may undergo different activation programs and conse-
quently succumb to different fates (i.e., deletion versus
nonresponsiveness). Interestingly, GP33-specific T cells are
not intrinsically resistant to deletion, and both GP33- and
NP396-specific T cells are undetectable by tetramer stain-
ing in congenitally infected LCMV carrier mice (data not
shown). These results suggest that GP33-specific CD8 T
cells can undergo deletion during central (thymic) toler-
ance.
Our findings are clearly relevant for understanding how
virus-specific CD8 T cell responses determine the outcome
of persistent viral infections. We have shown that virus-

The in vivo proliferation of GP33-specific CD8 T cells in LCMV-t1b in-
fected 1/1 and CD42/2 mice (day 100 after infection) was assessed by in
vivo BrdU labeling. Mice were fed BrdU in their drinking water for a to-

specific T cells that express activation markers, such as
CD44 and CD69, can be maintained in an unresponsive
state during chronic infections. Therefore, simply detecting
the physical presence of activated virus-specific CD8 T
cells, which turn over in vivo, does not necessarily mean
that these cells are operating to control the infection (60).
However, our data also demonstrate that not all virus-spe-
cific T cells need to be functionally competent in order to
resolve a chronic infection. For example, even though
NP396-specific T cells are deleted and only 10–20% of
GP33-specific T cells are functional, infection with LCMV
clone 13 is eventually resolved in 1/1 mice. This suggests
that for the control of persistent viral infections a threshold
of functional antiviral T cells needs to be maintained. The
number of functional antiviral CD8 T cells could fall below
this threshold if too many virus-specific CD8 T cells are ei-
ther deleted or become unresponsive, as occurs in the ab-
sence of CD4 T cell help. Such dampening of virus-specific
CD8 T cell responses would result in a more protracted or
even an uncontrollable infection.
The most striking finding of this study is that “activated”
but effector-function–negative virus-specific CD8 T cells
can persist indefinitely in chronically infected mice at re-
markably high frequencies (1–2% of total CD8 T cells). It is
likely that such effector-function–negative virus-specific
CD8 T cells will also be found in chronic viral infections of
humans. During HIV infection, CD8 CTLs play an impor-
tant role in controlling the viral burden and both deletion
and functional unresponsiveness may impair the efficacy of
these responses (16). Moreover, as progression to AIDS oc-
curs, the numbers of CD4 T cells decline, and Rosenburg
et al. (21) reported that weak HIV-specific CD4 T cell re-
sponses correlate with higher viral loads. This is consistent
with our data showing that CD4 T cells are required to
maintain the effector functions of virus-specific CD8 T
cells, and also suggests that if the number of functional vi-
rus-specific CD8 T cells falls below a threshold level, then
an uncontrollable chronic infection can ensue. Since CD8
T cells are potent mediators of viral clearance, it is impor-
tant to elucidate how to restore and sustain the effector
functions of virus-specific T cells. Antiviral therapies that
are designed to turn on the effector activity of preexisting
virus-specific CD8 T cells may be successful at both clear-
ing persistent infections and enhancing protective immu-
nity to reinfection.

Summary The effect of additional treatrnents after surgery in patients with primary cardiac sarcoma (PCS) remains unknown. The present
study aims to evaluate the benefit of chemotherapy in patients with non-metastatic cardiac sarcomas after optimal resection. Between
October 1979 and December 1995, 15 patients with a median age of 45 (range 16-66) and a resected primary cardiac sarcoma
[angk)sarcoma (six), mnalignant fibrous histiocytoma (three), leiomyosarcoma (two), rhabdomyosarcoma (two), liposarcoma (one) and
synoviosarcoma (one)] received a doxorubicin-containing regimen within 6 weeks of surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy combinations included
cycophosphamide, vincristine and dacarbazine in four patients; ifosfamide in nine; methotrexate and vincristine in one; and doxorubicn alone
in one patient. At present, 13 patients have relapsed (five during therapy), with a median time to progression of 10 months. Twelve patients
developed local relapse, in four cases withut metastatic disease. Two patients remain in complete remission 27 and 25 months after surgery.
The median time to progression was shorter in patients presenting a cardiac angiosarcoma than other histological types (3 vs 14 months,
P < 0.01). Twelve patients have died, with a median overall survival of 12 months. The 2-year survival rate is 26%. Survival was significantly
klnger for patients with completely resected tumours (22 vs 7 months; P = 0.02) and those who did not have angiosarcom (18 vs 7 months;
P = 0.04). In conclusion, post-operative conventional doxorubecin-based chemotherapy failed to modify the natural history of patients with
resected cardiac sarcomras. Locoregional failure remains the main problem even after histologically complete resecton. New approaches
must be tested in patients with primary cardiac sarcomna.

Primary cardiac sarcomas are extremely rare. They account for 8%
of all pnrmary cardiac tumours resected (Blondeau. 1990). but
the necroscopic incidence
is threefold that of operated cases
(Chomette et al, 1985). All histological types have been described.
and angiosarcoma. representing 30-45% of cases. is the most
commonly described (McAllister et al. 1979: Silverman, 1980).
During the course of the disease, the presenting symptoms
(dyspnoea, chest pain, congestive heart failure, palpitations, fever.
or myalgia) appear late, and these delayed manifestations gener-
ally reflect a wide local extension with severe cardiac damage
(Goodwin.
1968). Even though
distant
metastasis
frequently
occurs,
the
clinical
course
in patients with primary cardiac
sarcoma is related to local tumour extension (Becker et al. 1985).
Since the first surgical resection of a cardiac tumour was
reported (Crafoord, 1955). surgery has become the standard first-
line treatment, able to provide substantial palliation of symptoms
and prolong survival (Dein et al, 1987). However, most patients
present with marginally resectable or technically non-resectable
disease at diagnosis, and patients surviving 2 years after local exci-
sion are rarely reported (Murphy et al. 1990: Moggio et al. 1992).
Given the likely inadequacy of surgical margins and the high risk
of distant metastasis, both adjuvant radiotherapy and systemic
chemotherapy have been recommended. Unfortunately. the results

of these multimodality therapies are disappointing. In two recent
retrospective series (Putman et al. 1991: Burke et al. 1992). surgical
resection was the only factor found to improve survival, with a
suggested enhancement conferred by post-operative chemotherapy.
This study analyses the patterns of relapse and survival of 15
patients who have undergone resection of a primary cardiac
sarcoma. together with an adjuvant anthracycline-based chemo-
therapy regimen at the same institution.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
From October 1978 to December 1995. 19 patients were admitted
to our institution with an initial diagnosis of primary malignant
cardiac sarcoma. Patients were referred for additional treatment by
French or Italian cardiovascular or thoracic institutions.
Histological diagnosis was made on the operative specimens
and all slides were reviewed by the pathology department of the
Institut Gustave Roussy. France. Diagnostic criteria excluded
patients with a history of soft-tissue or bone sarcoma. Surgery with
any macroscopic or microscopic involvement of margins was
classified as incomplete. Complete resection was defined by the
absence of involvement of all margins. The medical record of each
patient was reviewed and routine demographic data recorded until
1 March 1998. Lost follow-up information on two patients was
obtained by corresponding with their physicians.
Survival
was
calculated
using
the
Kaplan-Meier
method
(Kaplan and Meier, 1958). Groups were compared using the gener-
alized Wilcoxon-Gehan test (Gehan et al.
1965). All P-values
resulted from two-sided tests. Time to progression was calculated
from the date of surgical resection to the date of first relapse. Time

to local failure was determined from the date of resection to the
date of local relapse. Survival was calculated from the date of the
first operation to the date of last follow-up information.
RESULTS
Four patients with primary cardiac sarcoma (PCS) have been
excluded from the analysis. Two of these had an unresectable
tumour. suitable for biopsy only; death occurred 2 and 6 months
after diagnosis. The other two patients presented with synchronous
lung or cutaneous metastases. Local resection was complete in one.
but incomplete in the other. Neither patient responded to an anthra-
cycline-based chemotherapy regimen: in both cases the cause of
death was local progression 5 and 12 mWonths after surgery.
The characteristics of the remaining 11 male and four female
patients are listed in Table 1. The median age was 45 years (range
16-66). Six patients (40%) had an angiosarcoma. three a malig-
nant fibrous histiocytoma. two a leiomyosarcoma. two a rhabdo-
myosarcoma. and the remaining two had a liposarcoma and a
synovialsarcoma- The chamber of origin was associated with the
histological subtype: angiosarcoma commonly originated in the
right side of the heart (right atrium. n = 4; left atrium. n = 1; right
atrium and ventricle. n = 1). All the other histological types but
one developed on the left side of the heart (left atrium. n = 7: left
atrium and ventricle. n =
1: right atrium. n =
1). All patients
presented symptoms at diagnosis; cardiac manifestations varied
from chest pain to cardiac heart failure or constrictive pericarditis.
One patient developed a tumour embolus as the first symptom. A
patient with an implanted metallic mitral valve (patient 11) devel-
oped a malignant fibrous histiocytoma adjacent to this valve.
A complete resection was achieved in six patients. but was
incomplete in nine (four with microscopical residual disease and
five with gross residual tumour). Five out of six patients with an
angiosarcoma and four out of nine with other histological types
had incomplete resections.
After initial debulking surgery, all patients had a performance
status (PS) of 0-1 (PS 0. eight patients: PS
1. seven patients)
without severe congestive heart failure or obstructive symptoms.
documented by a normnal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
Three out of four patients with gross residual tumour. along with
seven other patients, underwent a chest scan or a cardiac magnetic
resonance
examination
before
chemotherapy.
Adjuvant
chemotherapy started within 6 weeks of surgery and included
(Table 1): cyclophosphamide. doxorubicin. vincristine and dacar-
bazine (CYVADIC regimen. n = 4): ifosfamide and doxorubicin
(Al regimen. n = 9): doxorubicin. methotrexate and vincristine
(AMV regimen. n = 1): and doxorubicine alone (n = 1). The mean
number of chemotherapy courses for the whole group was four
(range 1-6). Chemotherapy was stopped in one patient after three
cycles (cumulative doxorubicin dose 225 mg mr-) because of
impairment of LVEF. In five patients in whom resection was
incomplete. a local and/or distant recurrence was observed during
adjuvant chemotherapy. The nine patients who completed the
planned chemotherapy received a median doxorubicin cumulative
dose of 300 mg m-2 (range 250-360 mg m-2). Additional medi-
astinal adjuvant radiotherapy (50 Gy) was delivered to one patient
in whom surgical resection was incomplete.
Twelve patients (80%) developed local recurrence. which was
the first tumour event in eight of them. but in four was synchro-
nous with metastatic progression. The median disease-free interval
for local relapse was 11 months (range 1-25). Distant metastases
were observed in nine patients after a median time of 7 months
(range 1-65). The metastatic sites involved were the lung (n = 7).
soft tissue (n = 3). bone (n = 2). liver (n = 1). abdomen (n = 1) and
the central nervous system (n = 1). Only two patients were free of
disease at the time of analysis. with a follow-up of 25 and 27
months. The median disease-free progression interval (DFI) was
10 months (range 1-25).
Patients with primary cardiac angiosarcoma had a significantly
shorter DFI than patients with other histological types (P < 0.05):
the median DFI was 4 months (range 1-12) and 13 months (range
4-25) for vascular and non-vascular sarcoma respectively.
At the first sign of relapse. different palliative procedures were
implemented. Further chemotherapy regimens were administered

Overall surviva
by histoogical type
in five patients with measurable lesions (five second-line and two
third-line regimens). One minor response (of less than 3 months)
and six cases of progressive disease were observed- No improve-
ment of symptoms was obtained with mediastinal radiotherapy in
four patients who had local progression. Two patients underwent
further surgery. One patient died during a heart transplant because
of local relapse. Finally, one patient with a primary cardiac rhab-
domyosarcoma obtained two remissions with local resections 24
and 43 months after the first surgical procedure; he developed a
metastatic recurrence 65 months later. which was also completely
resected. This young patient developed symptomatic congestive
heart failure (LVEF = 37%) after three cardiac resections and
450 mg m-2 of doxorubicin cumulative doses.
At the time of the analysis, 12 patients (80%) have died. The
cause of death was related to locoregional progression in 11. One
patient, who had no local recurrence, died of pulmonary metas-
tases 5 months after surgery. The median overall survival was 12
months (range 2-68). and the 2-year overall survival rate was 19%
(Figure 1).
Survival was significandly shorter in patients with angiosarcoma
than in the rest of the population (7 vs 18 months. P = 0.04) as
shown in Figure 2. The six patients with a completely resected
cardiac sarcoma had a significandly longer survival rate than the
nine with residual disease (Figure 3), with a median survival of 22
months and 7 months respectively (P = 0.02).
DISCUSSION
Primary sarcoma of the heart is rare with a dismal short-term prog-
nosis. Surgery is the only treatment capable of improving outcome
even after palliative resection, but long-term survivors are still
anecdotal. Sporadic cases of long-term survivors treated with radi-
ation therapy (Stevens et al. 1992) and/or chemotherapy (Potter et
al. 1989) have been reported. However, because of the small
number of patients. we do not know whether post-surgical treat-
ment can confer a gain in survival.
For common
soft-tissue
sarcomas.
adjuvant anthracycline-
containing chemotherapy regimens seem to decrease the incidence
of local and metastatic relapse (Tiemey et al, 1995). Inadequate

vant chemotherapy. Mainly for these reasons, most authors have
recommended complementary chemotherapy
with
or without
radiotherapy in patients with resected PCS (Demny. 1996).
The goal of this retrospective study was to analyse the potential
benefit of post-operative doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy in
healthy patients with PCS having undergone local resection.
Patients with unresectable tumours. low performance status or any
contraindication to anthracyclines were excluded. Doxorubicin
was used in most cases combined with ifosfamide or dacarbazine.

et al, 1993; Edmonson et al. 1993; Santoro et al. 1995). Chemo-
therapy was started within 6 weeks of surgery. Thus, this series
represents a selected group of PCS patients treated by surgery and
optimal chemotherapy.
with a hypothetically more favourable
outcome than in any other published study. Despite this. results are
disappointing.
The median interval
to
first relapse (local
or
metastatic) was 10 months and the median survival was
12
months. Only three patients were alive at the time of analysis. one
with

disease.
These
results
move
towards
those
obtained by another series (Putman et al, 1989) who achieved an
overall survival rate of 14% at 2 years in a less favourable popula-
tion, including patients with non-resected or untreated disease.
The type of sarcoma was the only histological finding corre-
lating with progression-free survival and overall survival. Patients
with cardiac angiosarcoma had the least favourable outcome
because all relapsed and died. 83% of them in the first year. None
of the published series stressed this point, but Putman et al (1989)
reported no surviving patients with angiosarcoma 18 months after
diagnosis as opposed to 42% (5 out of 12 patients) with other
histological types. In common sarcomas (visceral or soft tissue),
angiosarcomas have a poor prognosis irrespective of primary site
and histological grade. A retrospective analysis on 1100 patients
with resected sarcoma (Hashimoto et al. 1992) reported an overall
survival of 14% at 5 years for angiosarcoma. as opposed to 70%
for patients with myxoid liposarcoma. In PCS. a previous study
(Burke et al. 1991) demonstrated a relationship between histolog-
ical features, for example high mitotic activity or tumour necrosis
and dismal outcome.

Chemotherapy in primary cardiac sarcomas
1627
The quality of initial tumour debulking was predictive of a
disease-free and status survival in our study. One series (Putnam et
al. 1991) reported an overall survival of 24 months for patients
having undergone wide resection of tumours. compared with only
10 months in all other patients. Similarly. in the univariate analysis.
complete or wide excision was associated with an increased
survival in the Anned Forces Institute series (Burke et al. 1992)
The extent of the surgical procedure seemed related to histo-
logical type because angiosarcoma patients had more incomplete
resections (five out of six). whereas patients with non-vascular
sarcomas had more completely resected tumour (five out of nine).
This point did not reach statistical significance probably because
of the small number of patients (P = 0.1). However. the relatively
high incidence of pericardic involvement and multifocal presenta-
tion of angiosarcomas could partially account for the inadequate
local control of these tumours.
Local relapse was the first and most common type of recur-
rence. Only one patient. who died early because of pulmonary
metastases. had no local failure. However. distant metastases were
generally detected at the same time or a few months after local
recurrence. The same pattern of relapse is observed in patients
with marginally or incompletely resected high-grade soft-tissue
sarcomas (Choong et al. 1995: Lewis et al. 1997).
Primary cardiac sarcomas can be divided into two groups
according to the histological subtype. Cardiac angiosarcomas tend
to anse in the right chambers of the heart. thus delaying symptoms
(Janigan et al. 1986). They are initially larger tumours and carry a
poor prognosis whatever the quality of initial surgical resection.
which is generally incomplete (Potter et al. 1989). These factors.
compounded by the high frequency of distant metastasis at diag-
nosis (Herrmann et al. 1992). contribute to the limited duration of
survival. Moreover. these tumours are usually resistant to conven-
tional cytotoxic agents as observed in our patients. New effective
drugs. and innovative strategies such as inmunotherapy. antiangio-
genic factors or intensive chemotherapy regimens need to be
tested on these high-grade aggressive tumours.
In contrast. non-vascular cardiac sarcomas appear to be less
aggressive: they arise predominantly in the left chambers of the
heart and present as an intracavity mass. The most frequent cause
of relapse in our series was local progression. These tumours
should undergo optimal resection. and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
could be incorporated in treatment. Adjuvant radiotherapy seems
mandatory if the aim is to preclude local relapse. but the best option
for selected patients could be an orthotopic cardiac transplant.
In recent years. orthotopic heart transplant has been proposed to
only a few unselected patients with primary cardiac sarcoma
(Goldstein et al. 1995). namely patients with locally advanced
tumours (Siebenmann et al. 1990) or angiosarcoma (Armitage et al.
1990: Crespo et al. 1993). Most of these cases rapidly developed
distant metastases thereafter. and long-term survivors are still rare
(Aravot et al. 1989). Based on our data. heart transplantation can be
proposed
to patients
with widely
resected non-angiosarcoma
cardiac tumours with no obvious distant metastasis.
In conclusion and despite the dismal prognosis. a benefit in quality
of life and sur ival has been observed over the last decade in patients
with PCS. This improvement is based on (i) the routine use of
echocardiography. allowing a more accurate diagnosis: (ii) the devel-
opment of new surgical techniques which have improved the quality
and number of cardiac resections (Perchinsky et al. 1997): and.
perhaps. (iii) the optimization of chemotherapy regimens including
anthracyclins and high-dose ifosfamide (Le Cesne et al. 1996).
In the next years. oncologists will be concerned about additional
treatments in patients after optimal PCS resection. The impact of
conventional chemotherapy cannot be determined in this small and
retrospective study. but a need for more active systemic treatments
and/or new therapeutic approaches emerged from the outcome of
these patients.

Abscess Formation Following Spilled Gallstones
During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy
Mary T. Brueggemeyer, MD, Alexander K. Saba, MD, Louis C. Thibodeaux, MD
ABSTRACT
Objective: Our purpose was to report the occurrence of
abscess following spilled gallstones during laparoscopic
cholecystectomy as experienced at Good Samaritan
Hospital, and to compare it to the experience of other insti-
tutions in order to identify the incidence, characteristics and
possible risk factors for the development of this complica-
tion.
Methods: Four case reports of abscess following spilled
gallstones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy are pre-
sented. The English literature was reviewed, and charac-
teristics of the case reports found in the literature were
compared.
Results: In four years at this institution, four reports of
abscess formation following laparoscopic cholecystectomy
have been identified. Two occurred in elderly females and
were located in the right flank in both. Two were in mid-
dle-aged men, both diabetic. One abscess was in the right
flank and one in the right pleural space. Twenty-three
cases were found in the literature. The average age was 65
years; there were 12 men and 11 women. The locations of
abscess formation were trocar sites (most common), right
subphrenic space, right flank or retroperitoneum, and
pelvis. The average time to presentation was 4-5 months
(range 4 days - 12 months).
Conclusions: Abscess formation following spilled gall-
stones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy occurs infre-
quently, but can be debilitating and require more than one
procedure. The older population appears to be at greater
risk. Future prospective studies of patients who undergo
laparoscopic cholecystectomy are needed to more accu-
rately determine the incidence of this complication and to
identify the population at risk.

INTRODUCTION
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard of care for the
surgical treatment of gallbladder disease. Since its intro-
duction in 1987 by Dubois et al.,1 the surgical community
has sought to determine the full spectrum of complications
associated with this technique. Several published series of
laparoscopic cholecystectomies have found an overall mor-
bidity of about 5%.2-4 The most common complications
were retained common bile duct stones, bile leak, superfi-
cial wound infection, and, the most serious, bile duct injury.
One complication that may be occurring more often with
the laparoscopic technique is gallbladder perforation and
spillage of stones into the peritoneal cavity. How often this
event leads to adverse sequela remains unanswered. In the
following article, four cases of adverse sequela from spilled
gallstones are presented with an extensive review of the lit-
erature in order to evaluate the incidence, etiology, possible
risk factors, and treatment of spilled gallstones and intra-
abdominal abscess.
CASE 1
Six weeks following coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG), a 58-year-old white male with uncontrolled dia-
betes developed right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomit-
ing and elevated liver function tests. He underwent laparo-
scopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. There was
spillage of stones and bile during the case and only some
of the stones were retrieved. 
His initial postoperative
course was uneventful. He presented three months later,
febrile, complaining of right upper quadrant and right flank
pain. 
Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen
revealed a large subhepatic and retroperitoneal fluid collec-
tion which was percutaneously drained (Figure 1). The
culture grew Klebsiella. He was treated with intravenous
piperacillin and then switched to oral ciprofloxacin for a ten
day course. His symptoms were relieved only to recur two
months later. 
The CT scan showed recurrence of the
abscess (Figure 2). He was taken to the operating room
for a posterior exploration that revealed retained gallstones
at the base of the abscess. These were removed and the
wound debrided and irrigated. The culture again grew
Klebsiella sensitive to ciprofloxacin. He was discharged
with another course of ciprofloxacin and wound care. He
returned again five months later to have further debride-
ment. He has since required another exploration in the
operating room and is currently recovering.

CASE 2
A 53-year-old white male, status post CABG, underwent
elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for chronic chole-
cystitis during which there was spillage of bile and stones
into the peritoneal cavity. He received a preoperative dose
of 
cefotetan 
and 
was 
discharged 
home 
on
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. He returned six days later with
fever and leukocytosis. A CT of the abdomen revealed a
right pleural effusion and a fluid collection in the gallblad-
der fossa (Figure 3). 
The fluid was percutaneously
drained, and the culture grew Enterococcus sensitive to
ampicillin. He was treated with intravenous cefotetan and
metronidazole and discharged on amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid with resolution of his symptoms.
CASE 3
An 85-year-old white female presented to the emergency
department complaining of a painful indurated area over
her right flank. The patient reportedly fell at home three
days prior to presentation and hit her right side on a chair.
She did not admit to any other injuries. She also denied
recent febrile illness. She did report occasional pain over
her right side but attributed this to her osteoarthritis.
Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a white blood cell
count of 15,000 with a left shift.
She had a history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1991
and reported persistent pain in her right upper quadrant
since her surgery. A right upper quadrant ultrasound
revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory studies were also
negative. She denied history of jaundice, dark urine or
acholic stools.
The area over the right flank was clinically felt to represent
an abscess of unknown etiology and was opened in the
emergency department under local anesthesia. 
A large
amount of pus was released and the wound was packed
open. A CT scan was ordered to rule out a perforated vis-
cus or a renal tumor. The next morning numerous small
gallstones were noted to be on the packing as it was
removed. 
The CT scan showed a large abscess cavity
involving the right retroperitoneum (Figure 4). 
The
patient was taken to the operating room where the cavity
was widely opened and drained. 
Additional gallstones
were recovered. The patient recovered without any addi-
tional problems and the wound is now healed.
CASE 4
A 91-year-old white female nursing home resident was
found to have a chronically draining sinus tract located on
her right side just above the posterior superior iliac spine.

She had previously undergone drainage of a subcutaneous
abscess in this location. This condition had been managed
with repeated local debridements and dressing changes for
a period of two years. A sinogram was obtained in an effort
to elucidate the etiology of the problem, but it was not help-
ful.
The patient underwent a formal debridement of the area in
an effort to eliminate the source of chronic infection. As the
tract was explored, a large (2 x 2 cm) gallstone was
retrieved from the tract with several smaller stones. The
wound was packed open and had healed after two weeks.
The patient had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy
30 months prior to her presentation to our service.
DISCUSSION
The complication of gallbladder perforation and spilled
gallstones has been reviewed by several authors2,3,5-7 (Table
1). The incidence of perforation ranged from 9% to 40%;
Figure 4. Retroperitoneal abscess several years after laparo-
scopic cholecystectomy. Bright area in center of abscess
represents ""spilled"" gallstones that were removed during
abscess drainage.
stones were retained 1% to 13% of the time. Soper et al.6
conducted a prospective study specifically designed to
identify the rate of spilled stones. They reported a rate of
32%, with a 5% incidence of acute gallbladders.
The incidence of gallbladder perforation is believed to
exceed that of the traditional open method, although not
officially reported in the literature. During laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, there are three maneuvers that can result
in gallbladder perforation. First, the gallbladder is used for
traction to assist in the dissection of the cystic duct and cys-
tic artery. This exposes the gallbladder to excessive trac-
tion forces and graspers that may tear the wall of the gall-
bladder. Secondly, the gallbladder may be entered during
dissection from the liver bed. Finally, the gallbladder is
extracted from the abdomen through a small incision, at
which time it may be put under high pressures. Perforation
is easily avoided if extension of the skin incision is per-
formed when needed. The amount of inflammation pre-
sent may also contribute to the rate of perforation.

Inflammation could cause the gallbladder wall to be friable
and more prone to tearing under the stress of traction. It
may also cause it to be more difficult to define the plane
between the liver and the gallbladder during dissection.
Huang and colleagues5 found that 12 of 20 gallbladders
perforated were acutely inflamed.
Despite the high rate of perforation and associated stone
spillage, it is not entirely clear what the full implications of
this event are. In the one prospective analysis of this prob-
lem, Soper et al.6 found only an increase in operative time
when perforation and spillage occurred. 
This time was
spent retrieving stones and irrigating the abdomen. None
of the 250 patients developed an intra-abdominal abscess
over a 3-16 month follow-up. Nonetheless, abscess forma-
tion or chronically draining sinus tracts due to retained
stones has been documented. 
In Donohue's3 series, a
patient required laparotomy with drainage of the abscess
and removal of the retained stones. A patient in Huang's5
series developed a chronically draining sinus tract at the
subcostal trocar site. 
The authors of this review have
encountered four cases of intra-abdominal abscess due to
spilled stones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Three
of the laparoscopic cholecystectomies were done at Good
Samaritan Hospital where 1,726 laparoscopic cholecystec-
tomies have been performed since 1993. The fourth case
was performed at a smaller affiliate hospital. Two of these
four presented back at Good Samaritan Hospital where the

diagnosis of abscess secondary to spilled stones was made.
The other two patients were evaluated at other hospitals.
Although it has not been prospectively evaluated, it is the
authors' experience that stones are spilled frequently. How
the stones are dealt with appears to be surgeon-specific,
depending on the perceived severity of the spillage.
Finally, there are 23 case reports in the English literature
dating back to 1992 that describe intra-abdominal abscess
secondary to retained gallstones1,5,12-29 (Table 3). The
mean age of the patients was 65 years (range 31-90 years).
The gender distribution was 12 males and 11 females. The
average time to presentation was 4-5 months (range 4 days
- 12 months). The abscess or sinus tract was located by CT
or ultrasound. The sites of involvement were all trocar sites
(7), subphrenic (5), right flank or retroperitoneum (3), sub-
hepatic (4), omentum (3), pulmonary (2), pelvis/ovary (4).
Some cases had more than one location. 
Four cases
required more than one procedure. The bacteria involved
(when described) were Escherichia coli (6), Klebsiella (4),
Enterobacter (1), Enterococcus (1), Lactobacillus (1), and
Serratia (1). The gallbladder was acutely inflamed in five
cases. 
Of these, 2 were empyema and one was gan-
grenous. The type of stone extracted, when reported, was
bilirubinate in four and cholesterol in one.
Despite the high rate of spillage reported in the literature,
the incidence of abscess appears to be low (Table 2). Our

experience at Good Samaritan Hospital is similar to these
reports: four cases of abscess out of 1,726 laparoscopic
cholecystectomies done in four years. This causes one to
wonder what it is about those patients who develop
abscesses that puts them at risk. After reviewing the 23
case reports in the literature, a few observations were
made. The mean age of the patients, 65 years, exceeded
the mean age of patients undergoing laparoscopic chole-
cystectomy by more than ten years.3-6,8,9 Two of the
patients described in the literature, and two of our patients
were documented as being diabetic; also, two patients had
a recent history of CABG suggesting that the patient's med-
ical condition may increase the risk for abscess formation.
The type and amount of biliary disease may also put the
patient at risk. As previously mentioned, patients with
acute cholecystitis may be more likely to experience
spillage of bile and stones. Even in the absence of clini-
cally acute inflammation, up to 30% of bile cultures are pos-
itive for bacteria.30 Whether the bile is infected or not may
not be as important to abscess formation as the stone itself.
In an animal study, Johnston, et al.30 found that rats under-
going laparotomy with placement of a stone and bile
intraperitoneally developed adhesions around the stone.
Two rats developed abscess at the stone site. Surprisingly,
the bile was sterile in the group that developed abscess. It
is possible that the stone itself harbored active bacteria. A
study by Stewart et al.31 examined 32 pigment stones and
35 cholesterol stones. Seventy-eight percent of the pigment
stones had evidence of bacterial microcolonies whereas
none of the cholesterol stones showed evidence of bacte-
ria. Only five of the 23 cases reported in the literature doc-
ument the type of stone spilled. Of these, four were found
to be bilirubinate. This spillage of black pigment stones
may be more likely to precipitate an abscess.
Prevention of abscess by prevention of spillage is the best
policy. Gentle traction and careful dissection should be
maintained in all cases. If perforation does occur, the spill
should be contained by placing an endo-loop or clips over
the area or placing the grasper in such a way as to close
the perforation. This may prevent stones from falling out
during the rest of the dissection. Removal of the gallblad-
der from the epigastric or umbilical incision should be visu-
alized with the scope to identify spillage if it occurs. If the
stone or stones are too large, the fascial incision can be eas-
ily extended. The gallbladder can be suction evacuated to
reduce its size, and the stones removed with a ring forceps.
Finally, the gallbladder can be placed in a sterile bag for
removal.
When stones are spilled, as many as possible should be
retrieved, even if operative time is increased. 
Several
devices exist to facilitate this process. 
One may use a
spoon, disposable bag or sleeve, or the large 20-mm shut-
tle collector. There are some who recommend immediate
laparotomy for spilled stone removal. Most authors dis-
agree with this approach, believing that time is better spent
preventing perforation, containing the spill, and retrieving
stones laparoscopically, since most patients will not devel-
op a major complication from this event. The role of peri-
operative antibiotics in prevention of postoperative abscess
has not been defined, but probably has little effect.
When intra-abdominal abscess does occur most patients
present within five months, but some may take longer than
one year. The diagnosis should be suspected if the patient
has a history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The opera-
tive record should be reviewed for report of stone spillage
during the procedure, although this may not be accurate.
The authors of this review now consistently document
whether stones were spilled and if the stones were
retrieved, but this is most likely an exception to the usual
dictated reports. The operative reports of the four cases in
this study did not describe perforation or spillage of stones.
Also, the pathology report may be helpful if no stones were
found with the specimen, especially if stones were docu-
mented by preoperative ultrasound. This was the case in
the fourth patient.
The typical symptoms are pain and fever. A chronic sinus
tract may also be present. The diagnosis is made by CT or
ultrasound, and first attempts at cure are made using these
modalities for percutaneous drainage. Additional proce-
dures may be required, and some patients may require
laparotomy for complete drainage and removal of stones.
Antibiotic coverage should be based on culture results and
coverage of the more common biliary organisms.
CONCLUSION
During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, perforation of the
gallbladder with spillage of stones is common, but the
development of intra-abdominal abscess is not. Because of
the low incidence of intra abdominal abscess, immediate
laparotomy is not indicated, but attempts should be made
to remove all the stones laparoscopically. Meticulous sur-
gical technique is the best preventative measure. When
intra-abdominal abscesses do occur, they can be very debil-
itating and require more than one procedure to achieve res-
olution of the abscess.
After reviewing the available data in the literature, there
may be a patient population at higher risk for developing
long-term complications from retained gallstones. Older,
debilitated patients with underlying medical conditions
(i.e., IDDM) may be at greater risk. A prospective analysis
of all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is
needed to accurately determine the incidence of these
long-term complications and the specific population at risk.

The Cystic Vein: The Significance
of a Forgotten Anatomic Landmark
Arthur Fine, MD
ABSTRACT
The cystic vein, a portion of biliary anatomy whose insignif-
icance in open gallbladder surgery led to its being relegat-
ed to mythology, has been rediscovered by the magnified
view of laparoscopic surgery. Its presence is an important
anatomic feature that helps 
distinguish between cystic
duct and common hepatic duct, thus diminishing the risk
of inadvertent bile duct injury during laparoscopic chole-
cystectomy.
Key Words: Cystic vein, Laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
Bile duct injury.

INTRODUCTION
First performed in 1989, laparoscopic cholecystectomy
quickly became the gold standard for surgical extirpation of
the gallbladder. Soon after, reports began to emerge of an
increased incidence of significant bile duct injuries.1
Reported injury rates varied from 0.1% to 2.2% compared
with 0.1% for open cholecystectomy.2,3 The increased rate
of bile duct injury has been attributed to a steep learning
curve for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.4 Subsequent refer-
ral to tertiary centers for repair of transected common bile
ducts resulted in published series that outlined the mecha-
nisms of injury.1,5,6
Risk factors for iatrogenic injury to the common duct appear
to be the surgeon's inexperience, patient obesity, scarring
and acute inflammation.4 A common factor in the reported
cases of bile duct injury is the misidentification of common
duct for cystic duct, resulting in resection of a portion of the
common bile and hepatic ducts and a right hepatic artery
injury.5 Precautions suggested to decrease the possibility of
bile duct injury have included: routine cystic duct cholan-
giography, cholecystocholangiography, confirmed identifi-
cation of the junction of the cystic duct with the common
bile and hepatic ducts and identification of the junction of
the cystic artery with the right hepatic artery.
Our experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy sup-
ports the importance of anatomic identification in the safe
performance of the procedure and also suggests the pres-
ence of a useful and reproducible anatomic landmark which
can help define a zone of safe dissection within the triangle
of Calot.
METHODS
This study is derived from a single surgeon's experience
with more than 300 laparoscopic cholecystectomies per-
formed since 1991. All patients with acute or chronic gall-

approach with the exception of those with suspected gall-

The anatomy of the biliary tree was defined prior to division
of the cystic duct and artery. An operative cholangiogram
was attempted in all patients. Cholangiograms were aban-
doned only if the lumen of the cystic duct would not
accommodate the epidural catheter used for this purpose.
During 1996, patients were chosen in one of three repre-
sentative categories as they randomly presented in the

course of our practice. These were chronic disease, acute-
ly inflamed gallbladder and intra-operatively identified
aberrant anatomy. These were used as descriptive case
studies.
RESULTS
Case I:
I.M., a 67 year-old-female with biliary colic systems and
ultrasound proven cholecystolithiasis, underwent outpa-
tient laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two 1 mm veins were
demonstrated within the triangle of Calot between the cys-
tic duct and cystic artery (Figure 1). They were divided
with the Harmonic Scalpel (Ultracision).
Case II:
M.B., a 56-year-old female with biliary colic symptoms and
cholecystolithiasis on ultrasound, underwent outpatient
Figure 2. Case II: Cystic veins confluence with portal triad
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An arterial structure within
the triangle of Calot was identified. A small venous struc-
ture was found to be crossing it and extending to the gall-
bladder (Figure 2). Further dissection showed the artery
to be an aberrant right hepatic artery with a short cystic
artery identified later. The latter was ligated and divided
uneventfully.
Case II:
N.M., a 49-year-old female, was admitted with acute
abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis and thickened gall-
bladder containing stones on ultrasound. The gallbladder
was found to be inflamed and edematous at time of
surgery. Dissection within the triangle of Calot demon-
strated venous structures between the later confirmed cys-
tic duct and artery (Figure 3). Cholecystectomy proceed-
ed uneventfully.
Early in our experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
the presence of small tubular structures within the triangle
of Calot became evident as being necessarily divided to
proceed with the dissection. Among these was a structure
that presented as a bridge between the cystic artery and
duct; the division of which, unless controlled, resulted in
insignificant but annoying bleeding. It quickly became a
standard part of the procedure to clip or cauterize this ves-

sel during the dissection. Its color and non-pulsatile bleed-
ing when divided, indicated that this was a vein, ostensibly
unnamed. Further experience established the presence of
other veins consistently present within the triangle. It was
subsequently determined that these venous channels were
named as the cystic veins and their courses documented in
early textbooks of anatomy.
CONCLUSIONS
A consistent anatomic feature during laparoscopic cholecys-
tectomy has been the presence of venous twigs that run par-
allel to the cystic duct and perpendicular to the common bile
duct, bridging the gap between cystic artery and cystic duct.
As the veins do not cross the common hepatic duct, their
presence can serve as an anatomic feature of a safe dissec-
tion space between the important structures of the triangle
of Calot.
DISCUSSION
During surgical residency a common question intended to
""trip up"" junior residents during division of the cystic artery,
has been to ask them to define the cystic vein. It is usually
pointed out to the less assured that there is no cystic vein

per se, but that the venous drainage is through the bed of
the liver. 
In contradistinction to this, however, Grant's
Anatomy, in illustrating the veins of the extrahepatic bile
passages and gallbladder (Figure 4), clearly demonstrates
venous drainage directly into the liver, and describes
venous twigs which ""clinging to the passages""....join
branches of the portal vein.6 
Gray's Anatomy of the
Human Body likewise describes cystic veins which join at
the neck of the gallbladder to form either single or double
cystic veins which flow along the cystic duct and upward
along the hepatic ducts.7
Textbooks of surgery, however, do not assign much impor-
tance to the venous drainage of the gallbladder. The
Textbook of Surgery edited by Sabiston reports only that the
venous drainage of the gallbladder and extrahepatic ducts
is into the portal vein.""8 Schwartz's Principles of Surgery
describes the venous drainage as ""variable and generally
does not run parallel with the arteries.""9 Neither text has
venous anatomy within the diagrams of the region. A
prominent surgical atlas similarly omits all veins from it's
anatomic diagrams and does not describe operative man-
agement of these structures during the procedure.10
One of the differences between laparoscopic and open
surgery is that magnification of the anatomy gives a new
perspective to the dissection process. The magnified field
of view demands meticulous attention to operative detail
lest bleeding from a source not significant during open
cholecystectomy, completely obscures the field during
laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

The Cystic Vein: the Significance of a Forgotten Anatomic Landmark, Fine A.
This fractal* anatomic view uncovered the presence of
venous structures within the triangle of Calot, which, if not
clipped or cauterized prior to division, would obscure the
operative field. Only with experience did we find the pres-
ence of the cystic veins to be constant. During difficult
cases, the cystic veins can serve as a landmark for that
space between cystic duct, cystic artery and common bile
duct, that allows for safe handling and isolation of these
vital structures.
A review of anatomy texts has shown that the cystic veins
were known to classical anatomists. It was only later that,
without apparent clinical relevance, a description of the
cystic veins was omitted from surgical textbooks and their
very existence devolved into a trick question for unsus-
pecting house staff.
I do not doubt that experienced laparoscopic surgeons
have encountered these venous structures and are dealing
with them on a regular basis, but that they exist as a reli-
able anatomic feature of the region is not well appreciated.
Certainly it now can be pointed out that there is a constant
cystic vein. Its importance, however, may lie in the fact that
the cystic vein can serve as a landmark during a difficult
laparoscopic cholecystectomy to decrease the risk of inad-
vertent bile duct injury.

This review summarises the role that reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species play in demyelination,
such as that occurring in the inflammatory demyeli-
nating disorders multiple sclerosis and Guillain-
Barré syndrome.The concentrations of reactive oxy-
gen and nitrogen species (e.g. superoxide, nitric
oxide and peroxynitrite) can increase dramatically
under conditions such as inflammation, and this can
overwhelm the inherent antioxidant defences within
lesions. Such oxidative and/or nitrative stress can
damage the lipids, proteins and nucleic acids of cells
and mitochondria, potentially causing cell death.
Oligodendrocytes are more sensitive to oxidative
and nitrative stress in vitro than are astrocytes and
microglia, seemingly due to a diminished capacity
for antioxidant defence, and the presence of raised
risk factors, including a high iron content. Oxidative
and nitrative stress might therefore result in vivo in
selective oligodendrocyte death,
and thereby
demyelination. The reactive species may also dam-
age the myelin sheath, promoting its attack by
macrophages. Damage can occur directly by lipid
peroxidation, and indirectly by the activation of pro-
teases and phospholipase A2. Evidence for the exis-
tence of oxidative and nitrative stress within inflam-
matory demyelinating lesions includes the presence
of both lipid and protein peroxides, and nitrotyrosine
(a marker for peroxynitrite formation). The neurolog-
ical deficit resulting from experimental autoimmune
demyelinating disease has generally been reduced
by trial therapies intended to diminish the concen-
tration of reactive oxygen species. However, thera-
pies aimed at diminishing reactive nitrogen species
have had a more variable outcome, sometimes exac-
erbating disease.
Recent years have witnessed a burgeoning of interest
in the role that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
(ROS and RNS) play in inflammation, and also in the
role that inflammation plays in multiple sclerosis (MS).
These interests have naturally focused attention on the
potential role of ROS and RNS in demyelinating dis-
ease, the subject of this review. 
Oxidative And Nitrative Stress
Cells within the nervous system are routinely
exposed to low concentrations of potentially deleterious
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, but these normal-
ly pose little threat since cells possess an arsenal of
defence and repair mechanisms. However, events such
as inflammation can conspire to increase the production
of these reactive species dramatically, and this may
overwhelm the cell’s defences resulting in a condition
known as oxidative and/or nitrative “stress”. Such stress
may lead to changes in the properties of the cell’s con-
stituent molecules, notably the lipids, proteins and
nucleic acids. The ROS and RNS of primary concern are
the superoxide anion (O2●-, hereafter called superoxide),
nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide,
●NO)', peroxynitrite
(ONOO-; a product of the combination of superoxide
and nitric oxide), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the
hydroxyl radical (●OH). Other potentially important
species include singlet oxygen (1O2), nitrogen dioxide
radical (NO2
●), nitrosonium (NO+) and nitronium (NO2
+)

ions, the perhydroxyl radical (HO2
●), and hypochlorous
acid (HOCl), but since there is little direct evidence so
far that these species play an important role in demyeli-
nation, they will not be discussed in this review. The
reactions initiated by the reactive species include perox-
idation of lipids, nitrosylation of thiol groups, nitration
of tyrosine, and oxidation and deamination of nucleic
acids. Reactions such as these may directly, or indirect-
ly, result in demyelination. If this is correct, then novel
therapies for demyelinating disorders may arise from
the introduction of strategies aimed at modifying the
production and fate of ROS and RNS. This review
describes the evidence that ROS and RNS play a role in
demyelination, the mechanisms believed to be involved,
and observations made from trial therapies in demyeli-
nating disorders. 
Inherent Vulnerability Of The Nervous System To
Oxidative Damage
The CNS is inherently vulnerable to damage mediat-
ed by ROS. First, it is very active in oxidative metabo-
lism. Such activity results in a relatively high intracellu-
lar production of superoxide, since 2-5% of the oxygen
consumed in mitochondrial electron transport is con-
verted to superoxide. Superoxide is converted by the
enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) to hydrogen per-
oxide and oxygen (98). Hydrogen peroxide is normally
reduced to water by the action of catalase or glutathione
peroxidase (with reduced glutathione as co-substrate),
but in the presence of decompartmentalised transition
metals such as iron and copper it can be converted to the
highly toxic hydroxyl radical (98). This radical is so
reactive that it has a diffusion radius of only approxi-
mately 0.3 nm before it interacts with another molecule
(11). For comparison, the interlamellar spacing of
myelin is approximately 10 nm. Second, the CNS has a
very limited ability to conduct anaerobic glycolysis, and
so it is unusually vulnerable to hypoxia. This is a con-
cern since the production of superoxide by mitochondria
increases dramatically in low oxygen concentrations
(reviewed in (10)). Third, some cells in the CNS,
notably oligodendrocytes, have relatively low levels of
antioxidant defences combined with a high iron content
and extensive elaborations of membranes. These fea-
tures all predispose oligodendrocytes, in particular, to
oxidative damage. Finally, myelin membrane is a pref-
erential target of ROS (24) due to its composition and
high lipid to protein ratio. 
It has been proposed that the brain may be much
more vulnerable to oxidative stress than the spinal cord
or peripheral nerve (139). However, the levels of the
antioxidant glutathione and glutathione related enzyme
activities appear to be lower in peripheral nervous tissue
than in the central nervous system, suggesting that this
protective mechanism, at least, is less effective in the
peripheral nervous system (188). 
Cellular Oxidative Defence Mechanisms
Cells employ a range of defence mechanisms to pro-
tect themselves from oxidative and nitrative injury. The
strategy includes mechanisms to limit the production of
reactive species, to scavenge any radicals that are pro-
duced, to prevent the proliferation of secondary radicals
in chain reactions, and to repair the damage that may
nevertheless occur. This strategy is achieved by the pres-
ence of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, glutathione
peroxidase and catalase, and low molecular weight
antioxidants such as glutathione and dietary vitamins C
and E. There are two forms of SOD. Mn-SOD is located
in mitochondria, and Cu/Zn-SOD is located within the
cytosol. Both isoforms specifically catalyse the dismuta-
tion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen,
thereby protecting cells from the formation of the more
harmful peroxynitrite. Glutathione peroxidase is an
important cytosolic selenium-containing enzyme which
converts peroxides, notably hydrogen peroxide and lipid
peroxides, to water and oxygen. The enzyme requires
reduced glutathione as an electron donor. Catalase con-
verts hydrogen peroxide in peroxisomes to water and
oxygen. Glutathione is pivotal to oxidative defence and
performs the non-specific reduction of many ROS and
RNS. It can also reactivate some enzymes which have
been inhibited by exposure to oxidants. Glutathione is
found at high concentrations in cells, particularly in
astrocytes (~5 mM) (230). Vitamin C (ascorbate) is
another important, non-specific antioxidant, which accu-
mulates in the CNS particularly in astrocytes (up to 10
mM) (208, 209). Vitamin C can regenerate glutathione
and vitamin E from their radicals in vitro, returning them
to the antioxidant pool. Vitamin E (a-tocopherol) is a
lipid soluble antioxidant, and forms a primary defence
against lipid peroxidation. It can break the chain reac-
tions of lipid peroxidation by reducing peroxyl radicals.
The chemical biology of ROS and RNS has been
reviewed in detail elsewhere (98, 186, 249). 
Other recent reviews of potential interest examine the
neurobiology of ●NO (259), the role of ●NO in mito-
chondrial damage (19), the effects of oxidative stress on
astrocytes (173), the role of astrocytes in antioxidant
defence (245), and the role of microglia in brain damage
(151). 
The Role Of Nitric Oxide In Demyelination
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
70
●NO has important physiological roles in the regula-
tion of vascular tone, in intra- and inter-cellular commu-
nication, and in the destruction of microbes and tumour
cells (for review see (226)). It is an important inflam-
matory mediator which also appears to exert significant
effects in inflammatory demyelinating diseases. 
Elementary Chemistry of Nitric Oxide. ●NO is pro-
duced from L-arginine by a family of homodimeric
enzymes, termed nitric oxide synthases (NOS), which
require several co-substrates and co-factors, including
oxygen, and NADPH. The family is made up of three
members, nNOS (for “neuronal” NOS; also termed type
I NOS), eNOS (for “endothelial”; also termed type III)
and iNOS (for “immunological”, “inflammatory” or,
most commonly, “inducible”; also termed type II) which
are the products of separate genes on different chromo-
somes. Two forms, eNOS and nNOS, are expressed con-
stitutively in endothelial cells and in some neurons
respectively, and have collectively been termed cNOS.
The inducible form, iNOS, differs from cNOS in two
important ways. First, it produces relatively large
amounts of ●NO compared to cNOS, and second, it is
effectively independent of Ca++ (for review see (151)). 
●NO itself is not thought to be highly toxic at the con-
centrations formed in vivo. However ●NO reacts rapidly
with some molecules, particularly transition metals and
other free radicals, and these reactions can lead to the
formation of more damaging species (12). ●NO has a
short half-life (~1 second) in tissues. The chemistry of
●NO and its derivatives is complex (reviewed in (11, 12,
14, 59)). Notably,
●NO combines with superoxide to
form the potent oxidising and nitrating agent, peroxyni-
trite. The rate constant for this reaction is sufficiently
high that ●NO out-competes SOD for superoxide (110).
However, the relatively high concentration of SOD in
the cell usually means that intracellular superoxide con-
centrations are kept sufficiently low that peroxynitrite
formation is normally minimal. Under some conditions,
however, such as during the oxidative burst, excess
superoxide is produced and then extracellular peroxyni-
trite formation can be substantial (for review see (12)).
Peroxynitrite is very reactive, and has a short half-life
(milliseconds) in tissues. There is evidence that reaction
of peroxynitrite in the presence of carbon dioxide
enhances its nitrating properties. In fact, it is now
believed that many of the deleterious effects ascribed to
●NO may in reality be due to peroxynitrite and the
agents derived from it (including peroxynitrous acid,
hydroxyl radicals and nitrogen dioxide radicals, and the
nitronium ion). Therefore, reference to “●NO” in this
review should not be taken to exclude its metabolic
derivatives (i.e. peroxynitrite etc.).
The Production Of Nitric Oxide In The Nervous
System In Response To Inflammation. The induction of
iNOS, or the production of substantial amounts of ●NO,
has been reported in astrocytes (102, 206), microglia
(18, 47, 264), a subset of oligodendrocytes (148),
Schwann cells (82), and cerebral endothelium (26, 202).
In addition, iNOS induction has been widely reported in
macrophages and other cells which can invade the ner-
vous system and participate in inflammatory reactions.
Typically, the induction of iNOS is achieved experimen-
tally by stimulation of cells with bacterial cell wall
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and/or the use of pro-inflam-
matory cytokines such as interferon-g (IFNg). However,
CSF from 34% (13/38) of MS patients has been found
to promote ●NO production in mixed cultures of rat
oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes, vs. only
10% (2/20) of CSF samples from controls. Increasing
●NO concentrations were accompanied by a proportion-
al reduction in the number of viable oligodendrocytes
(253).
Much of the work on the stimulation of iNOS expres-
sion has been carried out on rodent macrophages, but
species differences can be prominent. While cultured
human microglia have sometimes been reported to
express iNOS upon LPS stimulation (42), other studies
have not observed this effect (44, 43, 138). Human
macrophages are, however, capable of producing signif-
icant amounts of ●NO in response to certain stimuli,
including exposure to certain protozoans (203). There
are also likely to be species differences in the control of
iNOS expression (for review see (69)), suggesting that
particular caution is needed when extrapolating rodent
data to humans. Human astrocytes, in contrast with
macrophages, are capable of producing substantial ●NO
in response to stimulation by proinflammatory
cytokines (see below)(108, 138), although iNOS expres-
sion is not affected by LPS exposure (138). 
Control of Nitric Oxide Production. Most studies in
this field suggest that the control of iNOS expression
occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level and
involves a number of transcription factors, including
nuclear factor kappa-B (for review see (151)).
Differences in transcription factor expression and the
differential presence of consensus sequences are likely
to be related to observed differences in species and tis-
sue expression of iNOS. Post-transcriptional control of
iNOS also occurs. For example, in mouse macrophages,
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
71
transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) reduces iNOS
activity by destabilising iNOS mRNA, reducing transla-
tion and increasing the degradation of iNOS (238).
The up-regulation of ●NO production in glia using
LPS, or LPS+IFNg, has been shown to involve mitogen-
activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades. Specific inhi-
bition of either of two MAP kinases (extracellular sig-
nal-regulated kinase (ERK) or p38 kinase) reduces both
the expression of iNOS and the production of ●NO in
primary cultures of rat glia, while inhibition of both
kinases leads to almost complete inhibition (13). 
The immune response encompasses a number of
chemical interactions which regulate ●NO production.
For example, there is evidence that some eicosanoids
can down-regulate ●NO production. Addition of exoge-
nous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to rat microglial cells
down-regulates iNOS by increasing cAMP levels (152),
and inhibition of cyclooxygenase increases ●NO produc-
tion in activated human astrocytes (116). Paradoxically,
however, inhibition of cyclooxygenase in rat microglia
decreases iNOS expression (152). These findings indi-
cate that products of the arachidonic acid cascade may
have both positive and negative regulatory effects on
●NO production. ●NO also participates in its own regula-
tion. In activated astrocytes, the addition of ●NO -trap-
ping agents increases the transcription of iNOS, indicat-
ing that ●NO provides direct negative feedback on the
enzyme responsible for its generation (170). An impor-
tant “sink” for the removal of ●NO is the vasculature,
since ●NO readily diffuses through tissue and reacts with
oxyhaemoglobin to form methaemoglobin.
Cytokines also have a significant effect on iNOS
expression and ●NO production. In general, the pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1a (IL-1a)
(236), IL-1b (138, 207), IFNg (207) and tumour necro-
sis factor-a (TNFa) (155) induce, or increase, the pro-
duction of ●NO in glia. The cytokines can act synergisti-
cally: for example, neither IFNg nor TNFa cause sig-
nificant ●NO production by cultured astrocytes, but the
combination of cytokines elicits a strong response (223).
Glia can themselves synthesize cytokines which in turn
lead to further up-regulation of iNOS. For example, the
release of TNFa from astrocytes can cause the expres-
sion of iNOS in the cerebral endothelium (202). There is
also recent evidence that TNFa and ●NO may mutually
provoke the production of the other in vitro (223). Anti-
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 (207), IL-10 (207)
and TGF-b1 (TGF-b1) (237) decrease the production of
●NO in activated rodent glia in culture. Reports of simi-
lar suppression in human astrocytes vary. Liu et al.
(138) found no inhibition of iNOS or ●NO production,
while Hu et al (108) found that all three cytokines acted
as potent inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokine-
induced ●NO production in cultured human fetal astro-
cytes. IFNb, which primarily exhibits anti-inflammato-
ry properties, reduces ●NO production in an astrocytoma
cell line (90) and in primary astrocyte cultures (109). In
some cases, the inhibitory action of these cytokines is
mediated by blocking the production of pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines (168). Thus the control of iNOS by
cytokines involves both positive and negative interac-
tions.
●NO production by phagocytes can be affected by
exposure to myelin. Phagocytosis of rat myelin by rat
macrophages in vitro leads to an increased production of
●NO, and this effect can be enhanced by opsonizing the
myelin with anti-myelin antibodies (157). The effect of
phagocytosis is not limited to myelin, since activated
microglia also produce more ●NO after phagocytosing
certain bacteria and latex beads (53). 
There is also evidence that cells can modulate their
expression of their oxidative and nitrative defence
mechanisms, either in response to the challenge of
oxidative and nitrative stress, or even in anticipation of
such challenge. For example, cultured microglial cells
respond to a LPS challenge by the induction of enzymes
which produce high, antimicrobial concentrations of
●NO. However, since the microglial cell may itself be
impaired by such ●NO concentrations, it appears first to
render itself resistant to the effects of ●NO: these mea-
sures are instituted in response to even low LPS con-
centrations (222). Furthermore, and presumably in an
effort to avoid the toxicity of peroxynitrite, it appears
that cells which can produce both superoxide and ●NO
tend to stagger their production so that both radicals are
not produced at the same time. In part this may be
achieved by the inhibition by ●NO of the factors
involved in superoxide production, and in part by the
fact that the agents which stimulate ●NO production typ-
ically do not also stimulate superoxide production (see
(44) for discussion). However, it seems likely that this
ingenious protection will be compromised in areas of
inflammation, populated as they are by different types
of cell presumably sometimes at different stages of acti-
vation. If so, then peroxynitrite formation may be antic-
ipated in inflammatory lesions within the nervous sys-
tem, and, indeed, there is evidence for this in MS lesions
(see nitrotyrosine labelling under “MS” below). 
Evidence For The Involvement Of Nitric Oxide In
Demyelination. The diversity of interactions between
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
72
the host of inflammatory mediators make it difficult to
establish a direct and causal link between ●NO and
demyelination. For example, even if the inhibition of
●NO production can be shown to prevent demyelination,
●NO may not act directly to damage myelin or myeli-
nating cells, but rather act by the induction or enhance-
ment of other factors. However there is substantial indi-
rect evidence that ●NO at least participates in demyeli-
nation, from work on a number of demyelinating dis-
eases and disease models. 
Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis And
Neuritis. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) and neuritis (EAN) are primarily T cell-mediated
inflammatory disorders of the CNS and PNS which
serve as models of MS and Guillain-Barré syndrome
(GBS) 
respectively. 
Increased 
proinflammatory
cytokine expression has been demonstrated in both EAE
(146) and EAN (220), implying that increased ●NO pro-
duction is likely to occur. Indeed, increased iNOS
expression has been demonstrated in the CNS of ani-
mals with EAE. By measuring ●NO levels directly using
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Lin et al. (136)
found a statistically significant increases in the signal
associated with iron-nitrosyl complexes in the spinal
cords of mice with adoptive transfer EAE. Exogenously
applied spin-traps have also been utilised with EPR to
demonstrate increased ●NO in the spinal cords of ani-
mals with both adoptive transfer (106) and actively
induced (105) EAE. Unfortunately, absolute levels of
●NO are difficult to determine, but these studies suggest
that the level of ●NO in the spinal cord in passsive EAE
lies between 6 and 30 mM (105, 106). This concentra-
tion is high (●NO functions as a physiological messenger
at nanomolar concentrations), and higher than that at
which ●NO has effects on axonal conduction (183) (see
below). Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction techniques (RT-PCR) (55, 130, 167) and
ribonuclease protection assay (55), a significant increase
(up to 10-30 fold) in iNOS mRNA has been demon-
strated in the CNS of animals during the acute phase of
adoptive transfer (55) or actively induced (130, 167)
EAE. In contrast to animals with passive transfer EAE
(55), animals with MBP-induced EAE demonstrate a
second phase of iNOS up-regulation during the chronic
phase of the disease (167), but this is not matched by a
concomitant 
decline 
in 
neurological 
signs.
Immunohistochemical techniques have revealed both
increased iNOS expression in the spinal cords of mice
with EAE (57, 167, 235), and immunoreactivity for
nitrotyrosine, indicating the presence of peroxynitrite
and its derivatives in the lesions (56, 57, 235).
Multiple Sclerosis. Indirect evidence that ●NO plays a
role in MS lesions includes the observations that pro-
inflammatory cytokines including TNFa (104, 201) and
IFNg (36, 233) have been identified in astrocytes with-
in MS lesions. IFNg (137), IL-1 (149) and TNFa (162)
have also been found within peripheral mononuclear
cells and cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and
cultured peripheral monocytes have been shown to
express more ●NO in patients with active disease (197).
Some studies have also shown that nitrite and nitrate
(metabolites of ●NO) are significantly elevated within
the CSF of MS patients (56, 80, 119), and that the lev-
els are directly related to disease state (56, 254).
However, other studies found no such evidence in either
MS or GBS (114). 
There is, however, direct evidence that ●NO is pro-
duced within MS lesions. iNOS mRNA is elevated in
MS plaques (17), and is located chiefly in cells of the
monocyte/microglial lineage (8, 62, 105). Dual-label
histochemistry using anti-NOS antibodies and cell spe-
cific markers has shown that macrophages/microglia
within actively demyelinating lesions express high lev-
els of both iNOS (8, 62, 105) and cNOS (62). Astrocytes
in active MS lesions have been reported to express
cNOS (62) rather than iNOS (62, 105), and their expres-
sion of NOS is consistent with their positive staining for
NADPH-diaphorase (17, 31, 62). Finally, as noted
above, ●NO can combine with superoxide to form per-
oxynitrite, and although this may be relatively short
lived within lesions, it (or its derivatives) can nitrate
tyrosine to produce the relatively stable ""footprint"" mol-
ecule nitrotyrosine. Increased nitrotyrosine reactivity is
present in MS brains (8, 105), particularly in areas of
demyelination and inflammation (56). Taken together
these studies demonstrate the presence of increased pro-
duction of ●NO within MS lesions.
Viral Demyelinating Disorders. There is also direct
evidence of ●NO involvement in a viral disorder which
has a demyelinating component. In mice infected with
the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM
(MHV-JHM), there is an acute, non-demyelinating
phase, and a chronic, demyelinating phase. During the
demyelinating phase, in situ hybridization and immuno-
histochemistry have demonstrated that iNOS expression
is up-regulated in astrocytes in and around the demyeli-
nated lesions (89, 224). 
Consequences Of Nitric Oxide Production On Cells
Within The Nervous System. Although the evidence
presented above indicates that ●NO production is
increased in inflammatory demyelinating diseases, the
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
73
relative contributions made by ●NO, compared with the
derivatives of ●NO, to pathophysiology remains unclear.
Increasingly, it is felt that many of the actions formerly
ascribed to ●NO may, in fact, be mediated by short-lived,
but highly reactive, molecules, such as peroxynitrite and
its derivatives. Significant amounts of peroxynitrite are
likely to be generated, since every 10-fold increase in
●NO and superoxide formation leads to an approximate-
ly 100-fold increase in peroxynitrite formation (180).
There is also evidence in vitro that where the concentra-
tion of the arginine substrate of NOS is low, the NOS
enzyme can produce superoxide, resulting in peroxyni-
trite-mediated cytotoxicity (252). Certainly, ●NO toxici-
ty is often enhanced considerably by the accompanying
presence of superoxide (21, 169), and hence the pre-
sumed formation of peroxynitrite. 
●NO or peroxynitrite can have a wide variety of
effects on cellular systems by modifying protein struc-
ture, and thereby function. The two main target sites for
●NO in the cell are thiols and metalloproteins.
Nitrosylation of thiols to yield nitrosothiols (R-SH +
●NO = R-SNO + H+ + e-) occurs under physiological
conditions (217) and appears to by controlled by the rel-
ative rates of production of ●NO and superoxide (246).
Nitrosothiols can sometimes act like ●NO in biological
systems, and they can function as temporary stores of
●NO, effectively increasing its half-life. Although thiol
interactions occur more readily, peroxynitrite (or a
derivative from it) is also capable of nitrating tyrosine to
form nitrotyrosine, and it has been reported that this
reaction can be catalyzed by metalloenzymes such as
SOD (115). Peroxynitrite can also nitrate tryptophan
residues (3), although the physiological significance of
this reaction is not known. Beckman et al. (11) have
pointed out that even apparently simple reactions, such
as the nitosylation of thiols by ●NO, may in fact be quite
complex and involve the production of intermediates
such as the nitrosonium ion. 
●NO has been shown to inhibit several enzymes,
including protein kinase C (81), and enzymes involved
in mitochondrial respiration including aconitase,
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and succinate-
ubiquinone oxidoreductase (216). Production of
endogenous ●NO has been shown to inhibit mitochondr-
ial respiration in cultured rat astrocytes (32). This is
reflected in an inhibition of the mitochondrial respirato-
ry chain enzyme nicotinamide dinucleotide-dehydroge-
nase in CNS macrophages/microglia isolated from ani-
mals with EAE (263). These actions on multiple mem-
bers of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may be
expected to cause deficits in cellular energy supplies,
and indeed ATP content is reduced in neurons exposed
to ●NO. ●NO also affects the activities of several of the
enzymes involved in oxidative defence, including cata-
lase, glutathione peroxidase, and Mn-SOD which are all
inhibited in C6 cells by exposure to an ●NO donor (68).
In addition to these effects, reactions of proteins with
●NO/peroxynitrite may have adverse consequences via
the production of neo-epitopes which may provoke an
immune reaction, including the production of antibod-
ies. There is evidence to suggest that this phenomenon
can occur in MS since some patients show a significant
IgM antibody reaction to S-nitroso-cysteine (27). 
Peroxynitrite can lead to cell death by several mech-
anisms, including the nitration of tyrosine residues
thereby affecting signalling, direct interaction with
DNA (for review see (225)), or by causing DNA strand
breakages or deamination. Such breakages result in acti-
vation of the enzyme poly-(ADP)-ribose synthetase,
which in turn leads to rapid depletion of cellular stores
of NAD+ and ATP (34), and potentially to cell death.
●NO can also damage DNA directly by deamination
(248), and inhibit the repair activity of the enzyme DNA
ligase (85).
Both ●NO and peroxynitrite can affect lipid peroxida-
tion (179), and this is an important consequence of ●NO
production since lipid peroxidation can affect mem-
brane fluidity and membrane permeability, and it can
alter the function of proteins embedded in the lipid
bilayer. ●NO and peroxynitrite can have opposing effects
on lipid peroxidation, depending upon the circum-
stances. If superoxide production exceeds that of ●NO,
peroxynitrite is formed and this promotes lipid peroxi-
dation (179, 190). If, however, the concentration of ●NO
is high, lipid peroxidation is decreased because ●NO
serves as a potent terminator of the radical chain propa-
gation reactions involved. ●NO has this effect because it
reacts directly with the alkoxyl and peroxyl radical
intermediates formed during lipid peroxidation (179).
●NO was not found to induce lipid peroxidation,
although this role has been claimed in some literature.
The data show that ●NO formation can therefore have
either prooxidant or antioxidant consequences depend-
ing upon the concentrations of superoxide and ●NO.
This diversity of action may help to explain the different
effects observed in therapeutic trials based on ●NO inhi-
bition in experimental models of inflammatory demyeli-
nation (see “Antioxidant Therapy” below). 
Gangliosides often show neuroprotective properties,
and it has been suggested that this effect may be due to
the inhibition of ●NO formation (61). In support of this
theory, the neuroprotective effects of gangliosides paral-
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination

lel their potency in binding calmodulin in vitro (61), and
thereby blocking ●NO formation. 
Sensitivity of Oligodendrocyes and Axons to ●NO.
Experiments with cultured oligodendrocytes by Merrill
and colleagues (145) have yielded the potentially very
important observation that these cells are more suscepti-
ble to ●NO-mediated damage than are astrocytes or
microglia. Furthermore, activated microglial cells
appear to be able to produce sufficient ●NO to lyse
oligodendrocytes in co-culture, and this lysis can be pre-
vented by antagonists of ●NO production. It may be sig-
nificant that oligodendrocytes are more sensitive to
●NO-induced single stranded DNA breaks than are
astrocytes or microglia (153), although oligodendrocyte
death apparently occurs by necrotic, rather than apop-
totic mechanisms (154). 
Although MS is primarily a demyelinating disease,
an important cause of the permanent disability in pro-
gressive disease is believed to be axonal loss. It may
therefore be of interest that axonal loss appears to be
related to the degree of inflammation in lesions (232),
and that our recent studies have shown that ●NO may
play a role in axonal loss (213). This role may be accen-
tuated if ●NO exposure occurs in conjunction with phys-
iological levels of axonal impulse activity (213). 
Effects of nitric oxide on ion channels and the elec-
trophysiological function of axons. In recent years it has
become clear that the inflammatory response can play
an important part in the pathophysiology of inflamma-
tory demyelinating diseases (156, 258). The data sug-
gest that inflammation can cause axonal conduction
block, and that this can lead to significant symptomatol-
ogy in these conditions. How inflammation causes con-
duction block in human disease is not known, but recent
studies in our laboratory (183) have demonstrated that
●NO, or its derivatives, can block conduction in central
and peripheral axons in vivo, and similar observations
have been made by Shrager’s group in vitro (204).
Interestingly, we found that demyelinated axons were
especially vulnerable to ●NO -mediated block, and that
this effect was observed at concentrations of ●NO antic-
ipated at sites of inflammation (183). These observa-
tions raise the intriguing possibility that ●NO production
may be responsible for some of the symptoms in MS
and other inflammatory demyelinating disorders. If so,
then strategies to lower ●NO concentrations may form an
effective therapy for patients with MS. The mecha-
nism(s) underlying ●NO -mediated conduction block are
not yet known, but may involve direct effects of ●NO on
ion channels. The redox state of thiols is well known to
affect the conduction properties of axons (reviewed in
(188)), and several studies have shown that ●NO can act
as a modulator of ion channel currents. Consistent with
such findings, ●NO has been found to inhibit both action
potential discharge (143) and sodium currents in barore-
ceptor neurons (135). ●NO also affects currents through
Ca++-dependent potassium channels (22), photoreceptor
Ca++ channels and glutamate ionotropic channels (71).
Actions of ●NO involving cGMP are well known (74),
but these effects appear to be independent of cGMP, and
are apparently due to direct interaction with the channel
(see also (39)). Surprisingly, the block of axonal con-
duction observed in vitro was dependent upon an intact
nerve sheath (204). This observation argues against a
direct effect of ●NO on ion channels, and the authors
proposed a mechanism where an endoneurial intermedi-
ate molecule may react with ●NO and then with the ion
channel. 
Taken together, the findings from this and the pre-
ceding section suggest that ●NO may play an important
role in MS, possibly affecting demyelination, conduc-
tion block and axonal loss.
The 
Role 
Of 
Reactive 
Oxygen 
Species 
In
Demyelination
Production Of Reactive Oxygen Species. In com-
mon with other tissues, neural tissues generate ROS
constantly as part of their normal functioning. Potential
sources of ROS include enzymatic pathways in the
mitochondrial electron transport chain, xanthine oxi-
dase, NADPH oxidase, lipoxygenase and cyclooxyge-
nase, as well as non-enzymatic mechanisms such as the
auto-oxidation of dopamine and noradrenaline.
Mitochondrial respiration is an important source of ROS
within the brain, since this organ utilises approximately
20% of the total oxygen taken in each day, and approx-
imately 3% of this is converted to superoxide.
Peroxisomes are another source of ROS, and they are
abundant in oligodendroglial cells during the period of
active myelination. 
Although resting microglia produce only small quan-
tities of ROS, this can increase substantially upon their
activation (e.g. with IFNg (251) or phorbol myristate
acetate (196), and it may be significant that microglia
can become highly activated in inflammatory demyeli-
nating lesions. Cultured human microglia activated by
phorbol myristate acetate are especially potent in super-
oxide production in comparison with other species (43)
see also (227), and production is significantly further
increased if the microglia are “primed” by exposure to
the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNg or IL-1a (46):
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
75
such exposure would be expected in an inflammatory
lesion. The superoxide is produced largely extracellular-
ly as part of the “respiratory burst” phenomenon com-
mon to macrophages, neutrophils etc, and mediated by
the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (98, 196),
although other generators may also be involved (44).
Cells capable of significant superoxide production via
the respiratory burst can be recruited to lesions within
the nervous system in inflammatory demyelinating dis-
eases. Phagocytic cells are known to be closely associ-
ated with myelin sheaths in some such disorders and
may act as a concentrated source of ROS. The ROS and
RNS formed may directly damage the myelin sheath,
promoting attack by macrophages. Indeed, peroxynitrite
converts low density lipoprotein to a form recognised by
the macrophage scavenger receptor (84). 
Neurons may make an important contribution to ROS
production, since it is known that neuronal electrical
activity can promote the formation of ROS (23).
Important mechanisms probably include the direct
transaxolemmal entry of calcium ions as part of excita-
tory activity, and the release of calcium from intracellu-
lar pools. The calcium ions can activate phospholipase
A2, leading to the release of arachidonic acid and the
initiation of the cascade resulting in the formation of
prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes by
cyclooxygenases and lipooxygenases. These enzymes
utilise molecular oxygen, and can generate ROS as they
function. It may be significant in this respect that axon-
al activity may be greater than normal in demyelinating
diseases such as MS. The increase can result either from
the development of sustained, spontaneous, repetitive
discharges in demyelinated axons (122, 214, 212), or
from the enhanced firing rates of spared axons presumed
to occur in compensation for the function lost in axons
blocked by demyelination (211). Massed synchronous
discharges have also been reported. Electrical activity,
especially the massed activity which has occasionally
been reported in demyelinating disease (212), is also
accompanied by a significant increase in extracellular
potassium concentration. Elevated potassium levels may
be predicted to be especially large in those MS lesions
which have a reduced density of astrocytes (e.g. “open”
lesions (9)), since these cells are believed to buffer the
extracellular potassium concentration. The raised extra-
cellular potassium concentration may raise ROS levels
further since it has been found to increase superoxide
production by cultured microglia activated by exposure
to phorbol myristate acetate (45).
Inflammatory demyelinating lesions, such as those in
MS and GBS, are also likely to contain T lymphocytes
among the inflammatory infiltrate. These cells have not
been shown to produce ROS as part of their normal
function, but a modification of their mitochondria can
result in superoxide production during the early stages
of apoptosis (142, 260). Since these cells are not known
to produce ●NO it is interesting that CD4+ cells can show
immunoreactivity for nitrotyrosine in EAE lesions (57).
Nitrotryrosine is a marker for the former presence of
peroxynitrite, and it is possible that this potent oxidising
agent is formed by the combination of ●NO diffusing
from nearby cells reacting with superoxide produced by
imminently apoptotic T cells (57). 
Mature oligodendrocytes are not believed to be major
producers of ROS, but increased ROS formation is like-
ly to occur in oligodendrocytes during myelination. This
increase arises both because of the energy demands of
myelin formation, and because myelin synthesis
involves lipid synthesis in peroxisomes. These
organelles increase in number during myelinogenesis
(5), and they can produce significant quantities of super-
oxide, and thereby the production of hydrogen peroxide
through the action of SOD ((234) see also below). 
Evidence For Increased ROS Production In
Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease. There is con-
vincing evidence that ROS production is a prominent
feature of inflammatory demyelinating diseases. The
evidence is derived from observations in animal and
human disease, and by inference from the success of
several therapeutic trials based on the manipulation of
ROS production (see “Antioxidant Therapy”). 
Lipid Peroxidation. Evidence of ROS generation in
the brains of patients has been derived either indirectly,
from measurements of the products of lipid oxygenation
during the course of the illness, or directly, after death.
The indirect evidence has been partly conflicting. An
early study found evidence of lipid peroxidation in the
CSF of patients with MS, but not in the plasma (111),
but a subsequent study found evidence in the serum, but
not the CSF (158) see also (81). In the latter study (158),
no correlation was identified between levels of lipid per-
oxides and disease severity or time since relapse.
However, as the authors pointed out, few of their
patients had severe disability or a long relapse-free
interval. The authors considered that elevated CSF lev-
els of peroxidation products were absent either because
there was no increase in CSF lipid peroxidation or, more
likely, because CSF lipid peroxides were removed rapid-
ly following their generation. Another study (35) found
evidence of significantly higher concentrations of mal-
ondialdehyde in patient CSF, together with altered levels
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
76
of enzymes involved in oxidative defence: the activity of
glutathione reductase was significantly increased, where-
as the activity of glutathione peroxidase was markedly
decreased. In a recent study, lipid peroxidation in plasma
and CSF samples were not detected above control levels
in patients with MS or aseptic meningitis, but a signifi-
cant increase was detected in plasma samples from
patients with GBS (91). The authors drew a tentative cor-
relation between this finding and the observation that
plasma exchange can shorten the course of disease in
GBS. Raised concentrations of the antioxidant protein
haptoglobin were detected specifically in GBS, but no
significant increase was detected in lipid peroxidation in
the CSF of GBS patients (91). Evidence of lipid peroxi-
dation was sought in another study by measuring the
breath levels of pentane (derived from linoleic acid) and
ethane (derived from linolenic acid) as markers (231).
Ethane levels were found to remain stable, but pentane
rose significantly during acute exacerbations of MS.
Excretion of pentane subsequently fell when patients
entered clinical remission. However, it has subsequently
been claimed that all measurements of breath pentane
may be invalid due to technical artifacts (215). 
Direct evidence of lipid peroxidation has been
demonstrated in post-mortem MS brain. High pressure
liquid chromatography was used to demonstrate an
increase in uric acid in MS plaques, with a correspond-
ing decrease in glutathione (132). The levels of the lipid
radical scavenger vitamin E (a-tocopherol) were lowest
in plaques and highest in distant white matter.
Newcombe et al. (164) used immunocytochemical tech-
niques to detect low density lipoprotein (LDL) and LDL
modified by the lipid peroxidation products, malondi-
aldehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal in early and actively
demyelinating plaques. Both LDL, which may enter the
CNS after blood brain barrier damage in the acute
inflammatory lesion, and its oxidation product were
found in foamy macrophages within lesions, and also in
astrocytes. These findings point to lipid peroxidation as
an early event in the evolution of the plaque. Further
direct evidence of oxidative damage to lipids, and pro-
teins, in MS lesions has recently been detected using
Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (134).
Data were obtained with near microscopic resolution,
and revealed that while normal areas of MS white matter
had similar spectra to control white matter, spectra from
within MS lesions indicated an increase in the C=O to
CH2 ratio, suggesting lipid oxidation. Other data were
consistent with the oxidation of proteins (134). The brain
tissue had been fixed in formalin, but control studies sug-
gested that fixation itself did not affect the data obtained.
The failure of an earlier, similar study (40) to detect
changes consistent with oxidative damage was attributed
to earlier technical limitations, and study of chronic inac-
tive plaques rather than the active plaques studied by
LeVine and Wetzel.
Lipid peroxidation can result in the release of a num-
ber of membrane components, including arachidonic
acid. Arachidonic 
acid 
can 
be 
converted 
to
prostaglandins by the enzyme cyclooxygenase and also
to isoprostanes by the non-enzymatic free radical-catal-
ysed peroxidation of arachidonic acid (241). The iso-
prostanes, particularly 8-epi-PGF2a, are used as indica-
tors of oxidative stress (64, 185).  The production of
these pro-inflammatory compounds may evoke further
tissue damage. For example, it appears that prostaglandin
E2 can act in conjunction with ●NO to disrupt the blood
brain barrier (117). A role for oxidant species in barrier
breakdown is supported by the observation that adminis-
tration of a 21-aminosteroid antioxidant (one of a group
of compounds known as “lazaroids”) can attenuate barri-
er disruption induced by arachidonic acid (96). The
prostaglandins are not necessarily damaging to tissues,
however. Administration of a long-acting analogue of
prostaglandin E1 has been found to suppress EAE (182).
The details concerning the effects of ROS on the blood-
brain barrier are the subject of recent reviews (63, 147). 
Other evidence for ROS production. Other evidence
for ROS production in MS has centred on the examina-
tion of blood cells obtained from patients. Studies in
1986 found that the antioxidant enzymes SOD (4) and
glutathione peroxidase (118) were lower in erythrocytes
and haematogenous cells, respectively, of patients than
neurological controls. In keeping with an altered redox
state, it has been found that red cell glutathione peroxi-
dase levels are depressed in MS, with similar reductions
occurring in circulating lymphocytes and granulocytes
(205). Furthermore, stimulated monocytes from patients
with MS were found to produce significantly more
hydrogen peroxide and superoxide than monocytes from
controls (73). The authors concluded that blood mono-
cytes in MS patients are “primed” so that they produce
more ROS than normal when exposed to inflammatory
stimuli. A subsequent study (81) obtained similar results
using whole blood. A finding that red blood cells in
patients with MS displayed increased mechanical fragili-
ty has been attributed to free radical-mediated damage to
lipids in the red cell membranes (37, 198). 
Several studies have examined ROS production in
experimental models of inflammatory demyelinating
disease. A role for hydrogen peroxide was suggested by
findings in actively-induced EAE (93). The evidence
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
77
suggested raised hydrogen peroxide concentrations in
the myelinated portion of the optic nerve in the early
preclinical phase of the disorder when the blood brain
barrier was expected to be initially disturbed. The
authors proposed that the hydrogen peroxide acted both
alone, and through the generation of free radicals in a
cascade of lipid peroxidation and demyelination.
Examining rats with clinical signs of EAE, Ruuls and
colleagues found that macrophages and microglial cells
exhibited significantly higher spontaneous levels of
ROS compared with controls (192). Similarly, and
examining the same model, a later study found signifi-
cantly higher levels of superoxide in all the CNS regions
examined (200). Where superoxide is formed in the
presence of ●NO, the agents combine to form the strong
oxidising and nitrating agent peroxynitrite, and a recent
study found evidence that peroxynitrite is formed very
early during the course of EAE, correlating with disease
activity (235). The labelling was present in
macrophages/microglia, which also showed iNOS reac-
tivity. 
Consequences Of ROS Production. An important
consequence of ROS formation is the promotion of
inflammation via effects on endothelial cells, chemotac-
tic signals and the release of products from the arachi-
donic acid cascade. These effects are beyond the range
of this review, but inflammation can affect the progres-
sion of demyelinating lesions, and perhaps its immuno-
logical consequences. 
Effects Of ROS on Oligodendrocytes. The death of
oligodendrocytes, the central myelinating cell, is an
early event in many demyelinating lesions in MS (33,
176), but the circumstances which cause the death of the
oligodendrocyte remain uncertain. This uncertainty
applies even though MS is believed to be an autoim-
mune disease directed against myelin or the myelinating
cell. There is now evidence that ROS may play a role in
oligodendrocyte death, in addition to the potential role
for ●NO described above. 
Several studies have examined the sensitivity of cul-
tured oligodendrocytes, and their precursors, to damage
by ROS. These studies followed observations by Griot
and colleagues that the demyelination caused in dogs by
infection with the canine distemper virus may be due to
ROS released by brain macrophages (86, 87). The cul-
ture of dog oligodendrocytes in the presence of ROS
generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction (an
experimental system to generate superoxide), revealed
that the oligodendrocytes were killed at ROS concentra-
tions which did not appear to affect astrocytes or brain
macrophages (88). Similar findings were subsequently
made with bovine oligodendrocytes, which could be
completely protected from death by the inclusion in the
medium of catalase, an enzyme which degrades hydro-
gen peroxide to water, but not by the inclusion of the
antioxidants SOD, DMSO, vitamin E or glutathione
(124). The implication that hydrogen peroxide was
responsible for the damage was consistent with findings
from other cultured cell types and was also implicated in
the toxicity of oligodendrocytes, from adult rat brain,
arising from exposure to the catecholamines norepi-
nephrine and epinephrine (165). Catecholamine metab-
olism can generate ROS, including hydrogen peroxide,
and it is significant that the catecholamine toxicity could
be prevented by catalase, and reproduced by the addition
of equimolar concentrations of exogenous hydrogen
peroxide. However, the toxicity is not necessarily due to
hydrogen peroxide directly, even though it is a mild oxi-
dant, since the toxicity may rather be due to the forma-
tion of the highly toxic hydroxyl radical through the
action on hydrogen peroxide of transition metals such as
iron and copper (98): oligodendrocytes are particularly
rich in iron (see below). 
Hydrogen peroxide is also produced in quantity in
peroxisomes (234). Peroxisomes are particularly abun-
dant in oligodendrocytes during the period of active
myelination (5), raising the possibility that oligodendro-
cytes may be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress
during this period. If so, then oligodendrocytes may also
be vulnerable during the repair, by remyelination, of
demyelinating lesions in MS and other demyelinating
disorders (176, 177). In contrast to normal development,
repair by remyelination in MS occurs in the context of
an on-going inflammatory disease involving increased
levels of ROS production. Indeed, repair by remyelina-
tion can be observed in conjunction with on-going
inflammation (181). It is therefore possible that in
response to the combined demands arising from
remyelination and exogenous ROS production, some
oligodendrocytes may undergo degeneration, contribut-
ing to the long term failure of repair by remyelination in
this disease. 
Apart from having a direct effect on oligodendro-
cytes, ROS can also directly affect both the lipid and
protein components of myelin (66, 129). Thus the incu-
bation of myelin with ROS generated in vitro resulted in
lipid peroxidation and the decompaction of myelin
lamellae along the intraperiod line (24). The incubation
also caused the marked peroxidation of myelin basic
protein and proteolipid protein, and this rendered the
proteins susceptible to trypsin degradation (25). It is
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
78
therefore possible that in inflammatory demyelinating
disease, exposure to ROS may render myelin susceptible
to degradation by extracellular proteases, such as those
liberated by macrophages. The decompaction of the
lamellae may also facilitate access of proteases to the
myelin proteins (25). 
An unexpected consequence of ROS/RNS produc-
tion is the release of active matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) from their proenzyme form, via the formation
of either peroxynitrite or the nitrogen dioxide radical
(140). Moreover, hydrogen peroxide exposure has been
found to cause an increase in the mRNA and protein
expression for MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) in cul-
tured human fibroblasts (29). The formation and release
of MMPs may be relevant to demyelination since some
MMPs have been shown to be able to degrade myelin
basic protein (38, 77). Furthermore, inhibitors of MMP
release have been shown to protect animals from both
EAE (52, 76, 103) and EAN (184), the animal models of
MS and GBS respectively. However, the net effect of
RNS formation on MMP activity is difficult to predict
since peroxynitrite has also been found to inhibit some
MMPs (169). 
Demyelination can also follow ischaemic episodes,
or periods of hypoperfusion of the brain. Lesions result-
ing from hypoxic-ischaemic insult typically involve the
grey matter, but delayed white matter lesions are quite
common, and primary demyelination (i.e. myelin loss
with sparing of axons) can result when the insult affects
white matter (78, 79). The consequences of ischaemia
are the subject of another review in this symposium, but
it is appropriate to mention here the occurrence of pri-
mary demyelinating lesions induced in Mongolian ger-
bils by hyperoxia following transient brain ischaemia
(150). This protocol is anticipated to encourage ROS
formation, and it resulted in lesions in the corpus stria-
tum, lateral thalamus, mesencephalon and internal cap-
sule. Lesion formation correlated with the administra-
tion of 100% oxygen following the transient ischaemia.
Delayed primary demyelinating lesions have also been
produced in rats and gerbils with chronic hypoperfusion,
indicating that mild hypoxia, combined with mild hypo-
glycemia, can preferentially affect oligodendrocytes
(101, 239), reviewed in (120). Interestingly, carbon
monoxide exposure results in vivo in an increased pro-
duction of hydroxyl radicals (174), and lipid peroxida-
tion (229), and some patients have been reported to
show a delayed primary demyelination following carbon
monoxide poisoning (78, 79). 
A consequence of ischaemia in grey matter is the
release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Adult rat
oligodendrocytes are much more vulnerable to gluta-
mate-induced cell death than astrocytes (succumbing to
200mM glutamate, whereas astrocytes are resistant to
5mM (166)). However, the extent to which oligodendro-
cytes are exposed to glutamate in demyelinating disease
is uncertain. Examination of CSF from patients with MS
has resulted in reports that glutamate concentrations can
decrease (1, 2, 178), remain unchanged (127), or
increase (221). The increased (221) concentration
occurred in acute MS patients, and consisted of a dou-
bling of glutamate concentration. Serum/plasma gluta-
mate has more consistently been reported to increase in
MS (178), especially during relapses (243). In inflam-
matory MS lesions, glutamate concentrations might rise
since astrocytic glutamate uptake is inhibited by the pro-
inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IFNg and IL-1b, at least
in vitro (255). Glutamate is toxic to cultured oligoden-
drocytes through free radical attack consequent to the
depletion of cystine, and thereby depletion of the antiox-
idant glutathione (166). Glutathione depletion conse-
quent to cystine deprivation also kills cultured oligoden-
drocytes (256). In each case, the cultured oligodendro-
cytes could be protected by the addition of free radical
scavengers, including vitamins C and E. 
Particular Sensitivity of Oligodendrocytes to ROS. A
characteristic of established lesions in MS is the pres-
ence of demyelinated axons embedded among astroglial
processes, with few, if any, oligodendrocytes. A factor
contributing to this appearance may be the much greater
resistance to ROS of astrocytes, in comparison with
oligodendrocytes. It appears that several factors con-
tribute to the comparative sensitivity of oligodendro-
cytes to ROS. For example, recent studies have revealed
that cultured oligodendrocytes at several stages of dif-
ferentiation (proliferative oligodendrocyte progenitor,
proliferative oligodendroblast and mature oligodendro-
cyte) have less than half the glutathione content of astro-
cytes (121, 230). A low level of this important antioxi-
dant is also apparent in vivo (210), and appears to be due
in part to a low rate of glutathione synthesis, and in part
to their having only half the glutathione reductase activ-
ity of astrocytes, and a particularly low level (15% of
astrocytic) of glutathione peroxidase activity (121). In
addition, cultured oligodendrocytes fail to express Mn-
SOD, even when exposed to ROS, in contrast to
microglia and some cultured astrocytes (175).
Furthermore,
immunocytochemical studies have
revealed the absence of metallothionein in oligodendro-
cytes (159, 6), although appreciable quantities are present
in astrocytes (15, 16, 160). Metallothionein is a protein
particularly rich in cysteine (25-30%), making it an effec-
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
79
tive antioxidant and binding agent for zinc and copper
(70). Metallothionein is induced by cytokines, particular-
ly IL-1 (123), and it is expressed at high concentration in
reactive astrocytes in vivo (60, 163). The absence of Mn-
SOD and metallothionein in oligodendrocytes removes
two more avenues of antioxidant defence from this cell. 
A Role For Iron. The increased oxidative risk experi-
enced by oligodendrocytes by virtue of their relative
paucity of antioxidant defence is exacerbated by the fact
that these cells contain most of the iron in the brain (48-
50, 75). It is well known that reduced iron, probably in
low molecular weight complexes such as iron-ADP and
iron-citrate, can promote oxidative damage in vitro by
catalysing the formation of hydroxyl radicals from hydro-
gen peroxide and causing secondary initiation of lipid
peroxidation. Most of the iron in cells is in a ""safe"" form
attached to the binding proteins transferrin and ferritin
(48-50, 75), and in this form it is not available to catalyse
free radical reactions. However, if this iron were to be
released it could catalyse peroxidative chain reactions
that could spread the effects of the injury over a wider
area. It is notable in this regard that superoxide (and other
reducing compounds such as vitamin C) can release iron
ions from ferritin, and that hydrogen peroxide can release
iron 
from 
haemoglobin 
(at 
high 
hydrogen
peroxide:haemoglobin ratios (92)). Thus superoxide and
hydrogen peroxide can create the conditions that lead to
hydroxyl radical production, although the extent to which
this occurs in vivo is not clear. In vitro, it has been demon-
strated that activated microglia can release iron from fer-
ritin, and that the release of iron is mediated through
superoxide production by the microglia since it is blocked
by SOD (257). Interestingly, the oxidative stress experi-
enced by cultured oligodendrocyte precursors when
exposed to blue light (which excites compounds such as
riboflavin ultimately resulting in increased hydrogen per-
oxide production) could be prevented either by chelating
intracellular free iron, or by raising the concentration of
intracellular glutathione to astrocytic levels (230). 
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells appear to be particu-
larly sensitive to ROS in comparison with astrocytes, and
in mixed glial cultures they are preferentially damaged by
measures designed to increase intracellular ROS produc-
tion (112). Preoligodendrocytes also appear to be signifi-
cantly more sensitive than mature oligodendrocytes to
oxidative stress (7). 
Although there is agreement that oligodendrocytes are
more vulnerable to oxidative stress than astrocytes (245),
a recent study found that cultured mouse astrocytes were
“exquisitely sensitive” to oxidative stress, and that their
vulnerability was related to, and enhanced by, iron (187). 
Much of the work cited above was performed in vitro,
with purified cell cultures. Caution is always required
before extrapolating in vitro data to the condition in vivo,
but it is particularly so here since there is evidence that
oligodendrocytes may not be as sensitive to ROS in vivo
as the in vitro data suggest. Thus it has been found that the
inclusion of a monolayer of neonatal rat astrocytes com-
pletely prevented the catecholamine toxicity described
above (165): astrocyte conditioned medium provided no
protection. Also, neurons co-cultured with astrocytes
have markedly elevated concentrations of the antioxidant
glutathione when compared with neurons cultured alone
(20, 194). Oligodendrocytes in vivo may therefore be
more resistant to oxidative stress than the available data
suggest. 
Using histochemical techniques which can detect non-
heam iron, deposits of iron have been found in post-
mortem MS plaques in some cases. For example, using
methods to increase the sensitivity and accessibility of tis-
sue iron to histochemical reagents, iron deposits have
been found to occur frequently in post-mortem MS brain.
The iron is seen in controls and pathological tissues in
both oligodendrocytes and in myelin, but in plaques it is
also present in reactive and amoeboid microglia and in
macrophages (133). In one out of five cases, iron was also
detected in some axons near damaged areas of the white
matter. It appears, therefore, that iron is present at sites
where it could promote oxidative damage in the brains of
patients with MS. 
An early report suggested that actively-induced EAE
could be suppressed by treatment with the iron-chelating
agent desferrioxamine B mesylate (28) see also (94). A
later study found that passively-induced disease could not
be suppressed in this way (244). A potential explanation
for these different findings was that the chelating agent
was actually working by suppressing antigen presentation
in the afferent limb of the autoimmune response (244).
However, a recent finding has found a reduction in clini-
cal signs when animals were treated with desferrioxamine
during the active stage of MBP-induced disease (172).  
Interaction Between Oxidative and Nitrative Stress.
Although the combination of ●NO and superoxide to form
peroxynitrite is well established, it has also been reported
that ●NO can actually reduce superoxide production aris-
ing from the respiratory burst (41, 126). This reduction is
not due to scavenging of the superoxide, but rather to
some other mechanism, which appears not to be mediat-
ed by guanylyl cyclase or cGMP. It has been noted that
the reduction of superoxide generation may serve to limit
the deleterious effects of excessive peroxynitrite forma-
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
80
tion (126). This potentially beneficial effect of ●NO is
counterbalanced by the fact that ●NO can decrease the
activity of some of the enzymes involved in anti-oxidant
defence in cultured oligodendrocyte-like cells. Thus,
although exogenously or endogenously produced ●NO
increased the activity and protein level of Cu/Zn-SOD, it
was found to decrease the activities of the antioxidant
enzymes glutathione peroxidase, catalase and Mn-SOD,
probably through the down regulation of the expression
of their mRNAs (68). ●NO may also inactivate glutathione
peroxidase directly by modifying essential cysteine-like
residues in the enzyme. Such observations indicate that
●NO production may affect the level of oxidative stress
and the effects of ROS production. If ●NO reduces the
antioxidant defence of oligodendrocytes in early inflam-
matory MS lesions, namely a location where the cells will
be exposed to a range of ROS and RNS, it would provide
additional explanation for the loss of these cells and the
formation of a demyelinating lesion.  
Beneficial Effects of ROS and RNS. This review has
focused on the deleterious role of ROS and RNS in pro-
moting demyelinating pathology, but it should be appre-
ciated that these species also serve many beneficial, phys-
iological functions (e.g. ●NO functions as a messenger by
binding to guanylate cyclase) which are beyond the scope
of this review (see (10, 74, 98, 249)). ●NO, in particular,
may also serve beneficial functions under pathological
circumstances. It can, for example, react with organic rad-
icals and it can stop chain radical reactions. Perhaps as a
consequence of such reactions, several experiments have
found that blocking ●NO production in EAE is sometimes
detrimental (see “Antioxidant Therapy” below). Indeed,
●NO is known to exhibit some anti-inflammatory proper-
ties, such as decreasing the proliferation of lymphocytes
in vitro (65), inhibiting the adherence of leukocytes to the
vasculature and infiltration into the tissue (131), and
decreasing IFNg production by Th1 T lymphocytes
(228). Other protective effects of ●NO include protection
from superoxide- or hydrogen peroxide-mediated dam-
age to cells in vitro, perhaps achieved by blocking the for-
mation of hydroxyl radicals (247).
Antioxidant Therapy. As reviewed above, there is
substantial evidence that RNS and ROS are involved in
demyelination, and in demyelinating disease. This evi-
dence has spawned a number of examinations of antiox-
idant and antinitrative therapies, both in vitro and in
vivo, as described below.
We have already mentioned the observation that
oligodendrocytes in vitro are very sensitive to the effects
of ROS, and that they can be protected from ROS- and
catecholamine-induced cell death by the addition of
catalase to degrade hydrogen peroxide (124, 165).
Oligodendrocytes can also be rescued from glutamate-
mediated death by supplementation with cystine or cys-
teine (166). Also, another antioxidant (N-acetyl-L-cys-
teine (NAC), which can effectively raise intracellular
glutathione levels) is able to protect cultured oligoden-
drocytes from toxicity mediated by the pro-inflammato-
ry cytokine TNFa (144): there is evidence that TNF tox-
icity in culture is mediated via ROS (199, 250). Such
observations encourage a belief that antioxidant thera-
pies may be of value in demyelinating diseases such as
MS, and this possibility has been examined in vivo using
animal models. 
Hartung et al. (100) found that early treatment of rats
with the antioxidants catalase or SOD protected against
actively-induced EAN, and that even if treatment was
delayed until after the onset of neurological deficit (i.e.
a clinically relevant regimen) the agents were still effec-
tive in markedly reducing the severity of disease. This
important demonstration that ROS may be involved in
peripheral autoimmune demyelinating disease was fol-
lowed in 1992 by the observation that one of the 21-
aminosteroid antioxidants was effective in reducing the
incidence and severity of actively-induced EAE in the
CNS (95). The administration of catalase before the
onset of neurological deficit was also found to delay the
onset of EAE and to reduce its severity and duration
(192). Furthermore, another antioxidant, butylated
hydroxyanisole, was effective in reducing the incidence,
severity and mortality of passively-induced EAE (99). A
synthetic catalytic scavenger of oxygen radicals, EUK-
8, also ameliorated EAE in mice (141). This evidence
for the involvement of ROS was accompanied in 1994
by the demonstration that RNS may also be involved.
Several investigators have shown that aminoguanidine, a
weak but preferential inhibitor of the inducible/inflam-
matory form of NOS, inhibits the expression of disease
in mice and rats with actively-induced EAE (30, 58,
261) and inhibits demyelination induced by Theiler’s
murine encephalomyelitis virus (189). Also, the use of
antisense knockdown of iNOS in mice has been shown
to inhibit EAE (67). Additional data supporting a view
that decreasing ●NO concentrations may be of therapeu-
tic value have been presented by Hooper et al. (105,
107). These authors found that the inhibition of iNOS
induction (using tricyclodecan-9-xyl-xanthogenate), or
scavenging of ●NO (using 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetram-
ethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide) 
or 
peroxynitrite
(using uric acid), inhibited neurological disease in mice
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
81
with actively-induced EAE. Withdrawal of the iNOS
inhibitor resulted in the expression of neurological signs
within 24 hours. 
The evidence described above provides a seemingly
unambiguous argument for the value of antioxidant ther-
apy in inflammatory demyelinating disease. However,
data reported in 1995/6 (193, 262) suggested that the
inhibition of nitric oxide production is not always bene-
ficial, and the most recent data (54) indicates that such
inhibition can be lethal. Zielasek and colleagues (262)
used several inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, namely
NG-L-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA), which is rela-
tively non-specific for different NOS isozymes,
aminoguanidine, which is relatively selective for the
inducible form of NOS, and two other inhibitors. They
examined the effects of these inhibitors in different
models of experimental autoimmune disease. L-NMMA
partially suppressed passively-induced EAN (i.e. EAN
induced by the injection of neuritogenic T-cells), but not
actively-induced EAN or passively-induced EAE.
Aminoguanidine enhanced actively-induced EAE, and
had no significant effects on actively-induced EAN. The
other NOS inhibitors had little or no effects in EAN and
EAE. As the authors noted, the diversity of action indi-
cates that the ●NO pathway may play a more complex
role in disease than previously suggested. Ruuls et al.
(193) found that the NOS inhibitors N(omega)-nitro-L-
arginine and N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine, exacerbated
actively-induced EAE. Another study (54) also found
that NOS inhibition, by aminoguanidine, exacerbated
actively-induced EAE. Other recent data has revealed
that iNOS knockout mice have more severe EAE (72,
195). Indeed, the complexity was highlighted further by
the observation that another NOS inhibitor, N-methy-L-
arginine (NMA), could induce disease in PVG rats
which are normally resistant to actively-induced EAE
(54). The disease in PVG rats was fulminating in nature,
and accompanied by some mortality. Interestingly, in
the absence of NOS inhibition, PVG rats were found to
develop higher serum nitrite and nitrate levels (surrogate
markers of ●NO production) than did Lewis rats, even
though Lewis rats are susceptible to EAE. This data sug-
gested that ●NO may actually protect PVG rats from dis-
ease, and additional in vitro data indicate that this pro-
tection may be due to the inhibition by ●NO of T cell
proliferation (54). 
A role for antioxidants in MS has been suggested by
many authors e.g. (51, 113, 242), but no large scale tri-
als have been conducted. However, therapy with IFNb
has been shown to reduce the relapse rate and possibly
clinical progression (97, 191). It is often proposed that
IFNb produces its beneficial effects by mechanisms
involving immune modulation. However, it has recently
been realised that IFNb also impairs the ability of astro-
cytes in vitro to form iNOS in response to inflammatory
stimuli, such as exposure to the cytokines IL-1b and
IFNg (90, 109, 218, 219). IFNb also downregulates the
level of steady state expression of iNOS in cultured
astrocytes (109). These observations raise the possibili-
ty that, in part at least, IFNb may effectively be func-
tioning in MS as a component of the antioxidant
defence. If so, then other therapies based on this strate-
gy may also be beneficial. The role of nitric oxide in MS
has been examined in a recent review (171). 
The variable observations obtained with the use of
NOS inhibitors in experimental autoimmune demyeli-
nating disease may be related to the relative lack of
potency and specificity of the inhibitors, or to inoppor-
tune timing of the therapy in the course of the disease:
●NO has immune regulatory effects as well as cytotoxic
ones (see above), and so the timing of administration
could be critical. Theory suggests that if ●NO inhibition
can be an effective therapy for MS, an ideal ●NO
inhibitor would be one which was specific for iNOS,
since this would leave the eNOS and nNOS enzymes
unaffected, permitting normal physiological function to
continue. [However, it may be worth mentioning evi-
dence that iNOS can be induced in response to non-
inflammatory, non-immunologic, or inapparent stimuli,
and so even a specific inhibitor may have unwanted
“side” effects (see discussion in (161)).] When such an
inhibitor is discovered it will be interesting to consider
whether it may best be employed in conjunction with
neurotrophic therapy. Evidence has recently been
advanced suggesting that at least one of the neu-
rotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
limits its own neuroprotective potential by inducing
NOS, and thereby damaging ●NO production (128) see
also (144). The data showed that whereas neither BDNF
nor a free radical inhibitor (either the spin trap S-PBN or
the NOS inhibitor L-NAME) effected significant sur-
vival of retinal ganglion cells from axotomy-induced
death, the agents acted synergistically upon co-adminis-
tration to rescue significant numbers of RGCs. 
Hyperbaric oxygen has been advanced as a therapy in
MS following positive findings in EAE (240). Clinical
trials have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect
(125), but the findings in EAE remain unexplained. It
has been reported (4) that exposure of MS patients to
hyperbaric oxygen resulted in a significant increase in
erythrocyte SOD levels, indicating an increase in cellu-
lar oxidative defence. It seems likely that the exposure
K.J. Smith et al: Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Demyelination
82
to hyperbaric oxygen resulted in an increase in superox-
ide, and that this induced the formation of oxidative
stress enzymes. If such enzymes were also induced in
CNS cells, it would increase the tolerance of the cells to
oxidative stress and this could help to explain the bene-
ficial effects in animals (242). 
Future Therapy of MS and GBS from an antioxi-
dant perspective. It seems likely that peroxynitrite, or
one of its derivatives, plays a role in the development of
MS lesions, given the presence of nitrotyrosine labelling
within lesions (56, 57, 235). This view is supported by
the efficacy of a trial therapy based on peroxynitrite
scavenging using uric acid (105, 107) (although uric
acid actually scavenges several reactive species, not just
peroxynitrite). Since peroxynitrite is formed by the
combination of superoxide and ●NO, peroxynitrite for-
mation can be diminished by inhibiting the production
of either of these molecules: it is not necessary to inhib-
it both. Indeed, strategies aimed at reducing the forma-
tion of either molecule have produced beneficial effects
in EAE (30, 58, 67, 95, 99, 100, 105, 107, 141, 192,
261). It is too early to state with any certainty whether
superoxide or ●NO (if either) will form the best target for
new therapies in human demyelinating disease. Current
electrophysiological evidence from our laboratory
shows that exposure to ●NO donors can promote con-
duction block (183) and axonal degeneration (213), and
such observations appear to recommend therapeutic
strategies based on decreasing the concentration of ●NO.
However, the effector molecule (whether ●NO, perox-
ynitrite or another ●NO derivative) in the electrophysio-
logical experiments is not yet clear. Furthermore, thera-
pies designed to decrease ●NO concentrations (54, 72,
193, 195, 262) have been less consistently beneficial in
experimental demyelinating disease than those designed
to limit superoxide. This latter consideration favours the
development of strategies to inhibit extracellular super-
oxide formation within lesions. Such strategies may also
limit the formation of hydrogen peroxide, a molecule
which appears to be quite toxic to oligodendrocytes
(124, 165). The pace of research into the roles of ROS
and RNS in demyelination is accelerating rapidly, and
the optimal strategy may soon become clearer.

Summary Many patients undergoing surgery for gastric carcinoma will develop peritoneal metastases. A method to identify those patients at
risk of peritoneal recurrence would help in the selection of patients for adjuvant therapy. Peritoneal cytology has received little attention in the
West, but may prove a useful additional means of evaluating patients with gastric cancer. The aims of this study were to evaluate sampling
techniques for peritoneal cytology in patients with gastric cancer, to assess the prognostic significance of free peritoneal malignant cells and
to discover the effect of the operative procedure on dissemination of malignant cells. The study is based on 85 consecutive patients
undergoing surgical treatment of gastric cancer and followed up for 2 years or until death. Peritoneal cytology samples were collected at
laparoscopy, and at operation prior to resection by intraperitoneal lavage and serosal brushings. After resection, samples were taken by
peritoneal lavage, imprint cytology of the resected specimen and post-operatively by peritoneal irrigation via a percutaneous catheter.
Malignant cells were diagnosed by two independent microscopists. Preoperative peritoneal lavage yielded malignant cells in 16 out of 85
cases (19%). The yield of free malignant cells was increased by using serosal brushings (by four cases) and imprint cytology (by two cases);
all of the cases had evidence of serosal penetration. One serosa-negative case exhibited positive cytology in the post-resection peritoneal
specimen in which the preresection cytology specimen was negative. Survival was worse in the cytology-positive group (χ2 = 25.1; P <
0.0001). Among serosa-positive patients, survival was significantly reduced if cytology was positive, if cases yielded by brushings and imprint
cytology were included (log-rank test = 8.44; 1 df, P = 0.004). In conclusion, free peritoneal malignant cells can be identified in patients with
gastric cancer who have a poor prognosis; the yield can be increased with brushings and imprint cytology in addition to conventional
peritoneal lavage. Evaluation of peritoneal cytology by these methods may have a role in the selection of patients with the poorest prognosis
who may benefit most from adjuvant therapy.

*χ2 = 19.89; 3 d.f., P < 0.001; **χ2 = 1.77; 2 d.f., P = n/s (discrepancy with
incidence of lymph node metastases described in operative findings suggest,
overall, one case was over-staged by surgeon); *** χ2 = 10.35; 1 d.f.,
P = <0.01 (discrepancy with incidence of metastases described in operative
findings suggest, overall, three cases were over-staged by surgeon). aOne
patient had no serosal breach; cytology was negative before, but positive

Summary Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) catabolism. We report
lymphocytic DPD data concerning a group of 53 patients (23 men, 30 women, mean age 58, range 36–73), treated by 5-FU-based
chemotherapy in different French institutions and who developed unanticipated 5-FU-related toxicity. Lymphocyte samples (standard
collection procedure) were sent to us for DPD determination (biochemical method). Among the whole group of 53 patients, 19 had a
significant DPD deficiency (DD; below 150 fmol min–1 mg–1 protein, i.e. less than 70% of the mean value observed from previous population
study). There was a greater majority of women in the DD group (15 out of 19, 79%) compared with the remaining 34 patients (15 out of 34,
44%, P<0.014). Toxicity was often severe, leading to patient death in two cases (both women). The toxicity score (sum of WHO grading,
theoritical range 0–20) was twice as high in patients with marked DD (below 100 pmol min–1 mg–1 protein, n = 11, mean score = 13.2)
compared with patients with moderate DD (between 150 and 100 pmol min–1 mg–1 protein, n = 8, mean score = 6.8), P = 0.008. In the DD
group, there was a high frequency of neurotoxic syndromes (7 out of 19, 37%). The two deceased patients both had severe neurotoxicity. The
occurrence of cardiac toxicity was relatively rare (1 out of 19, 5%). These data suggest that women are particularly prone to DPD deficiency
and allow a more precise definition of the DD toxicity profile.

Summary. A reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting a 407 bp fragment
of the nucleocapsid gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was developed for detec-
tion of BCV RNA in feces of experimentally inoculated cattle. The sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of the RT-PCR were conﬁrmed using tissue culture-adapted BCV
strains and feces of 2 calves inoculated with BCV. Ten nonpregant, BCV seropos-
itive, adult dairy cows were inoculated with winter dysentery (WD) (n = 8) or calf
diarrhea (CD) (n = 2) strains of BCV intranasally and orally (n = 2) or through
a surgically-placed duodenal catheter (n = 8) with and without dexamethasone
treatment or feeding ice water. The 6 cows inoculated with BCV intranasally and
through a duodenal catheter (2 of 2 cows given CD BCV and 4 of 6 cows given
WD BCV) developed mild diarrhea, and BCV was detected in diarrheal feces by
RT-PCR, ELISA or immune electron microscopy. These results suggest that CD
and WD strains of BCV can cause diarrhea in adult cows in conjunction with
host or environmental factors and that RT-PCR might be useful to diagnose BCV
infections in calves and adult cows.

Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is an important pathogen of neonatal calf diarrhea
(CD) [5]. The virus also has been isolated from adult cattle experiencing acute di-
arrhea during outbreaks of winter dysentery (WD) [19]. In a recent study individ-

uals in herds experiencing WD were more likely to have recently seroresponded
to BCV than individuals in non-affected herds [22]. However, the role of BCV in
the WD syndrome remains unclear. A few attempts were made to experimentally
reproduce WD in cows using feces from cows with WD as challenge inocula, but
results have been inconsistent [3, 28]. Certain risk factors combined with BCV
infection might be important to initiate WD [22].
Antigenic, biological and genomic variations among BCV strains have been
reported [9, 13]. Recently, we also detected some antigenic and biological diver-
sity among BCV strains, but these variations were unrelated to the clinical source
of the strains; i.e. CD or WD [26]. Also we reported complete cross-protection
and no differences in the pathogenicity between selected WD and CD BCV strains
in experimentally infected gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves [10]. How-
ever, the infectivity and pathogenicity of CD and WD BCV for adult cows is
unclear. Electron microscopy (EM) is often used for the identiﬁcation of BCV in
feces [2, 6]. However, sometimes it is difﬁcult to identify BCV in feces by EM
because pleomorphic membranous particles resembling coronaviruses are com-
mon in feces [19]. Nucleic acid based assays, especially PCR, have been used to
detect enteric viruses [4, 14, 31].
The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop RT-PCR for the detection of
BCV in feces; and 2) to attempt to experimentally reproduce WD in adult cows
with CD and WD strains of BCV and to detect BCV in feces of these cows by
RT-PCR.
The live virulent WD DBA and CD DB2 and 216XF strains of BCV were used
in this study [1, 26]. These strains were passaged in gnotobiotic calves (DBA and
DB2) at leat 5 times or in colostrum-deprived calves (216XF) 2 times, and the
large intestinal contents of the infected calves were harvested as inocula for this
study. Electron microscopic examination of the inocula revealed the presence of
BCV and no adventitious viruses. The following viruses were used for RT-PCR:
Six strains (Mebus, DB2, 216XF, OHC, SDC and JAZ) of CD BCV [1, 26]; 8
strains (DBA, SD, CN, BE, AW, TS, BM and BW) of WD BCV [1, 26]; 2 deer
coronavirus strains (KI-D2 and WTD) propagated in HRT-18 cells [25]; 3 group
A rotavirus strains (NCDV Lincoln, Gottfried and OSU) propagated in MA104
cells; and a transmissible gastroenteritis virus strain (Purdue, P115) propagated
in ST cells.
A total of 11 nonpregnant, nonlactating, adult, Hostein dairy cows (3 to 5 years
of age) were used. Ten of these were inoculated with BCV and the remaining one
was a non-inoculated control. These cows were housed separately in an infectious
disease isolation facility, where temperature was controlled at about 20 ◦C, and
hay and concentrate were fed during the experiments. These cows possessed
antibodies to BCV by previous natural infection before challenge, and BCV was
notdetectedfromdailyfecesbyELISAandimmuneelectronmicroscopy(IEM)at
leat 1 week prior to the start of the experiments. A 20% suspension of the intestinal
contents containing the DBA, DB2 or 216XF strain of BCV was administered
using 10 ml intranasally and 90 ml through a surgically-placed duodenal catheter
(Supraﬂex Trocar Catheter; Rusch Inc) (8 cows) or alternatively, given orally

(2 cows) (Table 1). The surgery on the duodenal catheter was done at least 1 week
before the experiments. Six cows received serial injections of dexamethasone
(Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation) (DM; 50 mg/day) intramuscularly
for 5 days prior to or after BCV challenge (Table 1). Forty liters of ice water were
given to 2 cows through an intranasal catheter 2 times in the previous day and on
the day of challenge. After inoculation of cows with BCV, feces and nasal swab
specimens were collected daily, blood samples were collected at challenge and
14 to 21 days later, and clinical signs were observed through post-inoculation
days (PID) 14 to 21 except for one cow (cow 5) euthanized at PID 4. One non-
inoculated control cow (cow 11) received serial injections of DM (50 mg/day) for
5 days and 40 liters of ice water for 2 days at the last day of DM treatment and for
the next day. Feces and nasal swab specimens were collected from this cow for
19 days from the ﬁrst day of DM treatment, blood samples were collected at the
last day of DM treatment and 14 days later, and clinical signs were observed for
19 days from the ﬁrst day of DM treatment. Feces were diluted 1:10 in 10 mM
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) for ELISA and IEM and 1:2 for RT-
PCR. Nasal epithelial cells were collected from nasal swab specimens and were
used for direct immunoﬂuorescence (IF) tests. One colostrum-deprived calf (28-
day-old) and a gnotobiotic calf (7-day-old) were inoculated oronasally with the
DB2 and DBA strains of BCV, respectively. Feces were collected for 14 days and
examined for BCV by ELISA, IEM and RT-PCR.
Fecal suspensions were processed and examined by IEM as described pre-
viously [20]. An ELISA using monoclonal antibodies to BCV for the detection
of BCV antigen was conducted on the fecal samples as described previously
[24]. Direct IF tests were performed with nasal epithelial cells using ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-BCV (Mebus strain) serum [21]. Virus
neutralization (VN) tests were conducted using HRT-18 cells as described previ-
ously [27]. Seroconversion was deﬁned as a 4-fold or greater increase in serum
antibody titers to BCV at 14 to 21 days after inoculation compared with those at
inoculation.
An RT-PCR assay for detection of BCV was performed as follows. Viral
RNA was extracted from 0.2 ml of each fecal suspension and puriﬁed BCV
(Mebus strain) using a Micro RNA isolation kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems),
based on the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform RNA extraction method. The
tissue culture-adapted viruses were used directly without RNA extraction. The
primers for BCV were designed from the published sequence of the nucleocapsid
gene of the Mebus strain [12]. The sequences of primers (positions calculated
from the start codon of the nucleocapsid gene) were as follows: upstream primer
5′-GCCGATCAGTCCGACCAATC-3 (position, 92–111); downstream primer,
5′-AGAATGTCAGCCGGGGTAT-3′ (position, 498–480). The predicted PCR
product was 407 base pairs. The reverse transcriptase reaction was conducted
by the following procedure. In the tube, 5 ml of RNA sample was added to 2 ml
of the downstream primer (50 pmol) and 4 ml of water. The tube was incubated
at 100 ◦C for 2 min and then quenched on ice for 5 min. Subsequently, 4 ml of
5 × RT buffer [250 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2], 2 ml of

0.1 M dithiothereitol, 2 ml of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 ml of RNAsin (Promega Corpo-
ration), and 0.5 ml of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Gibco BRL Products)
(200 U/ml) were added and incubated at 37 ◦C for 60 min. Then 5 ml of the RT
reaction samples were added to 95 ml of the PCR mixture. The PCR mixture con-
sisted of 10 ml of 10 × PCR buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 500 mM KCl,
15 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin], 2 ml of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 ml of the upstream primer
(50 pmol), 1 ml of the downstream primer (50 pmol), 80.5 ml of water and 0.5 ml
of Taq polymerase (Promega Corporation) (5 U/ml). The mixture was overlaid
with mineral oil and then subjected to 4 min of preheating at 94 ◦C, 30 cycles of
1 min at 94 ◦C, 1 min at 58 ◦C, 2 min at 72 ◦C, and a ﬁnal 7 min incubation at
72 ◦C. The PCR products were visualized on 1.2% agarose gels stained with ethid-
ium bromide. Ten virus-negative feces collected from preexposure gnotobiotic or
colostrum-deprived calves were used as negative controls.
PCR products of 407 bp were found after RT-PCR with all 14 BCV and 2
deer coronavirus strains. By contrast, rotaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis
virus and all 10 virus negative fecal samples were negative in the assay. As little
as 1 pg of puriﬁed BCV (Mebus strain) RNA and 0.1 TCID50 of BCV (Mebus
strain)-infected HRT-18 cell culture ﬂuids could be detected in this assay. Fecal
shedding of BCV by 2 calves was detected after inoculation by the RT-PCR for 8
days, whereas BCV was detected by IEM and ELISA for 4–5 days and 5–7 days,
respectively.
Cows 1 and 2 inoculated oronasally with the WD BCV did not show clinical
signs of BCV infection (Table 1). Therefore, other cows were inoculated through
a duodenal catheter with and without DM or ice water. Cow 3, inoculated with a
CD BCV, developed diarrhea from PID 4. The virus was detected in feces by IEM
and ELISA from PID 4 for 3 days, and the RT-PCR showed positive reactions
from PID 3 for 5 days (Fig. 1). Seroconversion was observed at 2 weeks after
inoculation (Table 1). Cow 4 inoculated with WD BCV did not develop diarrhea
through PID 12, but the virus was detected in the feces at PID 3 and in nasal
epithelial cells at PID 5 and 6. At PID 12, this cow received serial injections
of DM for 5 days. From the 5th day of DM treatment, she exhibited diarrhea
for 2 days. The virus was detected by ELISA and IEM from the 5th day of
DM treatment for 2 days, and RT-PCR showed positive reactions from the 4th

day of DM treatment for 3 days. Seroconversion was observed at 3 weeks after
inoculation (Table 1). Cows 5, 6, 7 and 8 were treated with DM daily for 5 days
prior to inoculation with the WD BCV (cows 5, 7, 8) or CD BCV (cow 6). Cows 5
and 6 developed diarrhea from 3 and 6 PID, respectively. The feces of cows 5 and
6 were positive for BCV by all detection methods, and by IEM and RT-PCR from
the day diarrhea commenced. In contrast, cows 7 and 8 did not develop diarrhea,
and BCV shedding was not detected in feces, although seroconversion to BCV
was observed in cow 8 (Table 1). Cows 9 and 10 were given ice water daily for 2
days and cow 10 was also treated with DM for 5 days prior to challenge with the
WD BCV. Cows 9 and 10 developed diarrhea on PID 8 for 6 days or on PID 3
for 5 days, respectively. The feces of cow 9 were positive for BCV from the day
diarrhea began for 3 days by all detection methods. The feces of cow 10 were
positiveforBCVfromtheonsetofdiarrheathrough4daysbyELISAandIEM,but
negative by RT-PCR. Seroconversion to BCV was not observed in these 2 cows
(Table 1). Cow 11, non-inoculated, but treated with dexamethasone and given
ice water, showed neither clinical signs of BCV infection, BCV shedding, nor
seroconversion (Table 1). All diarrheal feces of the cows were black, semiliquid,
and no cow showed bloody diarrhea, fever, or respiratory symptoms.
Recently, an RT-PCR method was reported for the detection of human coro-
naviruses from nasal aspirates [15], but to our knowledge there are no reports
of the diagnosis of BCV in feces by RT-PCR. We designed primers from the
nucleocapsid gene because this gene is conserved among BCV strains [8]. All
14 stains of BCV including the DBA, DB2 and 216XF which were used for cow
inoculations, and the deer coronaviruses were detected by RT-PCR, suggesting
that the sequences of the primers used in this study were conserved among these
BCV strains. The RT-PCR was more sensitive than ELISA and IEM to detect
BCV in the feces of experimentally inoculated calves. For the majority of feces
from the cows, samples positive by ELISA or IEM were also positive by RT-PCR.
These results indicated that the RT-PCR developed might be useful for diagnosis
of BCV infections in calves and adult cows. However, the feces of cow 10 at
PID 3 to 6 were positive for BCV by ELISA and IEM, but not by RT-PCR. These
negative results might be caused by the presence of inhibitory substances for PCR
present in the feces of this animal [30].
Several risk factors for WD have been reported [3, 19, 22, 23, 29]. Especially,
stress factors, such as dietary changes, parturition, lactation, chilling due to low
environmental temperature or cold drinking water, or wide ﬂuctuations in tem-
peratures might play an important role in initiating the disease. Also, the immune
status of cows [23] and mixed infections of BCV with other microorganisms
might be contributory factors to the disease. At ﬁrst, we tried to inoculate the
virus oronasally to 2 cows, as was done previously for gnotobiotic or colostrum-
deprivedcalves[10],butthesecowsdidnotshowanyclinicalsigns,virusshedding
or increased serum antibody responses to BCV. These results indicate that un-
like in calves [10], it is difﬁcult to reproduce diarrhea in seropositive adult cows
challenged with BCV via the oronasal route. In contrast, 6 of 8 cows inoculated
through a duodenal catheter developed diarrhea and shed BCV in diarrheal feces.

Viral inoculation via the duodenum excluded the adverse effects of rumen micro-
organisms and gastric acids in the abomasum on BCV. Certain stress factors,
such as mentioned previously, may change the number and composition of
rumen microorganisms, or increase the pH of the abomasum and inﬂuence BCV
infectivity in the ﬁeld. Immune suppression induced by DM treatment inﬂuenced
the occurrence of diarrhea and virus shedding in our BCV challenge exposure
studies, although exceptions occurred. For example, cow 4 began to show diarrhea
and virus shedding during DM treatment. The DM treatment causes deleterious
effects on mucosal immune responses as reported previously [16, 18] and likely
also compromises mucosal immune responses and host resistance to BCV. We
gave a large volume of ice water to 2 cows as a stress inducer before inoculation
and one of them was also treated with DM before inoculation. Both cows showed
diarrhea and virus shedding, but there were no major differences between the 2
cows in the degree of diarrhea and the duration of virus shedding. However it was
interesting that ice water treatment alone in cow 9 also resulted in BCV infection
and diarrhea.
Chronic shedding of BCV in the feces of clinically normal cows has been
reported [7], but no BCV was detected in feces from these cows for at least 1
week prior to the start of these experiments. Also, one non-inoculated control
cow, which was treated with dexamethasone and given ice water, did not show
BCV shedding or diarrhea. Therefore, there is a low possibility that the BCV
detected in the feces of cows after inoculation was endogenous BCV.
Pre-existing serum VN antibody titers to BCV did not protect cows against
BCV infections in this study. No obvious agreement was evident between the
antibody titer and the degree of protection. For example, the antibody titer of cow
7 was low at challenge (320), and this cow did not show any clinical signs of BCV
infection. In contrast, cow 9 had a hight serum antibody titer (2 560) at challenge,
but developed diarrhea and shed virus. Most adult dairy cattle are seropositive
to BCV [19, 22]. Further analysis of intestinal antibody titers to BCV in cows is
needed to help clarify whether they are an indicator of protection [11]. Diarrhea in
this cow-challenge exposure model was mild, and no bloody feces were observed.
Further studies are needed to determine other signiﬁcant risk factors to reproduce
WD, in particular the bloody diarrhea sometimes observed in a percentage of the
affected cows [19].
Bovine coronavirus causes neonatal CD and is also detected from adult cattle
with WD. Based on epidemiological data, these disease syndromes often occur
as separate and distinct outbreaks in herds; therefore differences in pathogenic-
ity and antigenicity between CD and WD BCV might be expected [9, 13, 19].
However, isolates of WD BCV were reported to produce bloody diarrhea [17]
or watery diarrhea [10] in newborn calves. Our previous results indicated that
the degree of diarrhea and the patterns of fecal and nasal shedding of BCV were
indistinguishable between the CD DB2 and WD DBA strains based on cross-
protection studies in calves [10], suggesting that WD BCV strains cause diarrhea
in calves. Also, there were no relationships between the antigenic and biological
diversity among BCV strains and the clinical sources (WD and CD) of the strains
174
H. Tsunemitsu et al.
[26]. In this study, 2 of 2 cows inoculated with the DB2 or 216XF strain of CD
BCV, and 4 of 6 cows inoculated with the DBA strain of WD BCV via a doudenal
catheter developed diarrhea and shed virus. These results suggest that CD and WD
BCV can cause diarrhea in adult cows in combination with host or environmental
factors, and these factors might contribute to the separate and distinct nature of
the WD and CD outbreaks.

Outbreaks of Streptococcus pneumoniae
(antibiotic resistant and nonresistant) have been
reported from child-care centers, nursing homes,
hospitals, military camps, homeless shelters,
and penal institutions (1-6). Simultaneous cases
within households have rarely been reported
(7-11); such cases require common exposure and
transmission, as well as similar likelihood of
disease in the hosts or increased virulence in the
pathogen.
In December 1996 and January 1997, three
married 
couples 
with 
multidrug-resistant
S. pneumoniae (MDRSP) were admitted to
Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary. The couples
were not admitted on the same day. None of the
couples lived with children, although couple C
had daily contact with children. All patients
received appropriate antibiotic therapy after
their culture and antibiotic sensitivity results
were known. We reviewed each patients health
record (Table) and were able to contact two of the
three couples for further information.
S. pneumoniae were identified by standard
methods. MICs were determined by E-Test (AB
Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and classified as
susceptible (S), intermediate resistant (I), or
fully resistant (R) to each antibiotic, according to
National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards 
guidelines 
(12). 
Serotyping 
of
S. pneumoniae was performed by the Quellung
reaction technique at the National Centre for
Streptococcus, Edmonton. Electrophoretic fin-
gerprinting of S. pneumoniae was performed by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of DNA
digested with Sma1 (BRL, Gaithersburg, MD).
The PFGE patterns were classified as indistin-
guishable, related, or different according to
criteria suggested by Tenover (13).
The diagnosis of S. pneumoniae pneumonia
in couple A was confirmed by positive blood
cultures, chest X-ray lobar pneumonia, and
disease-compatible clinical findings. Patient 1 in
couple A was a health records clerk at Foothills
Medical Centre. Her illness was complicated
soon after admission by empyema, which was
drained; the fluid was S. pneumoniae-negative.
Vertebral osteomyelitis was suspected from
clinical evidence 18 days after admission and was
confirmed by bone scan; no diagnostic culture
was obtained. Osteomyelitis in this patient was
presumably caused by S. pneumoniae. The
initial 7-day course of cefuroxime (to which
S. pneumoniae was resistant) may not have
cleared the infection and thus allowed secondary
seeding to bone.

Proven or presumptive multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia
was diagnosed simultaneously in three married couples in Alberta, Canada. The pair of
isolates from each couple had identical antibiotic resistance profiles, serotypes, and
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. One or more of these cases could have been
prevented by S. pneumoniae vaccine.

Couple B (who could not be reached for
further information) had had recent visitors
from Texas (one a hospital worker) with upper
respiratory tract infections. S. pneumoniae
pneumonia was presumptively diagnosed in this
couple on the basis of symptoms, signs, and chest
X-rays 
compatible 
with 
the 
diagnosis 
of
pneumonia, as well as sputum samples, which
had gram-positive lancet-shaped cocci identified
on Gram stain and grew S. pneumoniae. From
the sputum of patient 2 in couple B, gram-
negative bacilli were identified on Gram stain;
Haemophilus influenzae was also isolated. Thus,
this patient may have been coinfected, or
primarily infected, with H. influenzae. The
patients blood cultures were negative; a blood
culture was not performed on patient 1 in couple B.
Couple C was admitted with severe burns
and inhalation injuries after the stove in their
two-room trailer exploded. They had had
recurrent 
sinusitis 
and 
other 
respiratory
infections in the previous year since moving to
their trailer, which had poor air circulation.
Patient 1 of this couple was taking antibiotics at
the time of admission, and patient 2 had recently
completed a course of antibiotics. The diagnosis
of pneumonia (patient 1 on day 3 of admission
and patient 2 on day 2) was made on the basis of
recent upper respiratory symptoms and fever,
diminished breath sounds, crepitations, and
disease-compatible chest X-ray findings (previ-
ous films had been normal), which made
pneumonia more likely than noninfectious
conditions such as acute lung syndrome. The
presumptive diagnosis of S. pneumoniae as the
etiologic agent in the case of patient 1, couple C,
was made on the basis of the initial endotracheal
tube aspirate, which had gram-positive lancet-
shaped cocci identified on Gram stain and grew
S. pneumoniae. Only gram-positive lancet-
shaped cocci were identified from the initial
bronchoalveolar lavage of patient 2 on Gram
stain, and S. pneumoniae grew in much greater
numbers than H. influenzae. Blood cultures,
performed for couple C only after antibiotic
therapy was started, were negative. Patient 2
died of septic shock 20 days after admission, with
Candida albicans in his blood. The bronchop-
neumonia never resolved clinically, although
S. pneumoniae was not isolated from any further
cultures. Thus, S. pneumoniae may have been a
contributing factor to, but not likely the direct
cause, of this patients death.
The identical susceptibility patterns, sero-
types, and PFGE patterns indicate that both
partners in each couple were infected with the
same multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae strain.
Couples A and B apparently had community-
acquired pneumonia. Although couple C con-
tracted pneumonia 48 to 72 hours after
admission, each partner entered the hospital
already infected with MDRSP; the infecting
organisms 
were 
identical, 
and 
no 
other
recognized cases of nosocomial MDRSP occurred
at Foothills Medical Centre at the time of their
admission (they were admitted 1 month before
couple B, who were also infected with serotype
9V MDRSP). Couple A may have been exposed to
MDRSP as a result of one partners work in a
tertiary-care hospital; couple B as a result of one
partners exposure to a health-care worker with
respiratory symptoms. At the time of these cases,
the 
prevalence 
of 
penicillin-nonsusceptible
S. pneumoniae infections in Calgary was
approximately 10% (A.P. Gibb, unpub. data).
None 
of 
these 
patients 
had 
received
S. pneumoniae vaccine, yet each had one or more
risk factors for infection (advanced age, exposure
to young children, smoking, and chronic lung or
heart disease). Couple C had a history of recent
antibiotic use, the predominant risk factor for
antibiotic-resistant infections.
In Canada, the S. pneumoniae vaccine is
recommended for all persons ≥65 years old and
persons ≥2 years with identified risk factors (14).
Despite the vaccines reasonable effectiveness,
its use has been very low in Canada until
recently (fewer than 12 doses per 10,000
population distributed annually [15,16]). The
vaccine has been provided free of charge to
persons with medical indications, but not to
healthy persons 65 years of age and older and not
as part of a routine vaccination schedule (17).
Some provinces (including Alberta, beginning in
1998) have begun to routinely provide the
vaccine to all persons at risk. The current
incidence of invasive S. pneumoniae infections in
Calgary is 20 per 100,000 per year overall and 87
per 100,000 per year in those older than 64 years
of age (J.D. Klein, unpub. data).
Outbreaks of S. pneumoniae disease occur in
institutions with crowding, poor air quality, or
increased host susceptibility (2,4,6). These
factors may also exist within households (9,11).
Couple C, for example, lived in a very crowded
space with poor air circulation.

The rate at which secondary S. pneumoniae
infections occur in household contacts of index
patients with invasive disease is not known, but
rare cases have been reported (7-11). Factors
contributing to secondary infections include the
likelihood of nasopharyngeal infection due to
exposure to the index patient or a common
source, susceptibility to the strain of the index
infection, and likelihood that colonization will
lead to disease rather than to development of
asymptomatic immunity. Data on contempora-
neous nasopharyngeal carriage of the outbreak
strain by household contacts are limited. A
recent study from Gambia found carriage in 8.5%
of household contacts, compared with 21% in an
older U.S. study (18,19). In healthy adults, the
prevalence of circulating S. pneumoniae antibod-
ies is low (4% to 34%, depending on the serotype);
however, two thirds of adults have protective
antibody within 1 month of colonization (20).
Approximately 15% of children who acquire a
new S. pneumoniae strain nasopharyngeally in a
nonoutbreak setting acquire clinical disease
(usually otitis media); this rate is unknown for
adults (21). In contrast, during a recent nursing-
home pneumonia outbreak, 23% of residents
were infected with the S. pneumoniae outbreak
strain, and 4% became ill (22). The median age of
residents was 85 years; only 4% had received
S. pneumoniae vaccine.
Increased use of S. pneumoniae vaccine
may prevent MDRSP pneumonia within
households and among persons living in
crowded conditions.

The P190, P210, and P230 Forms of the BCR/ABL 
Oncogene Induce a Similar Chronic Myeloid Leukemia–like 
Syndrome in Mice but Have Different Lymphoid 
Leukemogenic Activity

Summary
The product of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation, the BCR/ABL oncogene, exists
in three principal forms (P190, P210, and P230 BCR/ABL) that are found in distinct forms of
Ph-positive leukemia, suggesting the three proteins have different leukemogenic activity. We
have directly compared the tyrosine kinase activity, in vitro transformation properties, and in vivo
leukemogenic activity of the P190, P210, and P230 forms of BCR/ABL. P230 exhibited lower
intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity than P210 and P190. Although all three oncogenes transformed
both myeloid (32D cl3) and lymphoid (Ba/F3) interleukin (IL)-3–dependent cell lines to become
independent of IL-3 for survival and growth, their ability to stimulate proliferation of Ba/F3 lym-
phoid cells differed and correlated directly with tyrosine kinase activity. In a murine bone marrow
transduction/transplantation model, the three forms of BCR/ABL were equally potent in the in-
duction of a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)–like myeloproliferative syndrome in recipient mice
when 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)–treated donors were used. Analysis of proviral integration showed the
CML-like disease to be polyclonal and to involve multiple myeloid and B lymphoid lineages, im-
plicating a primitive multipotential target cell. Secondary transplantation revealed that only cer-
tain minor clones gave rise to day 12 spleen colonies and induced disease in secondary recipients,
suggesting heterogeneity among the target cell population. In contrast, when marrow from non–
5-FU–treated donors was used, a mixture of CML-like disease, B lymphoid acute leukemia, and
macrophage tumors was observed in recipients. P190 BCR/ABL induced lymphoid leukemia
with shorter latency than P210 or P230. The lymphoid leukemias and macrophage tumors had
provirus integration patterns that were oligo- or monoclonal and limited to the tumor cells, sug-
gesting a lineage-restricted target cell with a requirement for additional events in addition to
BCR/ABL transduction for full malignant transformation. These results do not support the hy-
pothesis that P230 BCR/ABL induces a distinct and less aggressive form of CML in humans, and
suggest that the rarity of P190 BCR/ABL in human CML may reflect infrequent BCR intron 1
breakpoints during the genesis of the Ph chromosome in stem cells, rather than intrinsic differ-
ences in myeloid leukemogenicity between P190 and P210.

T
he BCR/ABL fusion oncogene, the product of the
t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome (Ph),1 exists in three
principal forms (P190, P210, and P230) that arise from dis-
tinct breakpoints in the BCR gene on chromosome 22, re-
sulting in translocation of BCR exon 1 (1), exons 1–12/13
(2), or exons 1–19 (3), respectively, to the c-ABL gene on
chromosome 9. These different oncogenes give rise to
three distinct fusion proteins of molecular mass 190, 210,
and 230 kD, which contain the same portion of the c-Abl
tyrosine kinase in the COOH terminus but include differ-
ent amounts of Bcr sequence at the NH2 terminus.

Different Leukemogenic Activity of P190, P210, and P230 BCR/ABL
In humans, there is evidence that the three different forms
of BCR/ABL are associated with distinct forms of leukemia
(for reviews, see references 4 and 5). The P210 form of
BCR/ABL is found in hematopoietic cells of patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in stable phase, and in
acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias (6–8), although
some patients with acute leukemia and P210 are likely to
be cases of CML diagnosed in blast crisis. In contrast, the
P190 form of BCR/ABL is commonly found in Ph-posi-
tive acute B lymphoid leukemia (ALL [9]) and occasionally
in acute myeloid leukemia (10), but is rarely if ever observed
in CML (11–13). Recently, several patients were described
who had a Ph-positive myeloproliferative syndrome resem-
bling CML but with very mild clinical symptoms, includ-
ing a lower peripheral blood white cell count consisting
principally of neutrophils, less anemia, less severe spleno-
megaly, and a delayed or absent transformation to blast cri-
sis (14). These patients were found to have the BCR exon
19/ABL exon 2 (e19/a2) junction characteristic of P230
BCR/ABL. It was proposed that patients with the e19/a2
fusion comprise a distinct clinical entity called neutrophilic
CML, with a much more benign clinical course than that
associated with the traditional b2/a2 or b3/a2 P210 BCR/
ABL fusion. However, several subsequent reports described
patients with the e19/a2 fusion and typical CML (15–17).
These observations raise the question of whether different
forms of Bcr/Abl protein have intrinsically different leu-
kemogenic activity in hematopoietic cells.
Consideration of the primary structures of P190, P210, and
P230 indicates that P210 and P230 contain several potential
functional motifs encoded by the BCR portion of the fusion
gene (Cdc24/Dbl and plekstrin homology domains and a
portion of a RacGAP catalytic domain, respectively) that
might plausibly alter the oncogenic activity of these larger
proteins relative to P190. Indeed, characterization of the ty-
rosine kinase and in vitro transformation activities of P190
and P210 Bcr/Abl has suggested that these proteins have dis-
tinct transforming properties. In an immune complex kinase
assay, P190 has higher tyrosine kinase than P210, with P190
and P210 activity both elevated relative to c-Abl (18, 19).
P190 is more efficient than P210 in transformation of Rat-1
fibroblasts, as assessed by colony formation in soft agar (18).
Both P210 and P190 BCR/ABL can stimulate the growth of
primary B cells in long-term in vitro cultures, eventually lead-
ing to oligoclonal populations of pre-B cells that are indepen-
dent of stroma and leukemogenic in syngeneic mice (20).
P190 is more potent than P210 in this growth-stimulatory as-
say, with P190-transduced cultures reaching high cell density
and stromal independence more frequently and sooner than
with P210 (21). The mechanism of increased growth stimula-
tion of B lymphoid cells by P190 is not known. Most studies
of P190 and P210 have found similar sets of tyrosine-phos-
phorylated proteins in cells transformed by the two on-
cogenes (22). A notable exception is signal transducer and
activator of transcription STAT6, a transcription factor nor-
mally activated by IL-4 and implicated in lymphoid prolifera-
tive responses (23) that is preferentially tyrosine phosphory-
lated and activated by P190 but not P210 Bcr/Abl (24).
The only model system where Bcr/Abl induces a myelo-
proliferative syndrome closely resembling human CML is
retroviral transduction of mouse bone marrow in vitro, fol-
lowed by transplantation of transduced cells into irradiated
syngeneic recipients (for a review, see reference 25). In this
assay, the P210 form of BCR/ABL induced a fatal CML-
like syndrome with massive elevation of neutrophils and
maturing myeloid cells in peripheral blood, marrow, spleen,
and liver (26–29). In addition to the CML-like syndrome,
other transplanted mice developed leukemias of B lymphoid,
monocyte/macrophage, T lymphoid, or erythroid lineages
(26, 30). Because these mice develop leukemias that closely
resemble several human Ph-positive leukemias, the bone
marrow transduction/transplant model is perhaps the best
system for directly comparing the leukemogenic activity of
different forms of BCR/ABL. However, as originally de-
scribed, the system was hampered by difficulty in generat-
ing high-titer replication-defective BCR/ABL retrovirus
stocks, leading to a low efficiency of generation of diseased
animals. Under the best circumstances, the CML-like syn-
drome was observed in only z25% of transplant recipients,
and some transplanted mice did not develop any malignan-
cies (26). Despite these difficulties, P190 was observed to
induce a similar CML-like syndrome in mice at low fre-
quency (31). In experiments which used replication-com-
petent Moloney murine leukemia helper virus to increase
transduction efficiency, P190 was also observed to induce
myeloid leukemias with excess neutrophils, suggestive of
CML (32). In addition, the latency of P190-induced my-
eloid and lymphoid leukemias after transplant was shorter
than for P210, suggesting that P190 was more potent in the
induction of both types of leukemia.
With modifications to the original bone marrow trans-
duction protocol, we and others (33) have recently been
able to obtain 100% incidence of the CML-like syndrome
in mice transplanted with P210 BCR/ABL-transduced mar-
row, allowing this method to be used as an assay for the
first time. Here, we report a direct comparison of the tyro-
sine kinase activity, in vitro transformation properties, and
in vivo leukemogenic activity of the P190, P210, and P230
forms of BCR/ABL.
Materials and Methods
DNA Constructs.
A cDNA encoding the P230 form of BCR/
ABL was generated by a PCR strategy. A 59 primer containing
the AatII site at nucleotide 3184 in the BCR cDNA open reading
frame and the adjacent e19/a2 BCR/ABL junction sequence and
a 39 primer containing the KpnI site at nucleotide 744 of the hu-
man c-ABL type Ia cDNA were used to generate a 307-bp PCR
product from AatII to KpnI, spanning the P230 BCR/ABL junc-
tion. The product was subcloned and completely sequenced to
verify the correct reading frame and lack of other mutations, then
used to generate a complete P230 cDNA. The P190, P210, and
P230 BCR/ABL cDNAs were introduced as EcoRI fragments
into the unique EcoRI site of the murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-
based retroviral vector, MSCVneoEB (34).

complex kinase assay was as described previously (19, 35), except
that a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Crk120–225 fusion protein
was used as an exogenous substrate. To normalize for the amount
of Abl proteins, cells were labeled for 12 h with [35S]l-methio-
nine before harvesting. The amount of 32P incorporation was
quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (STORM 850; Molecu-
lar Dynamics), whereas 35S incorporation was quantitated by dig-
ital camera and analysis by NIH Image v1.59 software. Relative
protein levels, which were within 15% of one another, were cor-
rected for methionine content and used to normalize 32P incor-
poration to calculate relative kinase activity.
Generation of Retrovirus Stocks.
All DNAs were purified by
two rounds of buoyant density centrifugation in CsCl. 10 mg of
retroviral vector DNA and 5 mg of MCV-ecopac, an ecotropic
single-genome packaging construct (36), were transfected per 6-cm
dish of 293T cl. 17 cells (37), as described (36). Medium was
changed at 24 h, and virus supernatant was harvested at 48 h after
transfection. Supernatant was passed through a 0.45-m filter, ali-
quoted, and frozen at 2808C. An aliquot was thawed, the virus
titer for neomycin resistance was determined by transduction of
NIH 3T3 cells, and a screen for the presence of replication-com-
petent helper virus was carried out with a lacZ-3T3 indicator cell
line. All viruses had titers of 3.5–4.0 3 106 neomycin-resistant
CFU/ml, passed the correct proviral structure by Southern blot
analysis, and were free of detectable helper virus activity.
Transformation of Cytokine-dependent Hematopoietic Cell Lines.
32D cl3 cells and Ba/F3 cells were grown, transduced, and se-
lected for G418 resistance and IL-3 independence as described
previously (19). At 96 h after transduction, viable cells were
counted and plated at 4 3 104 cells in 1.0 ml RPMI medium
without IL-3 and neomycin in triplicate wells of a 24-well plate.
Cells were incubated at 378C, and the viable cell count was de-
termined daily for 3 d.
Bone Marrow Transduction and Transplantation.
All animal stud-
ies were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committees of
the Center for Blood Research and Harvard Medical School.
Balb/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory or Taconic Farms) from
6 to 12 wk of age were used in all experiments. In some experi-
ments, male donor mice were primed by intravenous injection
with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 200 mg/kg) 4 d before harvest. Male
donors were killed by CO2 asphyxiation, femur and tibia were
collected, and bone marrow was harvested by flushing with sy-
ringe and 26-gauge needle. Cells were counted and plated with-
out removal of erythrocytes at 2 3 107 cells per 10-cm plate in
prestimulation medium (38) of DME, 15% (vol/vol) inactivated
FCS, 5% (vol/vol) WEHI-3B conditioned medium, penicillin/
streptomycin, 1.0 mg/ml ciprofloxacin, 200 mM l-glutamine,
6 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (Genzyme), 10 ng/ml recombi-
nant murine IL-6 (Genzyme), and 50–100 ng/ml recombinant mu-
rine stem cell factor (SCF; PeproTech). With non–5-FU–treated
marrow, 10 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-7 (Genzyme) was also
included. After prestimulation for 24 h at 378C, viable cells were
counted and transduced with retroviral stocks in the same me-
dium containing 50% retroviral supernatant, 10 mM Hepes, pH
7.4, and 2 mg/ml polybrene. To increase transduction efficiency
(39), virus and cells were cosedimented at 1,000 g for 90 min in a
Sorvall RT-6000 centrifuge. Medium was changed after a 2–4-h
adsorption period. At 48 h, a second round of transduction and
cosedimentation was performed, and the cells were collected 2 h
later, washed once in HBSS, and counted. Recipient female mice
were prepared by two doses of 450-cGy gamma irradiation sepa-
rated by 3 h. Transduced marrow cells were transplanted by in-
jection of 0.2–0.5 3 106 cells (5-FU–treated marrow) or 1.0 3 106
cells (non–5-FU–treated marrow) in 0.4–0.5 ml HBSS into the
lateral tail vein. After transplant, recipients were housed in micro-
isolator cages supplied with acidified (pH 2.0) water.
Analysis of Diseased Mice.
After transplant, recipient mice were
evaluated daily for signs of morbidity, weight loss, failure to
thrive, and splenomegaly. Premorbid animals were killed by CO2
asphyxiation, peripheral blood was obtained from the retroorbital
venous plexus, and hematopoietic tissues were removed. De-
pending on the individual animal, hematopoietic tissues and cells
were used for several applications, including histopathology, in
vitro culture, FACS® analysis, secondary transplantation, genomic
DNA preparation, protein lysate preparation, or lineage analysis
(see below). The clinical features and histopathology of BCR/
ABL-induced CML-like disease, B lymphoid leukemia, and mac-
rophage tumors were very similar to those observed previously (26).
Lineage Analysis.
Peripheral blood samples generally served as
a nearly pure source of neutrophils and their precursors; on occa-
sion, neutrophils were purified further by positive selection for
Ly-6G (Gr-1) antigen expression by immunomagnetic beads
(MicroMACS®; Miltenyi Biotec). Macrophages were isolated
from peritoneal washes, bone marrow, liver, or spleen by adher-
ence and often subsequent culture on bacterial petri dishes in the
presence of L929-conditioned medium as a source of CSF-1.
Erythroid cells were purified from spleen by sedimentation
through Ficoll-hypaque or by positive selection with TER119
mAb and immunomagnetic beads. B lymphoid cells were puri-
fied from pooled lymph nodes or spleen by positive selection
with anti-B220 mAb, and T cells were purified by isolation of
thymocytes or by positive selection of spleen or peripheral blood
with anti–Thy-1.2 mAb. In all cases, the purity of the population
was assessed by Wright-Giemsa staining of a cytospin specimen,
and only those samples with at least 80% purity as judged from
cell morphology were used for Southern blot analysis. Genomic
DNA was prepared from each population, digested with BglII,
and hybridized with a radioactive probe from the proviral neo-
mycin resistance gene to determine the number of distinct provi-
ral integrations in each sample. Subsequently, the blots were stripped
and reprobed with a radioactive probe from the human c-ABL
gene that detects a common 2.2-kb fragment from all proviruses,
allowing determination of the total proviral content of each he-
matopoietic lineage. To control for differences in DNA loading,
the intensity of hybridization of a fragment from the endogenous
mouse c-abl gene was used as an internal control. Intensity of hy-
bridization was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecu-
lar Dynamics), and the ratio of intensity of hybridization of the
BCR/ABL fragment to murine c-abl fragment was compared with
that of genomic DNA standards containing a single proviral copy,
with the results expressed as proviral copy number per diploid ge-
nome. A proviral copy number of 0.2 or less is consistent with the
absence of provirus from a particular hematopoietic lineage.
Secondary Transplants and Day 12 Spleen Colony Assay.
For adop-
tive transfer of the CML-like syndrome, 1–2 3 106 bone marrow
and/or splenocytes from primary animals were injected intra-
venously into sublethally irradiated (450 cGy) female Balb/c recip-
ient mice. For isolation of day 12 spleen colonies, pairs of lethally
irradiated (900 cGy) Balb/c mice were injected intravenously with
3 3 103, 1 3 104, and 3 3 104 nucleated marrow cells from pri-
mary animals. Recipients were killed 12 d later, spleens were iso-
lated, and macroscopic colonies were dissected out with the aid of
a stereoscopic microscope. For those colonies not visibly red in ap-
pearance, cytospin preparations were examined by Wright-Giemsa
staining to ensure the mixed myeloid origin of the colony. Geno-
mic DNA was then prepared and analyzed as described above.

Different Leukemogenic Activity of P190, P210, and P230 BCR/ABL
Western Blot Analysis.
Protein lysates were prepared from pe-
ripheral blood myeloid cells by resuspension of 107 cells in 75 ml
RIPA buffer with immediate addition of an equal volume of
958C 23 sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Amounts of pro-
tein were standardized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue stain-
ing. From other hematopoietic tissues and cultures, cell lysates in
RIPA were quantitated by Bio-Rad protein assay. SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting with anti-Abl (8E9; PharMingen) and an-
tiphosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibod-
ies were performed as described (19).
Results
P230 Has Lower In Vitro Kinase Activity Than P210 and
P190.
Previous studies indicated that P190 Bcr/Abl had in-
trinsically higher tyrosine kinase activity, measured as auto-
phosphorylation or phosphorylation of an exogenous sub-
strate, than did P210, while both were higher than c-Abl (18,
19). In a direct comparison after immunoprecipitation from
transfected 293 cells, we again confirmed this and found a sig-
nificantly lower kinase activity for P230 Bcr/Abl (Fig. 1).
Corrected for levels of Abl protein, P190 had 7-fold in-
creased phosphorylation of a GST-Crk substrate relative to
c-Abl, whereas P210 and P230 had 5.4- and 3.7-fold in-
creased activity, respectively, with similar results for auto-
phosphorylation. There was no difference in the kinase
activity of c-Abl and the oncogenic SH3-deleted c-Abl
protein, as observed previously (40). Similar results were
obtained when the Bcr/Abl proteins were immunoprecipi-
tated from stably transformed Ba/F3 cells (see below; data
not shown).
The Three Forms of BCR/ABL Induce Different Proliferative
Responses in Cultured Lymphoid Cells.
To compare the trans-
forming ability of the three BCR/ABL oncogenes in cul-
tured hematopoietic cells, we introduced them by retroviral
transduction into IL-3–dependent myeloid (32D cl3) and
lymphoid (Ba/F3) cell lines. P210 BCR/ABL has been pre-
viously demonstrated to transform each cell line to become
independent of IL-3 for survival and growth (41, 42) by a
mechanism that does not involve autocrine production of
growth factors. To avoid any differences due to prolonged
culture in the presence of BCR/ABL, populations of trans-
duced cells were selected in neomycin and immediately de-
prived of IL-3, with measurement of cell survival and prolif-
eration within 96 h of transduction. With both cell types,
populations of cells that were independent of IL-3 for sur-
vival and growth were selected with equal efficiency after
transduction with all three forms of BCR/ABL, but not with
the parental MSCVneoEB virus, demonstrating that P190,
P210, and P230 are all capable of transforming myeloid and
lymphoid cells to cytokine independence (Fig. 2). There was
no difference in the growth rate of 32D cells transduced
with any of the three forms of BCR/ABL in the absence of
IL-3 or of vector-transduced cells in the presence of IL-3
(Fig. 2 A). In contrast, BCR/ABL-transduced Ba/F3 cells
in the absence of IL-3 proliferated more slowly than vec-
tor-transduced cells in the presence of IL-3, with P190-
transduced cells showing the highest proliferation rate, fol-
lowed by P210 and then P230 (Fig. 2 B). The level of
expression of the three Bcr/Abl proteins and the spectrum
of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were similar within each
of the two cell types (data not shown). These results suggest
that the three forms of BCR/ABL induce an identical pro-
liferative response in myeloid factor-dependent cells, but
deliver a submaximal growth stimulus in lymphoid cells
that parallels their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.
All Three Forms of BCR/ABL Induce an Identical CML-like
Syndrome in Mice.
To compare directly the ability of the
three forms of BCR/ABL to induce a myeloproliferative
syndrome in mice, we used the bone marrow transduc-
tion/transplantation model system (26), with several modi-
fications to the original protocol designed principally to in-
crease transduction efficiency (see Materials and Methods).
With the modified protocol, we observed that all mice
transplanted with bone marrow transduced with each of
the three forms of BCR/ABL developed a fatal CML-like
myeloproliferative syndrome within 4 wk after transplanta-
tion when marrow from 5-FU–treated donors was used
(Fig. 3). The disease was characterized principally by mas-
sive expansion of maturing myeloid cells in bone marrow,

spleen, liver, and peripheral blood. The peripheral blood
leukocyte count at death was 2–4 3 105/ml, composed
predominantly of mature neutrophils, along with metamy-
elocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes, indicative of a
shift towards less differentiated myeloid cells. The spleen and
liver were greatly enlarged and disrupted by large numbers
of maturing myeloid cells from the neutrophil lineage,
along with significant erythropoiesis and increased mega-
karyocytes. Nearly all mice with the CML-like syndrome
also had small to medium-sized collections of macrophages
centered on portal areas in the liver. In addition, all animals
had focal consolidation of the lungs with maturing myeloid
cells and extensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which may
have been the ultimate cause of death of these animals.
Bone marrow showed increased cellularity with maturation
and an increased myeloid to erythroid ratio, while lymph
nodes and thymus were normal. In most cases, the CML-
like syndrome could be efficiently transferred to secondary
recipients by injection of bone marrow (data not shown),
but as previously reported (43), for some primary animals
the disease was not readily transplanted.
There was no significant difference in the histopathol-
ogy, average survival, peripheral blood leukocyte count, or
spleen weight of the disease induced by the three forms of
BCR/ABL (Fig. 3 insert, and data not shown). Because the
spleen is the main reservoir of myeloid cells in these dis-
eased mice, this implies that mice transplanted with P190-,
P210-, and P230-transduced marrow have identical total
myeloid cell burdens at death, indicating that the prolifera-
tive stimulus induced in myeloid cells by the three BCR/

Different Leukemogenic Activity of P190, P210, and P230 BCR/ABL
ABL oncogenes is very similar. Although human P1901
CMLs may be characterized by monocytosis (13), the per-
centage of monocytes in peripheral blood of mice with
CML-like disease was ,10% and did not differ significantly
between BCR/ABL genotypes (data not shown).
The CML-like Syndrome Is Polyclonal and Involves Several
Hematopoietic Lineages, Suggesting a Primitive Multipotential
Target Cell.
Mice with the CML-like syndrome were ana-
lyzed for the presence of Bcr/Abl protein by Western blot
and for the BCR/ABL provirus by Southern blot of geno-
mic DNA. Bcr/Abl protein was detected in peripheral blood
leukocytes (principally neutrophils and their precursors; Fig.
4 A) and in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4 B), confirming
the expression of the BCR/ABL provirus in two distinct
myeloid lineages. To identify the BCR/ABL provirus,
genomic DNA from total spleen, liver, peripheral blood, or
bone marrow was digested with XbaI (which cuts once in
each proviral LTR) or BglII (which cuts once in proviral
DNA sequences 39 of the BCR/ABL cDNA insert) and
probed with a radioactive fragment from the neomycin resis-
tance gene. The XbaI digest indicated that these tissues con-
tained the BCR/ABL provirus at about one proviral copy
per cell (Fig. 5), confirming that the increased myeloid cells
in these animals were a primary part of the malignant process
and not a secondary or reactive phenomenon (30, 44). The
BglII digest, which yields a distinct hybridizing fragment for
each unique proviral integration site, demonstrated that mul-
tiple independent clones contributed to the myeloid cell ex-
pansion in these mice (Fig. 5), with 4–12 clones (average 9)
observed in recipients of P190-, P210-, and P230-trans-
duced marrow. Interestingly, the relative abundance of some
clones differed between DNA samples from the same animal,
suggesting a variable contribution of individual clones to
myelopoiesis in different tissues. The presence of polyclonal
disease suggests that the presence of BCR/ABL alone is suffi-
cient to induce the CML-like syndrome.
To determine which hematopoietic lineages were in-
volved in the malignant process, we performed lineage
analysis by purifying different hematopoietic cell popula-
tions and determining the BCR/ABL proviral status by
Southern blot. With all three oncogenes, mice with the
CML-like syndrome carried the BCR/ABL provirus at
or above single-copy levels in neutrophils, macrophages,
erythroid cells, and splenic B lymphoid cells, and in some
cases peripheral node lymphocytes and thymocytes (Fig. 6,
A–C). Most of the independent proviral clones present
were found in each lineage. These data indicate transduc-
tion of a bone marrow target cell capable of differentiation
via multiple myeloid and lymphoid pathways, suggesting
that the BCR/ABL target cell for the CML-like syndrome
is a multipotential progenitor cell.
To further define the nature of this target cell, we per-
formed secondary transplant experiments to isolate day 12
spleen colonies derived from selected primary mice with the
CML-like syndrome. Such colonies are clonal, of mixed my-
eloid origin, have limited self-renewal potential, and are de-

rived from a cell (CFU-S12) with characteristics of an early
multipotential progenitor with some stem cell–like properties
(45). It was previously shown (26) that an animal with the
CML-like syndrome carried the retroviral provirus in the ma-
jority of secondary day 12 spleen colonies, suggesting that the
target cell for the CML-like syndrome was an early progeni-
tor that could generate CFU-S12. In this study, we also de-
tected the BCR/ABL provirus in the majority of day 12
spleen colonies in secondary transplants from mice with the
CML-like syndrome (Fig. 6, A, B, and D). Collectively, in
10 primary animals with the CML-like syndrome, 64% (28
out of 44) of day 12 spleen colonies from secondary trans-
plants carried the BCR/ABL provirus (Fig. 6, and data not
shown). Interestingly, of the many distinct proviral clones
present in the bone marrow of the primary animals, a small
subset of clones was detected frequently or exclusively in sec-
ondary day 12 spleen colonies. For example, two minor
clones were found in four out of seven colonies derived from
an animal with P190-induced CML-like disease (Fig. 6 A),
whereas a single minor clone generated seven out of eight
colonies from a mouse with P210-induced disease (Fig. 6 D).
We observed a similar phenomenon in secondary recipi-
ents that developed the CML-like syndrome after trans-
plantation of larger numbers of marrow cells. Instead of
developing polyclonal disease with the same spectrum of pro-
viral clones as the primary animal, myeloid cells from sec-
ondary mice with CML-like disease typically contained only
a single minor clone from the donor (Fig. 6, C and D). In
one animal, the same clone that contributed exclusively to
day 12 spleen colonies was also recovered from secondary
mice with CML-like disease (Fig. 6 D). These findings sug-
gest that the target cell for induction of the CML-like syn-
drome is heterogeneous, with all clones exhibiting multi-
lineage repopulating ability but only some clones capable of
efficient generation of CFU-S12 and secondary disease.
P190 BCR/ABL Induces More Aggressive B Lymphoid Leu-
kemia Than P210 or P230 When Non–5-FU–treated Marrow
Is Used for Transduction.
Because animals with the CML-
like syndrome die within 4 wk of transplantation, it is not
possible to assess the incidence or severity of BCR/ABL-
induced hematologic malignancies of longer latency or
duration in this system. Multipotential myeloid target cells
for BCR/ABL are enriched for by 5-FU treatment (46),
whereas the target cell for Abelson virus–induced pre-B
leukemia is fairly abundant in normal marrow from Balb/c
mice (47). Therefore, we reasoned that the use of bone mar-
row from donors that had not been pretreated with 5-FU
might allow us to observe the characteristics of other leuke-
mias induced by BCR/ABL, including lymphoid leukemia.
Indeed, when marrow from non–5-FU–treated donors
was used for retroviral transduction, we observed three dis-
tinct hematopoietic neoplasms with each of the three forms
of BCR/ABL (Fig. 7). We observed the CML-like syn-
drome in about half of transplant recipients. The survival of
mice with the CML-like syndrome induced by transduc-
tion of non–5-FU marrow (21–49 d) was somewhat longer
than for recipients of 5-FU–treated marrow. Otherwise,
the syndrome appeared pathologically identical to that ob-
served with 5-FU–treated marrow, with increased neutro-
phil counts, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulmonary hemor-
rhage. Analysis of proviral integration in myeloid cells
showed that significantly fewer (one to three) independent
proviral clones contributed to the CML-like disease in
these mice, compared with recipients of transduced mar-
row from 5-FU–treated donors (Fig. 5). Lineage analysis of
selected mice demonstrated the same proviral clone(s) in
neutrophils, macrophages, erythroid cells, and B lymphoid
cells (data not shown), indicating the target cell for the
CML-like disease in normal marrow, like that from 5-FU–
treated marrow, had multilineage differentiation potential.
The other animals developed acute leukemia of B lym-
phoid type, or tumors of monocyte/macrophages. Animals
with B lymphoid leukemia exhibited modest splenomegaly
(0.2–0.4 g) and lymphadenopathy with infiltration with lym-
phoblasts, and a bloody pleural effusion, containing high lev-
els of malignant lymphoid cells, that appeared to be the cause
of death. The lymphoblasts expressed high levels of Bcr/Abl
protein (Fig. 4 C), were negative for myeloid and T lym-
phoid cell surface markers, but positive for CD45R (B220),

bone marrow (BM) was digested with the indicated restriction enzyme,
transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with a radioactive probe
to the proviral neomycin resistance gene, as described in Materials and
Methods. In one case, Gr-11 peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated
from a P230-transduced animal with mixed CML and ALL. The XbaI di-
gest (X) yields a single full-length proviral species from each individual
clone, and indicates presence of the provirus at about single-copy levels in
myeloid cells of all four mice. The BglII digest (B) yields a distinct sized
species for each individual proviral integration. Control DNA samples
from a P210 BCR/ABL-transformed B cell line containing a single provi-
rus are used to indicate one proviral copy per diploid genome.

posed exclusively of macrophages. The tumor cells expressed
high levels of Bcr/Abl protein (Fig. 4 B) and were positive
for the cell surface markers Mac-1 and F4/80 but negative
for lymphoid markers (data not shown). Some mice exhib-

clone containing an amplified, rearranged provirus (data not shown); because of this frequent tendency, short-term adherence was used subsequently for
purification of macrophages. (C) Lineage analysis of a primary animal with P210-induced CML-like disease, and of a secondary marrow transplant recip-

malignancies, it was relatively easy to recognize these animals
based upon clinical features and histopathology.
The survival curve of mice transplanted with P190-
transduced marrow differed significantly from that of P210-
or P230-transduced recipients (50% death in 25 d vs. 43
and 50 d, respectively; Fig. 7). Principally, this was because
P190 induced B lymphoid leukemia in the majority (6/8)
of recipients, which rapidly lead to the death of the host. In
contrast, recipients of P210- or P230-transduced marrow
that developed B lymphoid leukemia (3/9 and 5/7 mice,
respectively) succumbed to these diseases much later after
transplantation. The longer latency associated with P210 and
P230 appeared to reflect a longer time required for estab-
lishment of the disease rather than a more aggressive leuke-
mia, because the survival of secondary recipients trans-
planted with 3 3 106 malignant lymph node cells from
either P190- or P210-induced leukemia was similar, z4 wk
(data not shown). These data confirm earlier observations
on the relative potency of P190 and P210 BCR/ABL for in
vitro lymphoid transformation (21), and suggest that P190
induces lymphoid leukemia with shorter latency and per-
haps greater efficiency than either P210 or P230.
The Lymphoid Leukemias and Macrophage Tumors Are Oli-
go- or Monoclonal and Lineage Restricted.
To further char-
acterize the lymphoid leukemias and macrophage tumors,
we analyzed genomic DNA from the primary tumors
(lymph node or pleural effusion cells for the lymphoid leu-
kemias, and liver, ascites, or purified macrophages for the
macrophage tumors). In addition, we performed lineage
analysis and isolated secondary day 12 spleen colonies from
selected mice. In contrast to the polyclonal nature of the
CML-like syndrome, we generally observed only one or
two independent proviral integrations in the lymphoid
leukemias and macrophage tumors (Fig. 8, A–C). In some
mice with lymphoid leukemia, different clones predomi-
nated in different anatomical sites such as lymph nodes and
the pleural effusion. The presence of oligo- or monoclonal
disease suggests that the presence of BCR/ABL alone is
insufficient to induce these diseases, and that secondary ge-
netic or epigenetic events are required.
In contrast to the CML-like syndrome, where provirus-
positive cells were observed in multiple myeloid and lym-
phoid lineages in addition to the neutrophils, the provirus
in the B lymphoid leukemias and macrophage tumors was
confined to the tumor cells, and not present in cells of
other hematopoietic lineages (Fig. 8, B and C). In animals
with the macrophage disease, provirus was absent from the
neutrophils, a closely related myeloid lineage. In those ani-
mals diagnosed with two diseases based on clinicopatholog-
ical criteria, two different proviral integrants were usually
observed, restricted to the individual tumors (26; Fig. 8 B,
and data not shown). In addition, provirus was uniformly
absent from day 12 spleen colonies derived from bone mar-
row of these mice; collectively, a total of 47 colonies derived
from 3 primary animals with lymphoid leukemia and 3 pri-
mary animals with macrophage disease lacked the retroviral
provirus (Fig. 8, B and C, and data not shown). These re-
sults suggest that the target cells for these diseases are pro-
genitor cells whose differentiation capacity is lineage re-
stricted and cannot give rise to CFU-S12.
Discussion
In human Ph-positive leukemia, the clear association of
different forms of the BCR/ABL oncogene with distinct
types of leukemia begs a biological explanation. This is
most evident for P190 BCR/ABL, which is only rarely if
ever observed in CML. Recently, it has been suggested
that the P230 form of BCR/ABL identifies a group of pa-
tients with a distinctly benign form of CML, neutrophilic
CML (14). There are two models that might explain such a
phenotypic correlation with different BCR/ABL geno-
types. It is possible that the three forms of BCR/ABL have
different intrinsic leukemogenic activities when expressed
in a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a t(9;
22) translocation. Alternatively, the three oncogenes might
have identical leukemogenic properties, but their expres-
sion might be largely restricted to different hematopoietic
lineages because a particular chromosome 22 breakpoint is
favored in a given lineage during the formation of the Ph
chromosome. For example, in this model, the BCR intron
1 breakpoint might be frequent in B lymphoid progenitor

Different Leukemogenic Activity of P190, P210, and P230 BCR/ABL
cells but uncommon in hematopoietic stem cells, explain-
ing the rarity of P190 BCR/ABL in CML.
Several studies of the cell of origin of the Ph chromo-
some translocation appear to support the latter model. In
CML patients, the Ph chromosome is present in myeloid,
erythroid, megakaryocytic, and B lymphoid cells, confirm-
ing that the t(9;22) translocation took place in a very early
multipotential progenitor or stem cell (48). In Ph-positive
ALL, about half of adult patients have traditional BCR in-
tron 13 or 14 breakpoints on chromosome 22 generating
the P210 form of BCR/ABL. Some of these patients have
persistence of the Ph chromosome in remission and carry
the Ph chromosome in myeloid cells and myeloid colonies
grown in vitro, suggesting they represent cases of CML
presenting in blast crisis after an unrecognized chronic phase
(6–8, 49). In contrast, the majority of ALL patients with the
BCR intron 1 breakpoint characteristic of P190 BCR/ABL
do not exhibit the additional cytogenetic abnormalities
typical of CML blast crisis, lack the Ph chromosome in my-
eloid cells, and become Ph-negative during clinical remis-
sions, suggesting they represent transformation of a cell
type that is more limited in its differentiation potential (50).
However, some patients with P190-associated ALL show
persistence of the Ph chromosome in remission and in my-
eloid cells, suggesting a multipotential target cell (51–53).

at a total of one proviral copy per cell in
malignant peritoneal macrophages. Provirus
is absent from peripheral blood (z80% neu-
trophils), from bone marrow and spleen cells
that sedimented through Ficoll-Hypaque (ficoll pellet; entirely neutrophils and immature erythroid cells by cytospin analysis), and from splenic T lym-
phocytes (spleen Thy-11). Provirus was also absent from 14 day 12 spleen colonies derived from this mouse. (C) Lineage analysis of a mouse with BCR/ABL-
induced B lymphoid leukemia. This animal demonstrated two distinct proviral integrations in tumor cells, one predominant in lymph node and the other
in spleen and marrow, with both clones contributing to peripheral blood. Provirus is absent from peritoneal macrophages, bone marrow neutrophils, and
decreased in thymocytes and TER1191 splenocytes, both of which were contaminated with blasts at z25%.

Li et al.
with neutrophilic CML have not been reported. There-
fore, the available clinical and molecular studies of human
Ph-positive leukemia patients do not provide a biological
distinction between the above two models.
The purpose of this study was to characterize the kinase
activity and in vitro transformation properties of the newly
described P230 Bcr/Abl protein, and to compare the in vivo
leukemogenic activity of the three principal forms of Bcr/
Abl to distinguish between these alternative models. We
found elevated kinase activity for P230 Bcr/Abl relative to
c-Abl, although the activity of P230 was reproducibly lower
than that of P210. While all three forms of BCR/ABL trans-
formed IL-3–dependent myeloid and lymphoid cell lines to
IL-3 independence, they were all less effective than IL-3 at
promoting the growth of Ba/F3 lymphoid cells, with the
rates of proliferation directly correlating with the intrinsic ty-
rosine kinase activity of Bcr/Abl. The reason for this differ-
ence is not known, but it is plausible that increased tyrosine
phosphorylation of critical substrates such as STAT6 by P190
might contribute to proliferation.
To test the hypothesis that the three forms of BCR/ABL
have different leukemogenic properties in vivo, we used
the bone marrow transduction/transplantation model sys-
tem. This assay allowed us to directly determine whether
P190 is able to cause a CML-like syndrome and whether
P230 is less potent than P210 upon transduction of an
identical spectrum of primary hematopoietic cells. When
the three forms of BCR/ABL were transduced into mar-
row from donors treated with 5-FU, they induced an iden-
tical fatal CML-like disease in recipients transplanted with
the transduced cells, with no appreciable differences in histo-
pathology, hematologic parameters, or disease latency. These
observations argue that the three forms of BCR/ABL induce
an identical proliferative stimulus to myeloid cells in our ex-
perimental model. Human patients with neutrophilic CML
are described as having lower peripheral blood leukocyte
counts, less splenomegaly, and requiring little or no myelo-
suppressive therapy (14), features which imply less myeloid
cell proliferation and expansion relative to traditional CML.
However, our results do not support the hypothesis that
P230 generates a weaker proliferative stimulus in myeloid
cells than P210, and suggest that the mild clinical symptoms
observed in some patients with P230 BCR/ABL are due to
other variables, such as genetic differences between individu-
als or a selection bias (15–17). In recipients of transduced
marrow from non–5-FU–treated donors, there is a sugges-
tion of increased latency of P210- and P230-induced CML-
like disease compared with P190, which leaves open the
possibility of differences in BCR/ABL-induced CML-like
disease under conditions where small numbers of proviral
clones and perhaps lower Bcr/Abl expression exist.
Similarly, because P190 BCR/ABL can induce a CML-
like syndrome in mice which is identical to that induced by
P210, it is difficult to argue that the rarity of P190 in hu-
man CML reflects different leukemogenic activity of P190
in myeloid cells. Rather, our results suggest that the restric-
tion of P190 BCR/ABL to human acute leukemias may be
due to a relative lack of BCR first intron breakpoints dur-
ing the generation of the Ph chromosome in stem cells. Al-
ternatively, patients with the P190 form of BCR/ABL may
develop the Ph translocation in a stem cell but manifest
only a brief chronic phase. This is supported by a recent
study of human P190-positive ALL, where the Ph chromo-
some was detected by interphase fluorescence in situ hybrid-
ization in granulocytes of five out of five patients, suggest-
ing multilineage involvement (53).
Although there was no difference between the three
BCR/ABL oncogenes in induction of a CML-like disease
in recipients of transduced marrow from 5-FU–treated do-
nors, there was a highly significant difference in survival of
recipients of P190-transduced marrow compared with re-
cipients of P210- and P230-transduced marrow when do-
nors were not pretreated with 5-FU. Under these condi-
tions, rather than succumbing to CML-like disease, most
recipients of P190-transduced marrow developed B lym-
phoid leukemia. Although several recipients of P210- and
P230-transduced marrow also developed B lymphoid leu-
kemia, the disease developed significantly later with P210
and P230. These results demonstrate that P190 BCR/ABL
induces lymphoid leukemia in vivo with shorter latency
than P210 or P230, and are in agreement with previous
studies which found P190 to be more potent than P210 at
transformation of B lymphoid cells in vitro (21) and induc-
tion of lymphoid leukemia after marrow transduction (32).
Our data further suggest that P230 and P210 have similar
lymphoid leukemogenic activity. The mechanism of the
increased lymphoid leukemogenic activity of P190 relative
to P210 and P230 is not known. One possibility is that the
increased intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of P190 allows
elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of a substrate critical to
proliferation or transformation of lymphoid cells. One can-
didate for such a key substrate is STAT6, whose DNA-
binding activity is activated via tyrosine phosphorylation by
P190 but not P210 (24). In support of this, we have ob-
served that bone marrow from stat62/2 mice (23) exhibits
significant resistance to transformation by P190 BCR/ABL
in vitro when compared with stat61/1 marrow (our un-
published observations). An alternative possibility is that
the presence of distinct functional motifs in the Bcr portion
of P210 and P230 BCR/ABL impairs lymphoid transfor-
mation by these oncogenes. The only known domain com-
mon to P210 and P230 but lacking in P190 is a homology
to Cdc24Hs/Dbl, which is a member of a class of guanine
nucleotide exchange factors for small G proteins of the
Rac/Cdc42 family. Our system allows us to readily test the
importance of this domain in lymphoid leukemogenesis.
What accounts for the very different spectrum of leuke-
mia observed when non–5-FU–treated marrow is used?
Data in this report argue that the CML-like disease, B lym-
phoid leukemia, and macrophage disease are the conse-
quence of BCR/ABL transduction of distinct bone marrow
target cells, and the relative abundance and/or infectability
of these target cells is influenced by 5-FU treatment of do-
nors. In mice with the CML-like syndrome, multiple my-
eloid and lymphoid lineages carry the same spectrum of
proviral clones, demonstrating that the target cell is a pro-
1410
Different Leukemogenic Activity of P190, P210, and P230 BCR/ABL
genitor with both lymphoid and myeloerythroid differenti-
ation potential. In addition, we found the BCR/ABL
provirus in the majority of secondary day 12 spleen colo-
nies derived from primary mice with the CML-like syn-
drome, demonstrating that some of these target cells can
generate CFU-S12. In contrast, the bone marrow target
cells for induction of BCR/ABL-induced B lymphoid leu-
kemia and macrophage disease have restricted in vivo dif-
ferentiation potential, so that provirus-positive cells do not
contribute to other hematopoietic lineages; further, the
provirus is never found in day 12 spleen colonies derived
by secondary transplantation of marrow from these animals.
These observations suggest the BCR/ABL B lymphoid
leukemia target cell is a committed B lymphoid progenitor
similar or identical to the Abelson virus target cell, which is
known to be an immature Thy-1loB2201 committed lym-
phoid progenitor (54) that is distinct from CFU-S12 (55).
Analysis of proviral integration patterns suggests other
pathogenetic differences between BCR/ABL-induced CML-
like disease and B lymphoid leukemia. The CML-like dis-
ease observed in recipients of transduced marrow from
5-FU–treated donors is polyclonal, whereas the B lymphoid
leukemias are mono- or oligoclonal. The short latency of
the CML-like disease together with the polyclonal nature
suggest that BCR/ABL alone is capable of inducing CML-
like disease, whereas the longer latency and monoclonal
nature of the B lymphoid leukemias imply that expression
of BCR/ABL alone may be insufficient for malignant
transformation of primary B lymphocytes and that addi-
tional events are required, a concept supported by many
previous observations (20, 56–59). However, proof of the
sufficiency of BCR/ABL for induction of the CML-like
disease will require limiting dilution analysis and knowl-
edge of the efficiency of infection of the CML target cell.
Interestingly, we and others (29) have found evidence
for heterogeneity among the presumptive target cells for
the murine CML-like syndrome. Of the many clones con-
tributing to the expansion of myeloid cells in several primary
CML animals, only one or two relatively minor clones were
observed to contribute to day 12 spleen colonies and to ef-
ficiently transfer the CML-like disease in secondary trans-
plants. These data imply two distinct target cells for the
murine CML-like syndrome, both with the capacity for
multilineage differentiation in the primary animal, but with
different ability for repopulation of secondary recipients.
These properties are reminiscent of the hierarchy of murine
hematopoietic stem cells, where a distinct population of
progenitor cells enriched for CFU-S12 has transient multi-
lineage repopulating and self-renewal potential, and a more
differentiated subset lacks secondary transplantability (60).
An alternative possibility is that all the CML target cells are
equivalent immediately after infection, but additional ge-
netic or epigenetic abnormalities confer transplantability on
a small subset of transduced progenitors. Distinguishing be-
tween these models will require isolation of the various tar-
get cells from whole marrow.
We found small to medium-sized accumulations of macro-
phages in the livers of nearly every animal with the CML-
like syndrome. Previous studies have shown that some ani-
mals with extensive BCR/ABL-induced macrophage tumors
exhibit elevated serum GM-CSF and/or G-CSF levels,
and a secondary elevation in peripheral blood neutrophils
that lack the retroviral provirus and are therefore not a di-
rect part of a malignant process (26, 30, 44). In our study,
immunoassay of plasma from several mice with primary or
secondary CML-like disease revealed normal levels of GM-
CSF but increased levels of IL-3 (data not shown). The bi-
ological significance of the elevation in plasma IL-3 in these
animals is not clear and is under investigation. However, in
contrast to mice with primary macrophage tumors, the neu-
trophils in all animals with the CML-like disease contain
the retroviral provirus and express Bcr/Abl protein, dem-
onstrating that this disease represents a bona fide myelopro-
liferative process. The lineage analysis suggests that the
macrophage collections in mice with the CML-like syn-
drome represent the product of differentiation of the my-
eloid clones, as previously suggested (32).
Our original goal in expressing BCR/ABL in the murine
hematopoietic system by retroviral transduction (26) was to
determine whether BCR/ABL was the direct cause of CML,
a point which has been established beyond reasonable doubt
(26–29). However, our initial model system was difficult to
use for comparative studies because of the low efficiency and
variability of induction of the CML-like disease. In this report,
the mouse bone marrow transduction/transplantation system
has been improved, and we have used this system for a direct
comparison of the leukemogenic properties of the three prin-
cipal forms of BCR/ABL. We found no significant difference
in the ability of the three oncogenes to induce a CML-like
myeloproliferative syndrome, but observed that P190 BCR/
ABL had increased potency for induction of B lymphoid leu-
kemia. This model system should be very useful for studying
the molecular pathophysiology of the Ph-positive leukemias,
such as testing the requirement for various functional domains
of Bcr/Abl, determining signaling pathways relevant to leuke-
mogenesis, and investigating the physiological effects of BCR/
ABL expression in primary hematopoietic cells.

Yellow fever (YF) is a serious public health
problem in many tropical countries in Africa and
South America. In South America, most
infections are sporadic, affecting unvaccinated
persons who enter the forest; monkeys are the
primary reservoirs, and Haemagoggus sp. are
the vectors. French Guiana, located between
Brazil and Surinam in the Amazonian forest, has
had many epidemics of YF. However, no case has
been reported in French Guiana since 1902,
although a serologic survey in 1951 found
circulating virus; of 430 persons younger than 50
years of age (who had not been affected by the
1902 epidemic), 9% of those living in the coastal
area and 29% of those living inland had
significant titers of neutralizing YF antibodies
(1). A study conducted at the same time in
Surinam showed even higher rates of YF
seropositivity in persons who had not been
exposed to previous epidemics and confirmed
that YF viruses were circulating in the region
(2). In French Guiana, YF immunization became
compulsory in 1967.
Case Report
In March 1998, an Amerindian woman living
in a forest area on the Maroni River was
admitted to the health center in Maripasoula,
French Guiana, with fever, headache, abdominal
pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was treated for
malaria because of a Plasmodium falciparum
positive blood smear. Two days later, the
patients fever increased (40.2°C), she became
jaundiced, and she was evacuated to the
intensive care unit (ICU) at Cayenne Hospital
with multiple visceral failure: shock syndrome,
renal failure (blood urea level 32 mmol/l,
creatinine level 656 µmol/l), and liver failure
(total bilirubin level 314 µmol/l, alanine
aminotransferase 2048 IU/l, aspartate amino
transferase 6256 IU/l, prothrombin level 23%).
No hemorrhages were noted. Despite symptom-
atic treatment, the condition of the patient
deteriorated rapidly, and she died a few hours
after admission to ICU.
Blood cultures were negative for bacterial
pathogens. Because of anuria, urine cultures
were not possible, and albuminuria could not be
tested. Examination of peripheral blood smears
showed no parasites on admission to ICU and
titers of antibodies to leptospira were low.
Microscopy examination of postmortem liver
biopsies showed histopathologic changes charac-
teristic of YF: midzonal necrosis with a small rim
of a few viable periportal and pericentral
hepatocytes 
and 
centrilobular 
cells 
with
microsteatosis and eosinophilic degeneration
with round, eosinophilic cytoplasmic structures
(Councilman bodies).
A serum sample collected before death and a
serum sample obtained from the patient in 1994
during a seroepidemiologic study on HTLV-I
infection and stored at -80°C at the Institut
Pasteur de la Guyane, French Guiana, were
tested for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM
specific for three flaviviruses (YF, dengue, and
Saint Louis encephalitis), two alphaviruses
Tonate and Mayaro), and a new world

The first case of yellow fever in French Guiana since 1902 was reported in March
1998. The yellow fever virus genome was detected in postmortem liver biopsies by
seminested polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis showed that this strain was
most closely related to strains from Brazil and Ecuador.

arenavirus 
(Tacaribe), 
by 
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (3). A plaque reduction
neutralization test was also used to detect YF-
neutralizing antibodies (4). The serum collected
in 1998 contained IgM (but not IgG) that
specifically recognized YF antigens. IgM specific
for other flavivirus antigens (dengue, Saint
Louis 
encephalitis) 
were 
not 
found. 
The
neutralizing antibody titer of the 1998 serum as
assessed by plaque reduction neutralization test
was 20. In the serum collected in 1994, no YF
virusspecific antibodies were detected by any
technique. IgG to Mayaro virus was detected in
both sera; no other antibodies to alphaviruses
and arenaviruses were detected.
Serum and homogenized liver samples from
the patient were diluted 10-fold in Leibowitz
medium containing 3% fetal calf serum, and
dilutions were injected into subconfluent AP 61
cell cultures (5). After 7 days, cells were
harvested and tested for YF virus by an indirect
immunofluorescence assay using a monoclonal
antibody from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO, USA. YF virus
was not isolated by cell culture from either blood
or liver samples.
Reverse 
transcriptionpolymerase 
chain
reaction (RT-PCR) tests were performed on RNA
extracted from serum and liver (6). RNA of the
YF virus was detected by RT-PCR after
seminested PCR only in the liver sample. The
542-bp PCR product was purified and directly
sequenced with an automatic sequencing system
(ACTgene, EuroSequence Gene Services, Evry,
France). The first 309 nucleotides of the
3' noncoding sequence were aligned with those of
sequenced YF strains from Genbank (7,8).
Sequences were aligned with the Clustal W
program. Bootstrap confidence limits were
calculated from 100 replicates with the program
SEQBOOT. Phylogenetic analyses were per-
formed by maximum parsimony by using the
DNAPARS program with uniform character
weights and a heuristic search option. All branch
lengths were drawn to scale by the program
Treetool. The sequence of the YF strain isolated
in 1998 was deposited in Genbank (accession
number: AF121952).
The sequence of the amplified gene differed
at 11 positions (3.5% nucleotide divergence) from
that of a Brazilian strain isolated in 1935 and at
21 positions (6.8% nucleotide divergence) from
that of a strain isolated in Ecuador in 1979. The
sequence diverged more from strains isolated in
Peru (1995) and Trinidad (1979) (8.1% and 10%
divergence, respectively). As expected, African
strains differed more, with those of West Africa
(from Nigeria and Senegal) being less distant
than those from East and Central Africa
(Uganda and Central African Republic). The
nucleotide sequence downstream from the NS5
stop codon in the 3' noncoding region of the YF
virus was deleted in the French Guianese strain,
as in several South American YF viruses (9).
Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences con-
firmed that the virus was most closely related to
those isolated in Brazil and Ecuador (Figure).
Conclusions
The histopathologic changes of the liver were
characteristic of YF but also of other hemor-
rhagic fever viruses. The IgMs were only slightly
above the cut-off values used in the laboratory.
Although YF was highly probable, the diagnosis
required confirmation by detection of the virus or
its genome. Indeed, in 1990 a suspected case of
YF 
was 
reported 
to 
the 
World 
Health
Organization because of characteristic histo-
pathologic changes, but the case was never
confirmed (presence of IgG but no IgM specific
for YF, no detection of the virus in liver or
serum); later it was shown that the patient had
been vaccinated against YF 1 year before (10).
However, because YF requires health authori-
ties to take specific measures, confirmation of the
diagnosis is important, especially when YF is not
prevalent. The case we described was confirmed
by RT-PCR from liver only, because the serum
sample was taken on day 6 when viremia is
usually resolved and because the sensitivity of
cell culture for virus in liver samples is very low
(probably because of biliary salts toxicity). This
case underscores the need for postmortem liver
biopsies for detecting the viral genome to
confirm diagnosis.
This patient did not leave her village the
months before infection; she was probably
infected while working in forest clearings. The
detection of a YF virus in French Guiana nearly
a century after the last report is notable;
however, the absence of reported cases during
the previous years is surprising because no
natural borders exist between this country and
northern Brazil, where YF is not uncommon (11).
A severe YF outbreak would have easily been
detected, but sporadic cases can be misdiagnosed

yellow fever (YF) isolated in French Guiana in 1998

DNAPARS program. Numbers indicate bootstrap
values for groups to the right. One µl (30 ng) of primer
VD8 (5'-GGGTCTCCTCTAACCTCTAG-3') was mixed
with RNA resuspended in 10 µl of distilled water; the
mixture was heated at 95°C for 2 minutes and placed
on ice. cDNA was synthesized in a mixture containing
reverse transcriptase (RT) incubation buffer (pro-
vided by the manufacturer), 0.2 mM of each of the
four dNTPs, 20 units RNasine, and five units of AMV
RT (Promega, Charbonnières, France) by incubation
for 1 hour at 42°C. cDNA was amplified by PCR. Four
µl of the cDNA sample was added to 46 µl of a mixture
containing Taq polymerase buffer (provided by the
manufacturer), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM of each of
the 4 dNTPs, 300 ng of primer VD8 and of degenerate
primer EMF1 (5'-TGGATGACSACKGARGAYATG-3')
(S = C, G; K = G, T; R = A, G; Y = C, T), and 0.5 unit
of 
Taq 
polymerase 
(Promega, 
Charbonnières,
France). After 5 minutes of denaturation at 95°C, the
mixture was subjected to 30 polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) cycles: 95°C for 30 seconds, 53°C for 90
seconds, and 72°C for 60 seconds, followed by a final
10-minute polymerization step at 72°C. Four µl of a 1
in 100 dilution of the PCR products was used for
seminested PCR using primers VD8 and NS5YF
(5'-ATGCAGGACAAGACAATGGT-3'). After the de-
naturation step, DNA was amplified by 25 cycles of
PCR: 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 90 seconds, and
72°C for 120 seconds, followed by a final extension
step at 72°C. Negative controls (serum from healthy
persons) were included in the series. The positive
control (supernatant of infected mosquito cells) was
tested separately to avoid any contamination. The
phylogenetic analysis was conducted by the Pasteur
Institute in Paris.
as other fevers or as hepatitis (when jaundice is
present) and may be not tested for YF even
though serologic and YF virus detection tests are
performed for each suspected case.
No other case was diagnosed in the patients
family or neighborhood, but sporadic cases are
common in South America (12), probably because
of poorly anthropophilic vectors. Furthermore,
in this area, approximately 90% of the population
have been vaccinated at least once (R. Pignoux,
unpub. data). Outbreaks are common among
nonhuman primates, but no epidemic has
occurred in the area where the patient lived.
However, YF incidence increased in northern
Brazil in 1998 (13).
This case calls attention to vaccination
problems in French Guiana, especially along the
rivers. Our patient had been vaccinated in 1985,
but the absence of neutralizing antibodies in
1994 indicates that the vaccination was not
effective. Although this patient may have had a
poor antibody response, more likely inadequate
storage of the vaccine before use was responsible.
In 1985, YF vaccines were less thermostable
than now, and the cold chain was difficult to
maintain. 
In 
response 
to 
this 
case, 
an
immunization campaign was initiated in this
area in May.
Vaccination of the population must continue
since YF can reappear. The immunization
program 
implemented 
in 
French 
Guiana
(compulsory vaccination of children older than
1 year of age, booster YF vaccination every 10
years, and required vaccination certificate before
entering school) should avert the threat of
outbreaks in urban areas, which have a vaccine
coverage rate of approximately 80%. However,
the risk for sporadic cases in unvaccinated
persons will persist, and so active serologic and
virologic surveillance of YF remains necessary.

Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (I-PAP) is a rare disease of unknown etiology in
which the alveoli fill with lipoproteinaceous material. We report here that I-PAP is an autoim-
mune disease with neutralizing antibody of immunoglobulin G isotype against granulocyte/
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The antibody was found to be present in all
specimens of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from 11 I-PAP patients but not in samples
from 2 secondary PAP patients, 53 normal subjects, and 14 patients with other lung diseases. It
specifically bound GM-CSF and neutralized bioactivity of the cytokine in vitro. The antibody
was also found in sera from all I-PAP patients examined but not in sera from a secondary PAP
patient or normal subjects, indicating that it exists systemically in I-PAP patients. As lack of
GM-CSF signaling causes PAP in congenital cases and PAP-like disease in murine models, our
findings strongly suggest that neutralization of GM-CSF bioactivity by the antibody causes dys-
function of alveolar macrophages, which results in reduced surfactant clearance.

P
ulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a heterogeneous
group of congenital and acquired diseases characterized
by accumulation of excessive surfactant composed of phos-
pholipids and surfactant proteins designated as surfactant
protein (SP)-A, -B, -C, and -D in the alveoli and terminal
bronchioli (1, 2).
Most PAPs are acquired cases that predominantly affect
adults, including idiopathic (I)-PAP and secondary (S)-PAP
cases. S-PAP was reported in several clinical settings, such
as pulmonary infection, hematologic malignancies, and in-
halation of chemicals and minerals (3). The most common
form is I-PAP, but its etiology is still not known. Standard
therapy of the disease is whole lung lavage, which usually
provides temporal symptomatic relief (4). The accumula-
tion of surfactant protein is due to reduced surfactant clear-
ance rather than excessive secretion, and SP-A specifically
increases in the lungs of PAP patients as compared with
other surfactant proteins (5, 6). Because alveolar macro-
phages (AMs) catabolize SP-A (7), it was suggested that de-
fective SP-A clearance in AMs caused PAP.
One kind of congenital form is associated with defective
expression of the b chain of the GM-CSF receptor in he-
matopoietic cells (8). In mice, a defect in the gene for GM-
CSF or the b chain of the GM-CSF receptor results in
PAP-like disease with alveolar accumulation of surfactant
(9, 10). Thus, lack of GM-CSF signaling seems to cause
AM dysfunction that leads to PAP.
Recently, we found a factor in the bronchoalveolar la-
vage fluid (BALF) from I-PAP patients that neutralized the
bioactivity of GM-CSF (11). The factor directly bound
GM-CSF and blocked its binding to GM-CSF receptors
on the cells. Here we show that the factor is a neutralizing
autoantibody directed against GM-CSF and present in the
BALF and sera of patients with I-PAP. We propose that
the autoantibody against GM-CSF is a causative agent for
I-PAP.
Materials and Methods
Subjects.
We obtained BALF from 11 patients with I-PAP, 2
patients with S-PAP, 14 patients with other lung diseases (3 cases
each of sarcoidosis and collagen vascular lung disease; 2 cases each
of interstitial pneumonitis, hypersensitive pneumonitis, and eo-
sinophilic pneumonia; and 1 case each of bronchiolitis obliterans
organizing pneumonia and lung cancer), and 53 normal subjects.
Diagnosis of PAP was based on biochemical analysis of BALF
and histopathological findings of lung biopsy. The I-PAP patients
had no history of hematological disorders, infectious diseases, or

toxic inhalation. Two S-PAP patients were in the blast phase of
chronic myelogenous leukemia. 5 of 11 I-PAP patients, 1 of 2
S-PAP patients, and 30 normal subjects underwent venipuncture
to obtain sera at various periods after bronchoalveolar lavage.
Written informed consent to participate in this study was ob-
tained from all subjects.
Cytokines, Antibodies, and a Cell Line.
Recombinant human
(rh)GM-CSF was provided by Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd. (Taka-
saki, Japan), and 125I–Bolton Hunter–labeled rhGM-CSF was
purchased from NEN Life Science Products. rhIL-3 was pur-
chased from R & D Systems, Inc. Biotinylated or nonlabeled rat
anti–human GM-CSF mAb (BVD2-21C11 and BVD2-23B6,
respectively) was purchased from PharMingen. Peroxidase-
labeled rabbit anti–human IgA, -D, -E, -G, and -M polyclonal
antibodies were purchased from DAKO Corp. A GM-CSF– or
IL-3–dependent cell line, TF-1 (12), was provided by Dr. Kita-
mura (The Institute of Medical Science, The University of
Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan).
Blot Assay with 125I–GM-CSF.
Proteins in BALF or sera
were subjected to SDS-PAGE using gradient gel (2–15%) under
nonreducing conditions at 30 mA constant current for 150 min.
Separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a poly-
vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane at 12 V constant voltage
for 75 min. The membrane was fixed with 10% (vol/vol) acetic
acid and 50% (vol/vol) methanol, stained with Coomassie bril-
liant blue solution, washed with methanol, and treated with a
blocking reagent (PBS supplemented with 1% [wt/vol] BSA and
0.1% [vol/vol] Tween 20) overnight at 48C. The membrane was
then incubated with 0.16 nM 125I–GM-CSF for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing, the membrane was exposed to x-ray
film for 4 d.
Competition Assay of GM-CSF Binding to the mAb in ELISA.
The method of this assay was described previously (11). In brief,
after coating a micro-ELISA plate with anti–human GM-CSF
mAb (BVD2-23B6), rhGM-CSF and BALF were incubated in
the wells. rhGM-CSF bound to BVD2-23B6 antibody was de-
tected using biotinylated anti–human GM-CSF mAb (BVD2-
21C11) and streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
Color was developed using tetramethylbenzidine, and the absor-
bance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrometer
(model 3550; Bio-Rad Labs.). Binding activity was calculated
with the following equation: binding activity 5 1 2 detected
GM-CSF (ng/ml)/applied GM-CSF (ng/ml).
Purification of the GM-CSF Binding Protein.
BALF was centri-
fuged at 1,000 g for 5 min. To remove lipoid materials, the super-
natant was mixed vigorously with an equal volume of 1-butanol,
and the mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min. After re-
moving the butanol layer, the procedure was repeated. The aque-
ous layer was dialyzed against 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH
7.0, and lyophilized. Delipidated BALF was purified by using Hi-
Trap SP column, a cation exchange column (equilibrated with
20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, and eluted with a linear so-
dium chloride gradient); HiTrap Q column, an anion exchange
column (equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and eluted
with a linear sodium chloride gradient); Superose 12 column, a
gel filtration column (equilibrated with PBS containing 0.1%
[vol/vol] NP-40 and eluted with the same buffer); RESOURCE
Q column, an anion exchange column (equilibrated with 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and eluted with a linear sodium chloride gra-
dient); and RESOURCE S column, a cation exchange column
(equilibrated with 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, and
eluted with a linear sodium chloride gradient). All of these col-
umns were from Pharmacia Biotech.
Purification of Igs.
Delipidated BALF was applied on recombi-
nant protein A affinity column (Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated
with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Ig bound to the column
was eluted by pH gradient (pH 3.0–7.0).
NH2-terminal Sequencing of Protein.
NH2-terminal 
sequenc-
ing of protein was performed by the phenyl isothiocyanate
method using the HP G1005A NH2-terminal protein sequencing
system (Hewlett-Packard Bioscience Products).
Antigen Capture Assay to Determine the Isotype of the Antibody.
Various concentrations of Ig purified from BALF of an I-PAP pa-
tient (39–5,000 ng/ml) were transferred to micro-ELISA plates
coated with 1 mg/ml rhGM-CSF, and the plate was kept at room
temperature for 1 h. After washing, 0.3 mg/ml of peroxidase-
labeled anti–human IgA, -D, -E, -G, or -M polyclonal antibody
was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h.
Color was developed using tetramethylbenzidine, and the absor-
bance was measured at 450 nm.
3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide As-
say.
The method of this assay was described previously (13). In
brief, TF-1 cells (2 3 104 cells/well) were incubated for 3 d with
1 ng/ml of rhGM-CSF or rhIL-3 and 1 mg/ml of Igs purified
from BALF of an I-PAP patient. To the culture, 5 mg/ml
of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT; Sigma Chemical Co.) was added and incubated. After
formation of formazan crystals, isopropanol/HCl was added to
dissolve the crystal, and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm.

Results
Occurrence of GM-CSF Binding Factor in BALF.
Occur-
rence of the GM-CSF binding factor in BALF supernatant
was studied from 80 donors, including 11 I-PAP patients.
As shown in Fig. 1, blot assay with 125I–GM-CSF gave a
single band with a molecular mass of 180 kD in all I-PAP
cases examined. In contrast, no band was detected in S-PAP
patients, normal subjects, or patients with other lung
diseases such as sarcoidosis, collagen vascular lung disease,
interstitial pneumonitis, hypersensitive pneumonitis, and
eosinophilic pneumonia.
Purification and Characterization of the GM-CSF Binding
Factor.
The binding factor in BALF was purified by cat-
ion- and anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration
chromatography (Fig. 2 A). For evaluation of binding ac-
tivity, a competition assay of GM-CSF binding to the mAb
(BVD2-23B6) in ELISA was used. The purified protein
showed a single band of 180 kD on SDS-PAGE under
nonreducing conditions and two bands of 28 and 57 kD
under reducing conditions (Fig. 2 B). 125I–GM-CSF bind-
ing to the purified 180-kD protein was confirmed by blot
assay (Fig. 2 C), and bound 125I–GM-CSF was released
when treated with citrate buffer, pH 2.0 (data not shown).
The GM-CSF Binding Factor Is an Antibody against the Cy-
tokine.
The 57-kD band was electroblotted onto a PVDF
membrane and sequenced directly. The NH2-terminal se-
quence of the 57-kD protein was EVQLVESGGG-
LVQPGGSLRL, identical to the NH2-terminal sequence
of human Ig H chain. The data suggest that the GM-CSF
binding protein in the BALF is an antibody. To show that
the binding factor is actually an antibody, Ig in BALF from
an I-PAP patient was isolated using a recombinant protein
A column. Ig eluted from the column by changing pH gra-
dient showed 125I–GM-CSF binding activity (Fig. 2 D).
Specificity of binding to GM-CSF was demonstrated by ef-
fective competition of 125I–GM-CSF binding with nonra-
dioactive GM-CSF (Fig. 2 E). 125I–GM-CSF binding ac-
tivity was not affected by the presence of nonspecific
human Ig (data not shown).
Bioactivity of the Isolated Ig.
To confirm the bioactivity
of isolated Ig, its inhibitory effect on growth of the TF-1
cell line was examined using the MTT assay. Growth of
TF-1 cells is dependent on either GM-CSF or IL-3. The Ig
purified from BALF inhibited GM-CSF–dependent
growth of TF-1 cells but not IL-3–dependent growth (Fig.
3). The results indicate that the antibody inhibits growth of
this cell line by neutralizing the bioactivity of GM-CSF.
The Isotype of the Autoantibody.
The isotype of the anti-
body was determined by antigen capture assay. The Ig cap-
tured by GM-CSF reacted with only anti–human IgG,
whereas no other antiisotype antibody reacted, indicating
that the isotype of the antibody is IgG (data not shown).
Presence of the Autoantibody in the Serum.
To know whether
the I-PAP patients have circulating antibody against GM-
CSF, we performed a blot assay with 125I–GM-CSF of sera
from 36 donors, including 5 I-PAP patients, 1 S-PAP patient,
and 30 normal subjects who underwent bronchoalveolar la-
vage during this study. Serum samples from all I-PAP pa-
tients showed a single 180-kD band, whereas no such band
was detected in samples from the S-PAP patient and nor-
mal subjects (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the band was observed

Autoantibody against GM-CSF in Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis
even in those from three patients who had entered remis-
sion and whose chest x-rays showed no opacity at the time
of study. The isotype of the antibody in sera was also IgG
(data not shown). These results indicate that the antibody is
not limited to the lung but exists systemically in I-PAP pa-
tients.
Discussion
We have shown in this paper that autoantibody against
GM-CSF is present in the lungs and sera of I-PAP patients
but not in those of S-PAP patients, normal subjects, or pa-
tients with other lung diseases. Because GM-CSF is a key
factor for maintaining the differentiation and proliferation
of macrophages, dysfunction of AMs due to the neutraliza-
tion of GM-CSF bioactivity by an autoantibody is a plausi-
ble explanation for the pathogenesis of human I-PAP. In
fact, AMs from patients with active acquired PAP are
known to be functionally impaired (14, 15). Furthermore,
one type of congenital PAP was known to be associated
with a defect of the GM-CSF receptor, and in murine
models, knockout of the gene for GM-CSF or its receptor
induced PAP-like disease. The disease in these murine
models was corrected by transgenic expression of GM-CSF
in the pulmonary epithelia or bone marrow transplantation
from wild-type mice (16, 17).
It is increasingly understood that sera in some healthy
and diseased individuals contain autoantibodies against cy-
tokines. Natural antibodies have been reported against rh
IL-1b, IL-2, IL-8, and TNF-a (18–21). Most of these au-
toantibodies were neutralizing antibodies and interfered
with the binding of cytokines to receptors by simple com-
petition (19–21). Recently, it was reported that anti–GM-
CSF autoantibody was frequently detected in pharmaceuti-
cally prepared human IgG (22) and that 0.3–2% of sera had
a low titer of anti–GM-CSF antibody (22, 23). However, it
was not reported that autoantibody against GM-CSF is as-
sociated with any disease or symptoms. Our results strongly
suggest that I-PAP is an autoimmune disease with neutral-
izing autoantibody against the cytokine. As mentioned
above, previous work in the patient case report and in mice
has established that impaired production or action of GM-
CSF can cause PAP. It is, therefore, reasonable to ascribe
causality to the presence of autoantibody in the cases pre-
sented here, frequently and solely in the patients with I-PAP.
This is, therefore, the first disease for which it can be ar-
gued that the cause is an autoantibody to a cytokine.
It is not clear at the time of this writing why autoanti-
body is generated in I-PAP patients. One possibility is that
the autoantibody was provoked by a cross-reactive antigen,
possibly from infectious pathogen(s). Alternatively, the au-
toantibody was generated to endogenously regulate GM-
CSF bioactivity.
Although the functional consequences are predomi-
nantly manifest within the lung, our data suggest that the
pathophysiologic disorder of I-PAP may originate from the
systemic generation of autoantibody against GM-CSF. In
this regard, recent clinical trials of GM-CSF administration
to acquired PAP are intriguing (24). The hematopoietic
response to GM-CSF in the patients was attenuated. The
impaired response was not due to altered expression of
GM-CSF receptor on PBMCs. It is possible that the ad-
ministrated GM-CSF was neutralized by anti–GM-CSF
antibody before it reached the target organs.
Finally, our observations have therapeutic implications.
Whole lung lavage provides temporary remission in most
cases, but additional lavage is required in more than 50% of
patients (25). Measurement of the autoantibody in the lung
after whole lung lavage may identify patients who require
further therapy or who have risk for recurrence.
