The clinical course of a young woman following two separate suicide attempts using the herbicide paraquat
is reported. The patient survived an intramuscular injection of paraquat almost asymptomatically, but later
exhibited a typical fatal course with fulminant proliferative pulmonary fibrosis after an intravenous injection.
Fibrosis and death occurred despite a therapeutic regimen based upon a known action of paraquat, the
generation of superoxide (02.-), using superoxide dismutase, a-tocopherol, and ascorbic acid in conjunction
with forced diuresis and prednisone. While treatment failed explanations for the failure of therapy in this case
and current therapeutic alternatives are discussed so that they may be considered when future cases are
encountered.
Paraquat (methyl viologen, 1, 1'- dimethyl-4,4'-dipyridylium dichloride) is a herbi-
cide which has been responsible for 564 deaths reported to the manufacturer since its
introduction in 1958. An estimated 60% of these fatalities were successful suicides.
An episode of transient pulmonary edema with kidney and liver dysfunction are often
the first symptoms, but they do not ordinarily appear until a day or more after
paraquat ingestion. Death usually occurs after one or more weeks and most often is
the result of a relentless, fulminant pulmonary fibrosis which is not clinically signifi-
cant for the first week or longer.
The precise mechanism of the tissue damage produced by paraquat is unknown,
but the evidence implicates the reduction products of oxygen as shown in Fig. 1. By
accepting electrons from NADPH, cytochrome c reductase [1] and possibly glutath-
ione reductase [2], among others, paraquat can act as an oxidation-reduction couple.
Reduced paraquat very rapidly reduces molecular oxygen to its toxic free radical,
superoxide (02..) (Fig. IA) [3]. Superoxide may produce tissue injury by reacting
directly with cellular components or by generating other very reactive species of
oxygen such as hydroxyl radical (OH-) and singlet oxygen (102) by the Haber-Weiss
reaction [4] (Fig. 1 B). Beyond the peroxidation of lipids, and perhaps thiol oxidation,
the particular consequences of these species of oxygen in tissues are not well de-
scribed. The mechanism of toxicity of any of these species of oxygen is not known.
While gastrointestinal absorption may be prevented by the administration of
bentonite or Fuller's earth [5], no method exists to limit paraquat absorption from
parenteral sites. Tissue binding is rapid and lung even concentrates the compound
[6]. Dialysis has not been particularly effective and has shown no advantage over

efforts must be devised and directed toward the prevention of tissue injury and the
ultimate fibrosis.
We report the results of therapy in a case of paraquat poisoning after two suicide
attempts, first by intramuscular then by intravenous injection of the compound. The
treatment regimen used was designed to interfere with the consequence of superoxide
(02.-) production by paraquat. While some data concerning the efficiency of similar
regimens exist in experimental animals, no published information is available for
man.
REPORT OF A CASE
Following the intramuscular injection of about 60 mg of a commercial preparation
of the herbicide paraquat into her anterior thighs, a 24-year-old woman was referred
for treatment to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. She had attempted
suicide many times before, both by self-mutilation and by a variety of drug inges-
tions. Her history also included frequent episodes of severe asthma, gastrointestinal
bleeding from stress ulcers, obesity, schizophrenia, and recent deep vein thrombosis
with a documented pulmonary embolus four years previously.
Upon admission the patient complained of abdominal discomfort and had a fever
of 102.00 F. Her physical examination and laboratory tests were unremarkable except
for blood gases which were consistent with her chronic asthma (pH 7.47, PO2 89
mmHg, pCO2 32 mmHg and HCO323 meq/ 1). During this hospitalization a painful
erythematous area 4-5 cm in diameter appeared at the injection sites. She developed
leukocytosis 20,000 per mm3 by the fourth hospital day and a low grade fever. No
microorganisms were cultured from the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, or blood; her chest
x-ray was unremarkable.
Treatment included forced diuresis (680-5075 ml urine output per day) to promote
paraquat excretion and ascorbic acid 6.0 grams per day to provide a source of
reducing equivalents to allay the oxidizing effect of paraquat. Oral dicloxicillin and
probenicid were given to treat a possible staphyloccal cellulitis at the injection site.
She returned to the referring hospital on the sixth hospital day and continued to
recover uneventfully.
Thirty days after the first paraquat injection the patient procured a commercial
paraquat preparation, and injected 2 ml intravenously (550-600 mg). Upon confess-
ing her suicide attempt the next morning she was transferred to the medical service
482
PARAQUAT TOXICITY: THERAPY AGAINST SUPEROXIDE
where therapy was started with a forced diuresis (4000-8000 ml per day) and ascorbic
acid,
1 gm four times daily. She complained of episgastic cramping with nausea and
vomiting.
Physical examination revealed an occasional respiratory wheeze, moderate ankle
edema, and erythematous areas at the sites of the previous paraquat injections.
Sixteen hours after injection paraquat was not detectable in serum but was found in
the urine. By day 3 she was excreting 4 mg of paraquat per day (Table 1). By the
fourth hospital day she developed signs of hepatic and renal toxicity. The creatinine
rose to a value of 3.7 mg% on the seventh hospital day, then returned to 0.9 to 1.1
mg% over the next several days. She complained of right upper quadrant pain; the
serum lactic dehydrogenase rose to 1300 IU/l serum analine tranasaminase (SGOT)
level to 92 IU/1 and serum asparate transaminase (SGPT) level .to 94 IU/1. Bilirubin
and prothrombin time remained normal. The patient developed fever (100.000) and
leukocytosis (20,500) per mm3 on the seventh day without definitive proof of bacterial
infection until late in the hospital course.
Ninety hours after the paraquat injection, therapy specifically directed against the
consequence of superoxide radical generation was begun. A supply of the enzyme
superoxide dismutase was obtained first as the bovine enzyme (Palosein, Diagnostic
Data,
Inc., Mountain View, California), then as the human enzyme (Ontosein,
Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, N.J.). After obtaining informed
consent it was administered at a dose of 5 mg every three hours intramuscularly.
Ascorbic acid was raised to 8 gm per day in divided doses and 544 IU a-tocopherol
was given intramuscularly twice daily in an attempt to inhibit membrane lipid
oxidation. Finally, 20 mg methyl prednisone was given four times daily in an attempt
to retard the inflammatory reaction and its potential contribution to the expected
pulmonary fibrosis.
Despite this therapy her pulmonary status continued to deteriorate and she was
transferred 18 hrs later to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a P02 of 31 mmHg,
pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 32 mmHg, and HCO3 of 15.2 meq/I. A chest x-ray showed a
diffuse bilateral interstitial process consistent with edema. Pulmonary arterial pres-
sure was measured at 45/30 mmHg with a wedge pressure of 5-7 cm. She responded
to intubation, 100% 02, and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm by
raising her P02 to 66 mmHg. Over the ensuing seven days her fractional inspired
oxygen (FI02) and PEEP were gradually reduced from 50% and 15 cm to 30% and 0
cm respectively, in order to administer only enough O2 to maintain adequate peri-
pheral oxygenation, without accelerating the pulmonary toxicity of paraquat. Accor-
dingly she was maintained relatively hypoxic (pO2 35-80 mmHg). She also received
digoxin, furosemide and theophylline to control volume overload from the forced
diuresis, and bronchoconstriction. Ampicillin was given for a possible E. coli pneu-
monia. Urinary excretion of paraquat rose progressively (Table 1) reaching a peak
value of 22 mgm/24 hr period two days before death. Pulmonary deterioration
continued however and on the 20th hospital day she expired, unable to maintain her
P02 above 30 mmHg, despite 100% HO2 and 20 cmPEEP.
At autopsy the lungs were diffusely involved with a pneumonic process with the
most dependent portions of the lower lobes less affected. The alveolar spaces were
obliterated by florid fibrosis, characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts with loose,
light stained collagen. No hyaline membranes were present. The capillaries were
patent with the endothelial cell lining preserved. The bronchiolar and alveolar ducts
were dilated, and many were filled with red cells as well as numerous hemosiderin-

pulmonary vasculature was normal (Figs. 2 and 3). No significant abnormalities were
seen in the remaining organs.
Tissue levels of paraquat found at autopsy are indicated in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
This patient recovered completely from an intramuscular injection of paraquat
only to succumb to a much larger intravenous dose, despite intensive therapeutic
efforts. The nearly asymptomatic response to the intramuscular dose is not surprising
since muscle binds paraquat, and tissue levels decrease much more slowly in muscle
than elsewhere [8,9]. The intravenous dose, however, exhibited the typical course in
paraquat poisoning and was not, therefore, apparently influenced by the previous
exposure.
The usual clinical course following a fatal dose of paraquat is reflected in this case.
Immediately after taking the poison, nausea and vomiting are the only significant
symptoms. A few days later, multisystem toxicity with pulmonary edema, kidney
failure, and liver dysfunction follow, all of which improve after a few days to a week.
Although an occasional patient recovers completely [7,10], most develop pulmonary
distress, become hypoxic, require oxygen therapy, and soon die with fulminant
irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. The histological picture seen in sections of the
patient's lung is typical of that observed in other fatal cases.
Since nausea and vomiting are found in parenteral as well as oral poisonings [7,11],
these symptoms are produced by more than the very high concentrations which are in
contact with the gastric mucosa after ingestion. Leucocytosis and fever were also seen
after both parenteral doses in this case and have been commonly found in previous
oral cases [11,12]. The mechanism of these reactions remains unexplained although
tissue necrosis may play a role.
Throughout this patient's hospital course she excreted significant quantities of
paraquat, a total of approximately 280 mg (Table 1). This high urine output of
paraquat would be expected to reflect large tissue stores; however, this was not the
case among the tissues assayed (Table 2). From the tissue levels the maximal body
burden at death would be much less than 3.0 mg. This data would seem to contradict
the urinary levels. To be consistent, either the tissue stores of paraquat must have
been exhausted just previous to death, or paraquat must have been sequestered in a
tissue which was not available for analysis such as muscle, liver; or skin. Since
paraquat excretion is usually biphasic with large quantities excreted within the first
twenty-four hours, recovery of an estimated 265 mg of paraquat after the first day is
roughly consistent with a total body burden of 550-600 mg paraquat, the amount
originally injected intravenously.

PARAQUAT TOXICITY: THERAPY AGAINST SUPEROXIDE
FIG. 2. Diffuse intraalveolar fibrosis (Trichrome lOX).
Therapy in this case was based upon the hypothesis that the generation of superox-
ide, a known action of paraquat, was also its toxic action, especially in lung. This
hypothesis is supported by the dependence of paraquat toxicity on inspired oxygen
concentrations [13,14], the finding that superoxide dismutase has a protective effect
in paraquat poisoned rats [15], and the similarity of the pulmonary histologic
changes seen in oxygen poisoning to those in paraquat poisoning [4]. Superoxide
dismutase was given to supplement endogenous superoxide dismutase in order to
prevent superoxide from reacting in ways harmful to the cell. Although toxicity
studies are not complete, the enzyme has no presently known toxicity [16]. a -
tocopherol is a lipid phase antioxidant which protects against lipid peroxidation, a
potential consequence of superoxide [4]. In paraquat poisoned rats lipid peroxida-
tion is increased and paraquat is much more toxic in a-tocopherol deficient rats [1].
Ascorbic acid was used to provide aqueous phase reducing equivalents in both the
intracellular and extracellular fluid spaces. No reports of the use of such a treatment
regimen in man have been published.
There are a number of possible reasons for the failure of the treatment approach in
this case. First, the specific therapy was not started until nearly four days after the
injection. Certainly by this time extensive, possibly irreversible, damage had oc-
curred. Second, there is no information available on the appropriate dosages of these
compounds to use in paraquat poisoning or other analogous situations. However the
Michealis constant of superoxide dismutase [18] is, most certainly, much greater than
the concentration of superoxide. Thus, even in the presence of paraquat additional
enzyme might not have a significant effect; nevertheless a protective effect of the
enzyme in paraquat poisoned rats has been observed [15]. Third, it has been shown

recently that the lung actively concentrates paraquat [6]. Since administered superox-
ide dismutase presumably remains in the extracellular space, it may not effectively
protect intracellular sites of paraquat action. Fourth, oxygen therapy was required to
maintain peripheral otygenation. Since increasing the fractional oxygen content of
inspired air aggravates paraquat injury of lung [13], oxygen therapy, although
necessary to maintain life, may have resulted in much more extensive paraquat
mediated lung injury. Fifth, it is possible that superoxide is not directly involved in
paraquat toxicity in man. Data from studies with E. coli suggest mechanisms other
than superoxide may be responsible for injury in these organisms [19]. This may
represent a second unrelated toxic action of these compounds which is not amenable
to treatment directed at dissipation of the superoxide anion.
In future cases of paraquat poisoning other therapeutic possibilities should also be
considered. Hemoperfusion, over activated charcoal or a cation exchange resin has
reduced serum paraquat concentrations in experimental animals [20]. Paraquat is
inactivated by bentonite or Fuller's earth; and gastric lavage and passage of these
agents can be a life-saving measure in some cases. Experimental animals have been
protected from an otherwise lethal dose with administration of bentonite as long as
ten hours after paraquat ingestion [21]. They may also be beneficial when paraquat is
taken by other routes. Steroids and cytotoxic agents have been used without marked
success [7]; however, a recovery from the proliferative pulmonary fibrosis of para-
quat poisoning as well as two therapeutic failures have been recently reported with
azathioprine and potassium amino benzoate [10,22,23].

Currently no therapy for paraquat poisoning is uniformily successful and almost
all repeated cases have resulted in a fatal outcome even after ingestion of relatively
small amounts of the compound [24]. Ideal treatment would inhibit the proliferative
pulmonary fibrosis while permitting the recovery of other pulmonary cell types. Until
such a therapy is described we are left with absorption, diuresis, or dialysis of
paraquat in an effort to recover the compound before irreversible damage is done. To
judge whether antioxidants such as those employed in the present case can be of
benefit in paraquat poisoning must await a larger sample of reported cases. Further-
more, to enhance any opportunity for success they should be administered as
promptly as possible after poisoning occurs to possibly prevent irreversible damage.

Summary.-Concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (FU) were measured in the plasma of
patients receiving i.v. infusions of the drug for 5 days as treatment for adenocar-
cinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Concentrations of FU varied widely in many
patients. Concentration of drug x time of infusion (C x t values) were calculated.
Patients showing a partial response or stabilization of disease had significantly
higher C x t values than non-responders. Methyl CCNU did not affect the C x t
values of FU. Determination of the plasma concentration of FU would allow the dose
of the drug to be adjusted to maintain high concentrations of FU in the plasma. Our
data suggest that such high concentrations would increase the response rate in this
disease.
THE RESPONSE of adenocarcinoma of the
gastrointestinal tract to treatment with
FU is less when the drug is given orally
than i.v. (Hahn
et al.,
1975). Also, the
various regimens used for i.v. treatment
produce
different
response
rates
(Ans-
field
et
al.,
1977).
Of these
regimens,
continuous infusion of drug for 5 days is
the least toxic (Seifert et al., 1975) and,
when combined with other drugs, gives
good
clinical responses
(Woolley
et
al.,
1976). Some data are available on the
plasma
concentrations
of FU after i.v.
injection
or oral administration
(Cohen
et al., 1974), but only one other published
study (Clarkson et al., 1964) besides our
preliminary report (Kawai
et
al.,
1977)
gives data on plasma concentrations of
drug
during
continuous
i.v.
infusion.
These concentrations varied widely in the
same
patient during
infusion,
and the
values
of
drug
concentration x time
varied widely between different patients.
The present study was
carried out
to
determine whether these drug concentra-
tions
related
to
tumour
response
and
whether
the
administration
of methyl
CCNU on Day
1 of the infusion altered
the plasma concentrations of FU.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Selection ofpatients and treatment schedule.-
Patients with measurable metastatic adeno-
carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract who
had
not
received
FU
or
methyl CCNTU
previously were treated by i.v. infusion of
FU, 1-2 g/m2/day (not > 2 g) in 1 1 of 5%
dextrose for 5 days. Infusion was either by
gravity or with a Holter pump, on a non-
random
basis.
Infusions
were
routinely
supervised in a general medical ward. Some
patients received methyl CCNU 150 mg/M2
by
mouth
on Day
1.
Treatments
were
repeated
at
intervals
of 6
weeks,
unless
severe drug toxicity or progression of disease
occurred. Plasma levels of FU were deter-
mined during one or more of these courses.

not affecting food intake,

if preventing
intake of solid but not soft and liquid food,
and 3 if preventing intake of anything by
mouth.
Haematological
toxicity
was
not
evaluated, as the patients were discharged
from hospital at the time a fall in white cells
and platelets would have occurred. More-
over, this form of toxicity is infrequent and
asymptomatic when FU is given by continu-
ous infusion at the dosage used (Seifert et al.,
1975).
A complete response was defined as the
disappearance of all disease; partial response
was the objective response as described by
Seifert et al. (1975); stabilization of disease
was defined as no increase in the size of
measurable lesions and no appearance of new
lesions and no deterioration in laboratory
tests over a period of 60 days, or cases which
did not fulfil the requirements for a partial
response; progression of disease occurred if
there was objective evidence of progression,
seen as an increase in the size of metastatic
lesions or the appearance of new lesions or
increasingly abnormal values in laboratory
tests.

Determination of plasma levels of FU.-Five
ml of blood wvas taken from Patients 5, 6, 10
and 11 from 8 to 11 times, at varying inter-

II give the drug levels for patients treated
by gravity and pump infusion respectively.
C x t values
were calculated from the
area under curves such as those in Fig. 1.
These
values
are shown
in Table
III.
Patients 5, 9 and 24 had 2 infusions each,
and the average of these values was used
for statistical analyses. For a distribution
plot, C x t values were grouped in ranges
of 5 units:
0-5,
5-10
etc.
Fig.
2
is
a
distribution
of C x t
values.
For
all
27 patients (Table III), the mean C x t
value was 24-2 units (mg h FU/ml), the
median,
15*9 ui and the mode
(Fig.
2),
10-15 u. Patients showing toxicity to FU
had a mean C x t value of 193 u and a
median value of 14-5 u; non-toxic patients
had a mean of 27-6 u and a median value
of
17 7 u.
Patients
showing
a
partial
response
or stabilization of disease had
mean values of 36*1 u and a median value
of 29*9 u, and non-responders a mean of
19-2 u and a median of 15*8 u. Inspection
of the data (Fig.
2) also indicates that
responding patients (PR and S) had higher
C x t
values
than
non-responding
patients (NR), while toxic patients (Ti,
T2, T3) did not have high C x t values.
Statistical analysis
was
carried out by
not assuming
a normal
distribution
of
values, since Fig. 2 shows skewing on the
right. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test (Dixon &
Massey,
1969)
was
therefore
used and
gave a probability of 0 05 (2-tailed) that
the
difference
between
responders and
non-responders occurred by chance. The

DISCUSSION
The drug
5-fluorouracil
remains
the
most
effective
single
agent
in
chemo-
therapy of adenocarinoma of the gastro-
3OAT ET AL.
intestinal tract, and is used in combina-
tion chemotherapy for this disease. Never-
theless, we do not know the best method
and
schedule
of
administration.
Some
studies indicate that an i.v. loading dose of
FU gives the best response (Ansfield et al.,
1977)
while
others
suggest
that
i.v.
infusion for 5 days with or without other
drugs increases the frequency of response
and may increase survival (Grillo-Lopez
et at., 1977; Buroker et al., 1977). Objective
responses obtained by the Eastern Co-
operative Oncology Group were 6% at a
dose of 7-5 mg/kg, 20% at 15 mg/kg and
25% at 20 mg/kg (Horton et al., 1970).
Increasing the dose of FU during a 24h
infusion, repeated in 1 or 2 weeks, allows
high
doses
of drug
(up
to
16 g/24 h
infusion) to be given with regression and
stasis of large refractory tumours (Spiers
et al., 1977). This dependence of response
on
dose
suggests
that
response
may
correlate with the plasma concentration
of the drug, in spite of the complex bio-

chemical and kinetic
steps involved
in
the ultimate action of FU on the tumour
cell. In a similar way, high plasma con-
centrations
of methotrexate
after large
doses of the drug produce responses in
tumours resistant to lower plasma
con-
centrations. Plasma levels of FU are also
important when the drug is given with
thymidine.
Phase
I
studies have
then
shown marked elevation and prolongation
of FU levels in the plasma, with increased
marrow toxicity compared to FU alone
(Vogel et al., 1978). The enhanced tumour
effect
reported
in
animals
given
this
combination
(Martin
et
al.,
1978)
may
result from the high level of FU main-
tained over a considerable period of time.
However, the action of the drug under
these
conditions
may
be
qualitatively
different from
that when
the
drug
is
given alone (Nayak et al., 1978).
Our results indicate a positive correla-
tion between plasma levels of drug and
tumour response. Gudauskas and Goldie
(1978) have recently presented data show-
ing a similar correlation and confirming
the variability we observe. Since FU given
as an infusion is less toxic to the marrow
than when given as a single i.v. injection
(Seifert et al., 1975) successive treatments
by infusion
could
use increasing doses
as needed to maintain a level of drug at
or above 36-1 C X t units, the mean value
for responders in our series.
Methyl CCNU
did
not
alter plasma
concentrations
of FU,
so the reported
synergism of this agent with FU (Moertel
et al., 1975) is not due to changed plasma
concentrations of the latter drug.
Plasma concentrations of FU fluctuated
more widely with gravity infusion than
with pump infusion,
as expected. These
concentrations reflect the short half-life
(an
a, phase of 12 min) of the drug in the
plasma (Kirkwood & Frei, 1978).
Our data indicate that
an increased
rate of response may result if the plasma
concentration of FU were used to adjust
the dose of drug administered. Combined
with the method of predicting marrow
toxicity which
we
reported
previously
(Hillcoat et al., 1977) this approach may
allow
an optimum
and
individualized
use of FU.

Bacteremia due to Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium
or Lactobacillus; Twenty-one Cases
and Review of the Literature
KATHLEEN A. BOURNE, JAMES L. BEEBE, YVONNE A. LUE,
AND PAUL D. ELLNER
Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons
New York, New York
Received April 17, 1978
Twenty-one cases of bacteremia due to Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium and Lactobacillus are described.
Transient bacteremic episodes with these organisms may follow trauma to the mouth, intestine, or vagina.
The majority of the patients were female and most had an underlying condition that may have predisposed
to bacteremia. Ten of the patients died despite antibiotic treatment.
INTRODUCTION
Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus species are all non-sporeforming
gram-positive rods that are classified as anaerobes. Species vary from strictly
anaerobic to aerotolerant. These genera are taxonomically unrelated, but they are all
non-motile and lack catalase. Their microscopic morphology includes straight or
curved rods (Lactobacillus), pleomorphic rods (Eubacterium), and branched or
bifurcated forms (Bifidobacterium).
Species of all three genera are found among the commensal flora of man. Since
these organisms are usually recovered together with other commensals, little is
known of their pathogenic potential.
The present paper describes the recovery of these species, usually in pure culture,
from the blood of patients with a variety of clinical problems.
METHODS
Subjects
Blood cultures were obtained from adult patients at the Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center during the period 1972 to 1977. In every case, the blood was drawn
the same day on which the provocative signs or symptoms occurred, usually within a
few hours after a temperature rise.
Blood Sampling Procedure
The patient's antecubital fossa was prepared with either 2% tincture of iodine or
PVP-Jodine (Betadine solution, Purdue-Frederick Co.) and approximately 17 ml of

blood was collected into Vacutainer tubes containing sodium polyanethol sulfonate
(Becton-Dickinson).
Laboratory Procedures
The blood was distributed between two bottles, one of which contained modified
Columbia broth [1,2]. This bottle was vented to provide aerobic conditions. The
second bottle contained modified Columbia broth made hypertonic with 10% sucrose
[3]. This bottle remained unvented to maintain anaerobic conditions. Aerobic bottles
were subcultured to chocolate agar at 10 hours and at 5 days; anaerobic bottles were
subcultured to anaerobic blood agar at 5 days [3]. Gram stains were performed on all
isolates, and gram-positive isolates were tested for catalase production. Anaerobic or
microaerophilic non-sporeforming gram-positive rods were identified by fermenta-
tion in prereduced media (Scott Labs) or with the Minitek System (Bioquest) and
with gas liquid chromatography according to the criteria of the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute [4].
Data Analysis
Patients' charts were reviewed to determine the history, presence of underlying
disease, and other pertinent clinical information.
RESULTS
During the 6-year period of this study, 91,493 blood cultures were received. More
than 9,000 isolates were recovered, 10% of which were anaerobes. Ten Bifidobac-
terium species, 8 Eubacterium species, and 4 Lactobacillus species were recovered
among these approximately 900 anaerobic isolates. Blood cultures became positive
3-5 days after incubation. These organisms were not recovered from any other site or
specimen.
Ten Bifidobacterium isolates were obtained from 9 patients. Blood from 2 of the
patients (Nos.
5 and 6) grew out a second organism: Bacteroides fragilis and
Peptostreptococcus species. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 60 years. Five of
these patients had complications associated with pregnancy; 2 patients had gastroin-
testinal disorders; and 2 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, one of whom
developed peritonitis. Two of the patients died (Table 1).
Nine Eubacterium isolates were obtained from 8 patients. The same blood culture
from 2 of the patients (Nos. 10 and 12) grew out a second organism: Klebsiella
pneumoniae and Bacteroides species. Other blood cultures from patient No. 10 grew
out Arizona, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides
fragilis. Separate blood cultures from patient No. 13 grew out Proteus vulgaris and
Nocardia asteroides. A single blood culture from patient No. 14 grew out E. coli. The
patients ranged in age from 19 to 70 years. Seven of these patients had gastrointesti-
nal disorders and
1 patient developed fever following caesarean section. Six of the
patients died (Table 2).
Seven Lactobacillus isolates were obtained from 4 patients, all in pure culture. A
separate blood culture from patient No. 18 grew out Bacteroidesfragilis. The patients
ranged in age from 47 to 71 years. Two of the patients had gastrointestinal disease, 1
patient had endocarditis, and the remaining patient developed postoperative fever.
Two of the patients recovered (Table 3).
Antimicrobial susceptibility studies were not performed on any of the isolates.

DISCUSSION
Species of Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus are members of the
commensal flora of the mouth, vagina, and gastrointestinal tract [5]. Eubacterium
species have also been recovered from skin and the upper respiratory tract. Species of
Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus have been isolated from normal appendices [6]
and bifidobacteria have been found in the urine of 2 patients with indwelling
catheters [7].
All 3 genera have been implicated in obstetric and gynecologic infections [8-11]
and recovered from intraabdominal
abscesses [10,12,13].
Bifidobacterium and
Eubacterium
species
have
also been involved
in pleuropulmonary infections
[5,14-20].
The most common anaerobic gram-positive non-sporeforming rod recovered from
blood cultures
is Propionibacterium acnes.
In most cases the presence of this
organism represents contamination from the skin flora. A positive catalase reaction
serves to differentiate P. acnes from Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, and Lacto-
bacillus.
The recovery of anaerobic gram-positive non-sporeforming rods other than P.
acnes from blood cultures is rare. Our low rate of recovery-I per 3,500 blood
cultures-is comparable to the infrequent isolations reported by others [21-25]. The
explanation for the rarity of these organisms in bacteremia is far from clear. Possible
partial explanations include the failure to adequately culture blood for anaerobic
organisms, or the misidentification of isolates as P. acnes. One cannot relate the
infrequent recovery of these genera from blood to their numbers in the gastrointesti-
nal tract or other body sites, since all 3 genera are present in high concentrations.
Bifidobacterium species are numerically second only to Bacteroides in the gastroin-
testinal tract and are more numerous than Clostridium or anaerobic cocci [5] which
are recovered with considerably greater frequency. Similarly, Eubacterium species
are at least as abundant as clostridia or peptostreptococci. It would appear that
bifidobacteria, eubacteria, and lactobacilli are low in those virulence factors that
permit organisms to invade and multiply at sites other than their normal habitat.
Wilson [25] reported the recovery of a Bifidobacterium and a Eubacterium from a
patient with peritonitis. Lactobacilli [26-36] and eubacteria [37,38] have been shown
to be the etiologic agents of subacute bacterial endocarditis. Transient bacteremias
have also been reported with all 3 genera; bifidobacteria have been isolated following
genitourinary manipulation [39], eubacteria after oral prophylaxis [40], and lacto-
bacilli following a suction abortion [41].
It would appear that transient bacteremias due to these organisms may occur
following some disturbance of their ecologic niche; mouth, intestine, vagina. Trauma
may be associated with dental procedures; parturition or alteration in the integrity of
intestinal mucosa associated with diverticulosis, neoplasia, or perforation. None of
the infections was considered to be hospital-acquired.
Seventeen of the 21 patients in our series were female.
Almost all of the patients had some underlying condition that may have predis-
posed to their bacteremia. Five of the patients with Bifidobacterium and 1 patient
with Eubacterium had complications associated with pregnancy; 12 of the patients
had gastrointestinal disease, 2 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, and
1
patient had pre-existing valvular disease.
Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus species are generally susceptible
in vitro to clinically achievable levels of antibiotics such as penicillin, clindamycin,
510

chloramphenicol, and tetracycline which are commonly employed in treating anaer-
obic infections. All of the patients were treated before the results of the blood culture
were reported.
Ten of the 21 patients died despite antibiotic treatment. However, the bacteremia
was considered to be the terminal event in only one patient (No. 16) who developed
disseminated septic emboli and microabscesses.

Summary.-To investigate the association between medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid (MCT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), we assayed 78 sera from
patients with thyroid diseases for CEA, employing the radioimmunoassay of double
antibody technique.
All 13 sera from patients with MCT had high levels of CEA,
ranging from 14 to 170 ng/ml.
Increased serum CEA was noted .even in cases of
small, localized carcinoma.
By contrast, serum CEA levels were normal (below
10 ng/ml) in all other histological types of thyroid carcinoma (33 cases), except for
one case of papillary adenocarcinoma.
In 32 patients with non-malignant thyroid
diseases, with few exceptions serum CEA levels remained within the normal range.
The elevated serum levels of CEA in MCT returned to normal after successful
operation.
Furthermore, very high tissue concentrations of CEA were demonstrated
in MCT.
The results indicate that CEA is actively produced by MCT, and that its
measurement is useful in the diagnosis and management of the disease.
It is
suggested that the highly specific association of CEA with MCT may well be related
to a defect of neural crest origin.
MEDULLARY carcinoma of the thyroid
(MCT)
is known to secrete various bio-
active
substances
such
as
calcitonin,
serotonin, histaminase, etc., the unusual
properties
of
which
are
exploited
to
establish
early
diagnosis
in
high-risk
individuals
and
also
to
monitor
the
presence of metastatic disease following
surgical treatment (Melvin, Tashjian and
Miller, 1972). On the other hand, carcino-
embryonic
antigen
(CEA),
which
was
first found
in
colorectal
carcinoma by
Gold and Freedman (1965), is now con-
sidered to be a tumour-associated foetal
antigen lacking specificity for particular
tissues (Dykes and King, 1972; Laurence
and Neville, 1972a).
This paper describes
the presence of CEA at high concentra-
tions in sera and tumour tissues of MCT in
contrast with other histological types of
thyroid carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seventy-eight
sera were obtained from
patients with thyroid disease at the Thyroid
Clinic of the Departments of Internal Medi-
cine
II and Radiology, Kyoto University
Hospital.
In all patients a definite diagnosis
had been made by histological examination
together
with
routine
tests
of
thyroid
function
including
scintigraphy.
Blood
samples were withdrawn by venepuncture,
and the serum separated shortly thereafter
was stored at -20°C until use.
Radioimmunoassay
The
assay method
employed was
the
double
antibody
technique
of
nonequili-
brium system, modified from the methods
of Egan et
al. (1972) and Laurence
et al.
(1972b).
One hundred
,ul of serum sample
was mixed with 100 ,ul of 5% normal rabbit
serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
pH 7-4 and then with 100 ,ul of anti-CEA

University, Kyoto 606, Japan.

antiserum diluted 1: 12,000.
The mixture
was incubated at 37°C for 2 h, and then
100 pul of 1251-CEA solution (60,000 ct/min)
wN-as added.
After further incubation at 4°C
overnight,
100 pu
of 300'
goat anti-rabbit
IgG
antiserum
in PBS
was
also
added,
followed by incubation at 37°C for another
2 h.
The mixture was centrifuged at 3000
rev/min for 30 min, and the radioactivity of
the
precipitate measured
to
estimate
the
amount of CEA it contained.
The assay was
run in duplicate, and was capable of deter-
mining CEA in amounts from 4 to 250 ng/ml
with a standard deviation of + 1 ng/ml for
a mean value of 15 ng/ml.
The upper limit
of the normal range is 10 ng/ml.
The values
obtained (Y) were linearly proportional to
those by the zirconyl phosphate gel assay (X),
as expressed by
a regression equation
of
Y = 0*99X + 1-53.
Purified CEA was prepared from
per-
chloric acid extracts of colonic adenocarci-
noma
using
sequential
gel
filtration
on
Sepharose 4B and Sephadex G-200 followed
by
preparative
disc-gel
electrophoresis
(Hamada, Ishikawa and Yoshii, 1976).
The
preparations obtained were immunologically
indistinguishable from that of Gold (kindly
supplied by Dr P.
Gold).
The CEA was
labelled wNith 1251 by the chloramine T method.
Specific anti-CEA antiserum was prepared
after the method of Gold and Freedman
(1965) by immunizing rabbits with perchloric
acid extracts of the tumour,
followed by
absorption with normal sera and tissue ex-
tracts of colon, lung and liver.
RESULTS
Serum levels and positivities of CEA
in various types of thyroid carcinoma are
shown in Fig.
1 and Table
I.
All
13
patients with medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid (MCT) showed high levels of CEA,
averaging
84 ng/ml.
The
values
in
8
patients with metastases ranged from 14
to 170 ng/ml, averaging 97 ng/ml, while
those
in
5 patients without metastasis
ranged from 48 to 125 ng/ml, averaging
73 ng/ml.
By contrast, all 33 patients with other
histological types of thyroid carcinoma
showed normal levels of CEA except for
one
case
of papillary
adenocarcinoma.
In these diseases serum CEA remained
within
the
normal
range
despite
the
presence of distant metastases.
Serum CEA levels and positivities in
patients with nonmalignant thyroid dis-
eases are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I.
Only one of 9 patients with adenoma
showed
a CEA
level of 19 ng/ml, and
one of 7 patients with chronic thyroiditis
showed a marginally elevated value (12
ng/ml).
In all 14 patients with hyper-
thyroidism and 2 with thyroid cysts, the
levels remained within the normal range.

remained abnormally elevated in the cases
of incomplete resection.
After apparently
radical operation, the serum CEA level
returned to normal in one patient, but it
was
still
slightly
elevated
in
another
patient requiring a follow-up.
Tissue
concentrations
of CEA were
determined in 4 cases of MCT.
The values
ranged from 26 to 105 ,ug/g wet tissue,
averaging 64 ,ug/g, and represented 104-
420 times that of hyperthyroidism.
DISCUSSION
Although
positive
CEA
findings
initially appeared to be specific for malig-
nancies
of the
gastrointestinal
system
(Thomson et al., 1969), subsequent studies,
employing more sensitive techniques of
radioimmunoassay,
showed
that
serum
CEA increases in a variety of malignancies,
ranging from pulmonary to genito-urinary
systems and also in inflammatory bowel
diseases (Dykes and King, 1972; Laurence
et al., 1972a,b; Booth et al., 1973; Hansen
et al., 1974).
It is now accepted, however,
that the assay of serum CEA
is most
useful in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the
gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and bron-
chus, because positive CEA findings are
obtained in 70-900o of these diseases.
It
also appears valuable in the assessment of
neuroblastoma and possibly of testicular
and mammary neoplasms, since the CEA
levels were elevated in all 6 patients with
active
neuroblastoma
(Reynoso
et
al.,
1972) and in about half the patients with
the other
2 diseases (Dykes and King,
1972;
Laurence
and
Neville,
1972a).

However, its estimation is thought to be
of little value in the diagnosis of tumours
in other tissues.
Early
sporadic
studies
on
thyroid
diseases
showed
that
a
positive CEA
result was found in only one out of 9
patients with thyroid carcinoma but in
none
of
8
patients
with adenoma
or
nodular goitre
(Laurence
et
al.,
1972b;
Reynoso et al., 1972; Booth et al., 1973).
Quite
recently Rochman
et
al.
(1975)
reported
a more
frequent
elevation
of
CEA in their series including 37 patients
with thyroid carcinoma, but the positivity
was statistically significant only in cases
with no
previous
history
of childhood
irradiation.
In addition, no relationship
was noted between
levels of CEA and
spread or histological appearance of the
tumour.
However, the present study has re-
vealed
a
highly
specific
association
of
raised CEA levels with MCT.
The posi-
tivity obtained
is much higher than in
gastrointestinal malignancies and is com-
parable
with
that
in
neuroblastoma.
Furthermore,
the serum
levels were in
excess of 40 ng/ml in the majority (92%)
of patients including those with localized
disease.
The levels are even greater than
those in carcinomata ofthe gastrointestinal
tract,
bronchus
and
breast,
in
which
serum CEA above this level
is seen in
only
12-13%
of
early
and
localized
lesions and in 56-77% of distant meta-
stases (Laurence et al., 1 972b; Booth et al.,
1973).
It may be ascribed to the high
content of CEA in the tumour cells and
also
to abundant
blood supply to the
endocrine
organ.
The
results
indicate
that the assay of CEA is very useful in the
diagnosis and follow-up of MCT.
In other histological types of thyroid
carcinoma studied by us, serum CEA has
remained mostly within the normal range,
the findings being similar to those pre-
viously reported.
It is likely, therefore,
that the previous studies may include few
or no cases of MCT, the incidence of which
is 5-10% of thyroid carcinoma (Melvin
et al., 1972).
With few exceptions, h-igh CEA levels
were detected in MCT, which originates
from the parafollicular cell.
Interestingly
enough,
this
cell
is thought
to be of
neural crest origin and hence differs in its
embryological derivation from the other
parenchymal
cells of the thyroid gland
(Pearce, 1968; Weichert, 1970).
Further-
more, it was reported that neuroblastoma,
another neural
crest tumour, showed a
positive CEA finding in nearly all cases,
and that the mean value was 4-5 ng/ml in
the
active
disease
as compared
to the
normal
range
of
less
than
2 5 ng/ml
(Reynoso et al.,
1972).
The lower level
of CEA in the latter condition may well
be due to a less rich blood supply to the
tissue.
It is therefore suggested that the
highly specific association of raised CEA
in the 2 neoplasmas may be related to a
defect of neuroectodermal origin, although
further studies should be performed with
other neural crest tumours.
We
are indebted
to Dr
Phil
Gold,
Montreal General Hospital, Montreal, for
his generous supply of reference CEA and
his kind advice in preparing CEA and
anti-CEA antiserum, to Prof. Kanji Tori-
zuka for his continuous encouragement,
and to Dr Rikushi Morita for his kindness
in supplying patient material.

Summary
Twenty seven adult patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma localised to either
bone (Stage IE) or bone and regional lymph nodes (Stage IIE) were treated between 1967 and 1988. Median
age was 53 years and the commonest histology (21 patients) was diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Twenty-four
patients were treated radically:
15 with radiation therapy (XRT) alone and nine with chemotherapy plus
radiation therapy (CMT). The cause specific survival for these patients was 56% at 5 years and 40% at 10
years. Survival was significantly better for patients treated by CMT (88% at 5 years) as compared to XRT
alone (40% at 5 years, P = 0.03) and for age <60 (72% at 5 years) compared to > 60 (30% at 5 years,
P = 0.018). Relapse-free rate was 27% at 5 years with XRT alone and 89% with CMT (P = 0.01). Risk factors
for loco-regional relapse (seven cases) included: large tumour bulk, treatment by XRT alone and use of
'limited' radiation fields. No radiation dose-response relationship could be identified in this study. Long term
local control and survival for localised lymphoma of bone were excellent after treatment by CMT but XRT
alone was associated with unacceptably high local and distant failure rates.
In Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, involvement of bone at pres-
entation
is
relatively
uncommon
and
in
the
context
of
advanced disease it may be impossible to determine if the
lymphoma has arisen primarily within bone or has spread to
bone secondarily. Various definitions of 'primary' lymphoma
of bone have been used but in general the term refers to cases
in which bone involvement occurs as a local or locoregional
presentation of lymphoma, without evidence of disseminated
disease. This presentation accounts for approximately 5% of
all localised extranodal lymphomas (Freeman et al., 1972).
Because of its rarity, most reports of bone lymphoma in the
literature included either small numbers of patients (Menden-
hall et al., 1987; Bacci et al., 1986) or encompassed relatively
long time-scales (Ostrowski
et
al.,
1986; Dosoretz
et
al.,
1983). These reports incorporated all stages of disease and
multiple
therapeutic
strategies
including
surgery
alone,
surgery and post-operative XRT, XRT alone, CMT and
chemotherapy alone. Consequently,
it has been difficult to
determine
the important prognostic
factors and optimum
treatment for this condition.
We have previously reported on the patterns of disease and
prognostic factors in patients with localised extranodal lym-
phomas treated at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) from
1967-1978
(Gospodarowicz
et
al.,
1987).
This
report
included 14 localised lymphomas of bone out of a total of
226 patients. Our current report examines these 14 patients in
greater detail, as well as a further 13 patients treated between
1979 and 1988. Our objective has been to analyse the prog-
nostic factors, response to treatment and patterns of failure
in this group of patients in order to examine our current
approaches to patients with localised bone lymphoma.
Materials and methods
Patient population
The records of all adult patients registered at PMH with a
diagnosis
of malignant
lymphoma
involving
bone
from
1967-1988
were
reviewed. A
total
of 57
patients
were
identified of which 27 (14 males, 13 females) had localised
disease (stage I and II) and are the subjects of this report.
The median age was 53 years and patients' age ranged from
20 to 88 years. All patients had biopsy-proven NHL arising
in bone. Pathology in all cases was reviewed at PMH at the
time of treatment and classified according to Rappaport
(Rappaport,
1966). The main patients and disease charac-
teristics are summarised in Table I. Pain was the commonest
presenting complaint and the mean duration of symptoms
prior to diagnosis was 14 months. The most frequent site of
presentation was the femur (Figure
1).
Six patients had
pathological
fractures
at
presentation.
All
patients
had
abnormal X-rays with a lytic pattern of bone involvement in
20 cases, sclerotic in two cases and mixed in five cases. Based
on the Ann Arbor classification for Hodgkin's disease (Car-
bone et al., 1971), patients were staged as clinical stage IE if
disease was confined to a single bone, and stage IIE
if
confined to a single bone plus regional lymph nodes. No
patient in this series had
'B' symptoms. Measurement of

tumour bulk was based on the maximum dimension of the
tumour as determined from clinical and imaging information,
and was categorised as either 10cm or less, or greater than
10cm. Staging investigations performed after diagnosis varied
over the time-course of the study but all patients had a chest
x-ray, 70% had lymphangiography or abdomino-pelvic CT
scan, 70% had a bone marrow biopsy and 70% had a
skeletal survey or isotope bone scan.
Treatment
Three patients (all with Stage I diffuse histiocytic lymphoma)
were treated palliatively due to advanced age and serious
concomitant illness. All radically treated patients received
XRT and nine patients received additional chemotherapy
(pre-XRT in three cases, post-XRT in six cases). The radia-
tion dose for those treated with XRT alone ranged between
30-45Gy
(median
4OGy).
Patients
treated
with CMT
received 34-4OGy (median 35Gy), apart from one patient
where the dose was restricted to 25Gy after nine courses of
chemotherapy. The volume irradiated included the whole of
the affected bone in 14 patients. In ten patients, XRT was
restricted to the region of gross disease with a margin of
normal tissue ('limited' XRT). The regional lymph nodes
were treated systematically only in patients with stage
II
disease. Chemotherapy schedules varied over the time-course
of this report. The
first two patients received CVP (cyc-
lophosphamide,
vincristine and prednisone),
the following
four
patients
received
C-MOPP
or
COPP
(cyclophos-
phamide, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone) and the
three most
recently
treated
patients
received CHOP
or
BACOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin,
vincristine, pred-
nisone +/- bleomycin). Patients received two to 20 courses
of chemotherapy with a median number of courses being
six.
Because of the difficulties in establishing the exact remis-
sion status of bony lesions, no attempt was made to distin-
guish between those patients who failed to achieve an initial
complete
response
(CR)
and
those who
relapsed
loco-
regionally
after
initial CR:
all were categorised
as loco-
regional relapse. Distant relapse was defined only in those
patients with loco-regional control.
Treatment of relapse was not standardised and in view of
the advanced age of many patients was often palliative. One
patient (with loco-regional relapse) was successfully salvaged
with chemotherapy and remains alive and free of disease 20
years later. No patient with distant relapse was successfully
salvaged.
Statistical methods
Survival and relapse-free rates were calculated using the Kap-
lan Meier method (Kaplan et al., 1958) and compared using
the Wilcoxon-Gehan method (Gehan, 1965). The log rank
method was used for multivariate analysis. Cause-specific
survival calculations were adjusted for deaths due to condi-
tions clearly unrelated to the disease process.
Results
The 5 year actuarial survival was 56%, cause-specific survival
56% and relapse-free rate 48%. Ten year results were 37%,
40% and 39% respectively (Figure 2). analysis of possible
prognostic factors including treatment, age, bulk and his-
tology was performed and a significant survival advantage
was shown for those treated by CMT (P = 0.03) and for age
less than 60 years (P = 0.018, Table II). There was a trend
towards inferior survival for patients with bulky disease but
statistical
significance
was
not
reached.
There
were
insufficient numbers of patients with subtypes other than
diffuse histiocytic to assess the effect of histology on prog-
nosis. Multivariate analysis using log rank method adjusting
for the above variables showed a significant survival advan-
tage only for age less than 60 years (P = 0.042).
With respect to the risk of relapse, a significant advantage
was shown for patients treated with CMT (P = 0.01), for age
less than 60 years (P = 0.017) and for bulk 10cm or less
(P = 0.0 17). With multivariate analysis the impact of bulk
and treatment modality was maintained but age was not
significant. Relapse-free rates according to disease bulk and
treatment modality are shown in Figure 3.
To determine whether the influence of treatment and
tumour bulk on relapse was predominantly via the effect on
loco-regional or on distant relapse, patients were analysed
according to treatment modality and according to whether
the loco-regional
failure was within
the XRT
treatment
volume or marginal. They were further subdivided according
to
the
extent of the
treatment volume (whole bone
or
'limited'). Four patients relapsed in-field, three treated by
XRT alone and one by CMT. The mean XRT dose (36.5Gy)
for these patients was similar to the mean dose (36.9Gy) for
the whole group and thus no dose-response relationship was
identified in this study. Three of the in-field recurrences (two
treated with XRT alone and one with CMT) were in-patients
with bulk greater than 10cm giving a 50% local recurrence
rate in the radically treated group with bulk greater than
10cm. A further three patients had marginal recurrences. All
three had been treated with a 'limited' XRT volume. Only

recurred loco-regionally but, because of the small numbers,
no statistical difference was observed in loco-regional control
for those treated with CMT and XRT (Table II).
Seven patients with loco-regional control relapsed at dis-
tant sites. The site of first relapse was nodal in five of these
and extranodal in two. Only one patient relapsed in bone and
none relapsed in CNS. Six of the seven patients had XRT
alone as initial therapy and only one received CMT. Even
with the small number of patients, the distant relapse rate for
CMT was significantly lower than that for XRT alone (Table
II).

years after treatment. To date there have been no second

or

Discussion
The first description of malignant lymphoma of bone was
made by Oberling in 1928 (Oberling, 1928) and the first series
was reported by Parker and Jackson in 1939( Parker et al.,
1939).
This
latter
paper
described
the
histological
appearances and clinical course of 17 cases of reticulum cell
sarcoma of bone, highlighting features which distinguished
this
condition
from
other
round
cell
tumours
of bone,
especially Ewing's sarcoma. In their series there was a slight
excess of males, the femur was the commonest site of origin,
radiology revealed a mainly lytic pattern of bone destruction
and there was a relatively favourable prognosis after radical
local treatment (42% survived for 10 years after surgery).
Most cases of reticulum-cell sarcoma would now be classified
as either diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (Rappaport, 1966) or
diffuse large-cell lymphoma (NCI working formulation, 1982)
and many reports have now confirmed this to be by far the
commonest form of NHL to affect bone. In contrast to NHL
elsewhere,
follicular
and
diffuse
well
differentiated
lym-
phocytic types rarely present in bone (Clayton et al., 1987;
Mendenhall et al., 1987). The clinical features reported by
Parker and Jackson and the potential for cure in up to 50%
of patients with local therapy have also been reproduced in
subsequent
studies
(Dosoretz
et
al.,
1983;
Shoji
et
al.,
1971).
In our own series, 5 and 10 year cause-specific survival for
radically treated localised lymphoma of bone was 56% and
40%
respectively.
These
overall
figures
are
similar
to
previous reports but when primary treatment consisted of
XRT alone the 5 year cause-specific survival was 40%
as
compared to 88% for patients treated with CMT (P = 0.03).
We observed a survival advantage for patients aged less than
60 years and there was a tendency for more of these younger
patients to receive chemotherapy. However, the extent of the
survival advantage for CMT was so great, that age selection
is unlikely to account for all of the effect. Indeed, when
relapse-free rates were compared by multivariate analysis, the
significant
effect
of
treatment
modality
was
maintained
whereas that of age was not. A survival benefit for CMT
over XRT alone has been reported in other studies (Menden-
hall et al., 1987; Bacci et al., 1986), though not everyone has
found such an advantage in adult patients (Ostrowski et al.,
1986).
In children the advantage appears to be irrefutable
(Furman et al., 1989; Loeffler et al., 1986). In our study, the
number of patients with histologies other than diffuse his-
tiocytic was small and thus, no apparent influence of his-
tological subtype on survival was seen - a finding consistent
with
other
reports (Ostrowski
et
al.,
1986).
Unlike some
previous reports (Ostrowski et al., 1986; Shoji et al., 1971) we
found no evidence of inferior survival where vertebral
or
pelvic bones were involved.
In this report we have looked in some detail at the loco-
regional
failures. Previous reports suggested that the loco-
regional relapse rate after XRT alone varies from 14% to
43% (Dosoretz et al., 1983; Shoji et al., 1971). Generally the
rate appears to be higher than the 25% usually reported for
localised diffuse histiocytic lymphomas at other sites (Bush et
al., 1977; Fuks et al., 1973). In our own series 20% of those
treated by XRT alone relapsed within the treatment volume
and a further 20% had marginal loco-regional relapses. Our
results suggest that large disease bulk (present in two out of
three relapses)
is an important risk factor for local failure
after XRT alone, a finding in common with our previous
reports of radiation for localised NHL (Gospodarowicz
et
al.,
1987; Sutcliffe et al.,
1985). Doses of XRT reported in
other series have generally been higher with some claims for
a dose response relationship (Dosoretz et al., 1983; Wang et
al., 1968). Our data did not show evidence for such a rela-
tionship and indeed the three patients with in-field failure
after XRT alone all received doses higher than the median of
35Gy. Where XRT alone was employed the importance of
using a large
initial
radiation volume (with
or without a
boost to the main site of disease) to avoid marginal failures
has been
clearly shown. Our data
further suggested
that
loco-regional control was superior for CMT as compared to
XRT alone. Only one out of nine patients treated with CMT
relapsed loco-regionally, compared to six out of 15 treated
with XRT alone, giving a
5 year local relapse-free rate of
89% with CMT compared to 64%
at 5 years (48%
at
10
606
A.J. RATHMELL et al.
years) for XRT alone. Three other recently reported series
have also shown excellent local control in adults treated with
CMT (Susnorwala et al., 1990; Mendenhall et al., 1987; Bacci
et al., 1986). For children, chemotherapy appears to be so
effective that some authors have suggested omitting XRT
completely (Loeffer et al., 1986), though the consequences of
local failure are so great that, to date, this has not become a
widely accepted approach.
Previous publications have not always stated the frequency
of distant relapse in patients achieving loco-regional control,
but where reported, the rate after local therapy alone ranges
from 22-38% (Mendenhall et al., 1987; Wang et al., 1968).
In our own series 58% of the XRT alone group experienced
distant relapse (with loco-regional control) within 5 years of
treatment. In contrast only one of nine patients treated with
CMT
developed
distant
relapse
and
despite
the
small
numbers this recurrence rate was significantly lower than for
XRT alone (P = 0.03). This finding is consistent with several
other recent reports (Susnorwala et al., 1990; Bacci et al.,
1986).
Imaging of the primary tumour in
this study was by
conventional
X-rays
and
isotope
bone
scanning.
These
modalities tend to underestimate the extent of tumour spread
both along the medullary cavity and in the surrounding soft
tissues when compared to more modern techniques (Salter et
al., 1989). This may account for at least some of the marginal
recurrences seen after the use of 'limited' radiation treatment
volumes and we now believe that all patients should have CT
and
preferably
also magnetic
resonance
imaging
of the
primary site as part of the initial disease assessment.
In summary, our study suggested that patients treated with
localised lymphoma of the bone treated with XRT alone
have a higher risk of loco-regional relapse than those with
comparable nodal and extranodal lymphomas at other sites,
especially when bulky disease is present. As for (diffuse his-
tiocytic) lymphomas at other sites, we found no evidence of a
significant gain in local control with the use of radiation
doses
greater
than 35-4OGy
(Sutcliffe
et
al.,
1985). A
significant improvement in cause-specific and relapse-free sur-
vival with the use of CMT as compared to XRT alone has
been demonstrated and we feel that this approach should
now be standard therapy. The optimum schedule, timing and
duration of chemotherapy cannot be determined from our
data but other recent reports of treatment for localised lym-
phoma suggest that for small bulk disease three or four
courses of doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy
prior to XRT is adequate (Connors et al., 1987; Longo et al.,
1989).
For bulky
disease, more prolonged chemotherapy
prior to XRT is probably desirable.
The late complication rate in this series was very low with
no cases of osteoradionecrosis or pathological fracture. This
provides further support for the use of moderate radiation
doses, as complication rates, even in adults, appear to be
significantly higher at doses of 45-50Gy or more (Menden-
hall, 1987; Dosoretz, 1983; Stokes, 1983).

Abstract. We have recently described a novel cDNA,
SR13 (Welcher, A . A., U . Suter, M . De Leon, G . J.
Snipes, and E . M . Shooter. 1991 . Proc. Natl . Acad.
Sci . USA . 88 .7195-7199), that is repressed after sciatic
nerve crush injury and shows homology to both the
growth arrest-specific mRNA, gas3 (Manfioletti, G.,
M . E . Ruaro, G . Del Sal, L . Philipson, and
C . Schneider. 1990. Mol. Cell Biol. 10:2924-2930),
and to the myelin protein, PASII (Kitamura, K., M .
Suzuki, and K . Uyemura . 1976. Biochim. Biophys.
Acta . 455 :806-816) . In this report, we show that the
22-kD SR13 protein is expressed in the compact portion
of essentially all myelinated fibers in the peripheral
nervous system . Although SR13 mRNA was found in
the central nervous system, no corresponding SR13
YELIN is a highly specialized extension of the plasma
membrane of Schwann cells in the peripheral ner-
M vous system (PNS)' and of oligodendrocytes in
the central nervous system (CNS) . Its characteristic mul-
tilaminated structure is produced by the wrapping of the
plasma membrane of myelin-forming cells around axons,
forming a cylindrical sheath which is divided longitudinally
into discontinuous segments, interrupted by the nodes of
Ranvier (for a detailed description see Peters et al ., 1976) .
When viewed in cross section, myelin is composed of alter-
nating apposing cytoplasmic and extracellular surfaces of
the plasma membrane which give rise to the major dense
line and the intraperiod line, respectively (Napolitano and
Scallen, 1969) . This highly ordered membranous sheath
facilitates the electrical conduction velocity of myelinated
axons (Ritchie, 1984) .
Peripheral and central nervous system myelin have been
extensively studied and, although their general organization
is quite similar, they differ with regards to morphological ap-

protein could be detected by either immunoblot analysis
or by immunohistochemistry. Northern and immunoblot
analysis of SRI 3 mRNA and protein expression during
development of the peripheral nervous system reveal a
pattern similar to other myelin proteins . Furthermore,
we demonstrate by in situ mRNA hybridization on tis-
sue sections and on individual nerve fibers that SR13
mRNA is produced predominantly by Schwann cells .
We conclude that the SR13 protein is apparently exclu-
sively expressed in the peripheral nervous system
where it is a major component of myelin . Thus, we
propose the name Peripheral Myelin Protein-22 (PMP-
22) for the proteins and cDNAs previously designated
PASII, SR13, and gas3.
pearance and protein composition (Morell et al., 1989) . In
the CNS, each oligodendrocyte produces up to 30 internodal
myelin segments which tend to have fewer lamellae than
PNS myelin . As opposed to the oligodendrocyte, a single
Schwann cell can produce only one internodal myelin seg-
ment around a single axon in the PNS . Additional morpho-
logical differences between central and peripheral myelin
have been described (Peters et al., 1976) .
The major structural myelin proteins in the CNS include
proteolipid protein (PLP), the myelin basic proteins (MBP),
and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (for review see
Campagnoni, 1988) . PLP is a highly hydrophobic trans-
membrane protein which projects into both the major dense
line, and the intraperiod line, and has been implicated in
maintaining the apposition between the extracellular faces
(the intraperiod line) of myelin (Hudson et al ., 1987) . In
contrast, MBP is a highly charged soluble intracellular pro-
tein whose expression is limited to the major dense line .
MAG is a glycoprotein that is structurally related to the im-
munoglobulin gene superfamily (Salzer et al., 1987) . This
protein has been hypothesized to play a role in myelin-axon
interactions because of its homology to molecules involved
in cellular recognition and adhesion and its immunolocaliza-
tion to the axoplasmic surface of myelin, although this local-
ization is controversial (Trapp and Quarles, 1984) . Recent
experiments examining recombinant retrovirus-mediated
225
MAG overexpression in mixed Schwann cell neuron cultures
also provide support for the hypothesis that MAG is involved
in axon-Schwann cell interactions (Owens et al., 1990) .
Protein zero (PO), MBP, and MAG are the major protein
components of PNS myelin (reviewed in Morell et al ., 1989 ;
Lemke, 1988) . P0, a transmembrane glycoprotein which,
like MAG, belongs to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily
(Lai et al., 1987 ; Lemke et al ., 1988) is the most abundant
protein in PNS myelin . The immunoglobulin-like extracellu-
lar domain of PO is located in the intraperiod line and has
ledto the hypothesis that PO may be responsible for the adhe-
sion between the extracellular surfaces of the myelin plasma
membrane. Recent studies on cultured cells clearly demon-
strate the capacity of PO to undergo homophilic interactions
(Filbin et al.,
1990 ; Schneider-Schaulies
et al .,
1990 ;
D'Urso et al., 1990) .
The regulation of myelin protein expression is under ex-
quisite control because of the highly specialized function of
myelin in the nervous system . In development and after in-
jury to the PNS, cessation of Schwann cell proliferation is
followed by myelin formation (Asbury, 1967) . The synthesis
of the major myelin proteins correlates closely with the for-
mation of myelin during the development of both the CNS
and PNS (Uyemura et al ., 1979 ; Lamperth et al ., 1990 ;
Kronquist et al., 1987 ; Stahl et al ., 1990) . After peripheral
nerve injury, myelin protein expression is quickly dimin-
ished, presumably because of transcriptional regulation ini-
tiated by loss of axonal contact . Myelin protein synthesis re-
sumes
in crush-lesioned peripheral nerves with a time
course comparable to the remyelination of regenerating
axons (Trapp et al., 1988 ; LeBlanc and Poduslo, 1990 ;
Mitchell et al., 1990) . Thus, myelin protein expression
shows a similar pattern of regulation both during develop-
ment and during nerve regeneration .
Recently, we described the cloning and initial character-
ization of a putative myelin protein, designated SRI3, which
was isolated by differential screening of cDNA libraries from
injured versus uninjured rat sciatic nerves (Welcher et al.,
1991b) . The SR13 cDNA sequence predicts a 160-amino
acid protein of 18 kD. Nucleotide sequence comparisons
revealed an extensive homology of SR13 with the growth-
arrest specific gene gas3 (Manfioletti et al., 1990) and con-
siderable amino acid identity with the partial amino acid se-
quence of PAS-II, a protein previously isolated from bovine
peripheral myelin (Kitamura et al., 1976) . Based on these
findings and preliminary immunohistochemical studies, we
suggested that SR13 is a myelin protein (Welcher et al .,
1991b) . Furthermore, since gas3 has been proposed as a
regulator ofcell growth in tissue culture fibroblasts, we have
been interested in examining the possibility of a similar
regulatory function for SR13 in vivo . Because ofthe associa-
tion of SR13/gas3 with growth arrest, it was also of interest
to examine the expression of SRI3 during periods of cell di-
vision in development and after nerve injury.
We have characterized the time course of SRI3 expression
and its anatomical localization during myelination as well as
after nerve injury. In these studies, we have demonstrated
that SR13 is a 22-kD myelin protein which is expressed ex-
clusively in the PNS . Thus, we propose the name Peripheral
Myelin Protein 22 (PMP-22) for this protein that was previ-
ously designated SRI3, gas3, and PAS-II .

Materials and Methods
Animal Care and Surgery
All surgical procedures followed the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals at Stanford University.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6-wk old ; Bantin and Kingman, Inc., Fremont,
CA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection ofa mixture ofketamine
and chloral hydrate. The right sciatic nerves were exposed and crushed for
30 s with No. 5 jeweler's forceps -2-mmdistal to the hip joint . In a similar
fashion, the contralateral nerve was exposed but not crushed . At timed in-
tervals, the crush-lesioned animals and developing rat pups were euthanized
in a C0 2 atmosphere. Sciatic nerves, brains, and spinal cords were quickly
removed and snap frozenon dry iceor placed immediately into 4% parafor-
maldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for paraffin embedding or
in isotonic glutaraldehyde
buffer
(0.33 M sodium
cacodylate,
2 .7
glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4) followed by postfixation in aqueous 2% osmium
tetroxide before embedding in LX112 resin
. Selected tissue blocks were
processed for EM .
Preparation ofAnti-PMP 22Antibodies
Two peptides were selected using hydrophilicity and surface probability
predictions based on the primary amino acid sequence of PMP-22/SR13 .

(A carboxy-terminal cysteine wasadded for cross-linking purposes) . Amino
acid numbering refersto the primary amino acid sequence of PMP-22/SR13
(Welcher et al ., 1991b) . Both peptides were synthesized on an automated
peptide synthesizer (Milligen/Biosearch, Burlington, MA) and cross-linked
to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., San Diego,
CA) as follows : 250 pl keyhole limpet hemocyanin (20 mg/ml in 50 mM
sodium phosphate, pH 6) was mixed with 25 lal m-maleimidobenzoyl-
N-hydroxysuccinimide
ester (Calbiochem-Behring Corp . ; 100 mg/ml in
tetrahydrofuran) . 250 pl 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6, was added and
the mixture was incubated for30 min at roomtemperature with gentle agita-
tion . 1-ml peptide solution (5 mg/ml in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6)
was added and the mixture was incubated with rocking for another 3 h at
room temperature . The cross-linked proteins were then dialyzed against
PBS for 48 h at 4°C with several buffer changes . Insoluble material was re-
moved by centrifugation and the volume adjusted to 2 ml with PBS. 250
pl ofthe conjugate was combined with 350 pl free peptide solution (3 mg/ml
in PBS) and 600 pd Freund's complete adjuvants (Sigma Chemical Co., St .
Louis, MO) was added . This cocktail was used for primary immunization
of female New Zealand rabbits. The rabbits were boosted 14, 38, and 58 d
after the initial immunization with the same solution except that Freund's
incomplete adjuvant was used . Both peptides gave rise to comparable an-
tisera in two different rabbits as judged from solid-phase ELISA .
Isolation ofProteins and ImmunoblotAnalysis
20 to 150 mg offrozen tissue was added to 1 ml of a PBS-1% SDS solution .
The tissue was disrupted using a polytron (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc.,
Westbury, NY) at the highest setting for 10 s, after which the sample was
placed in a 100°C water bath, and boiled for 3 min . Insoluble material was
pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature in
a low speed centrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Inc ., Fullerton, CA) . The
supernatant was removed to a microfuge tube and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm
for 10 min at room temperature . Dilutions of the supernatants were used
to determine the protein concentration by the BCA protein assay system
(Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) using the manufacturer's reagents and
instructions.
Equivalent amounts of the protein samples were added to sample buffer
containing 0.5%
2-mercaptoethanol,
electrophoresed
through
12 .5
SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described
previously (Welcher et al ., 1991x) . The filters were blocked with a solution
of PBS-0.05% Tween-5% nonfat milk (Blotto), incubated with antiserum
to peptide 1 diluted 1:1,000 in Blotto, followed by incubation with affinity

tions were at room temperature for 1 h each . The filters were autoradi-
ographed, and films scanned as described for the Northern blots .
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for the PMP-22 protein on 4% paraformaldehyde-
fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was performed as previously described
(Welcher et al ., 199lb) except that both primary antipeptide antibodies were
used simultaneously at a dilution of 1:100 and the blocking and primary an-
tiserum solutions contained 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Chemical Co .) . Rab-
bit anti-human MBP serum (DAKOPATTS, Copenhagen) was used at a di-
lution of 1:60. For high resolution light microscopic and immunoperoxidase
studies, nerves were embedded in LX 112 (Ladd Research Industries, Inc.,
Burlington, VT) and 0.5-i4m-thick sections were cut on an ultramicrotome
(Reichert Jung, Vienna) and either stained with 1 % toluidine blue oretched
with sodium hydroxide-saturated ethanol for 20 s as described by Baskin
et al . (1979) and processed for immunohistochemistry as described above .
RNA Isolation andNorthern Blots
Total RNA was extracted from at least six pooled sciatic nerves according
to the method ofChomczynski and Sacchi (1987) and analyzed by Northern
blotting using Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Corp.) . Total RNA was
quantitated initially by optical density measurements at260 run and verified
by ethidium bromide staining . Blots were probed with a 32p-labeled PMP-
22/SR13 cDNA probe (hexanucleotide labeling kit ; Boehringer Mannheim
Corp., Indianapolis, IN), washed under high stringency conditions, and ex-
posed to XAR5 films (Eastern Kodak Co ., Rochester, NY) . Quantitative
analysis was performed by densitometric scanning of appropriate (linear

In Situ mRNA Hybridization
The 1.6-kb Xbal fragment of the PMP-22/SR13 cDNA was subcloned in
both orientations into the Xbal site of the pSP72 (Promega Biotec, Madi-
son, WI) plasmid . Sense and antisense riboprobes, containing 35 S CTP
(Amersham Corp .), were synthesized according to the manufacturer's in-
structions. Paraffin sections cut onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated
glass slides (Rentrap et al .,
1986) were deparaffinized
in xylenes, re-
hydrated through graded ethanol solutions, and treated sequentially with
4% paraformaldehyde (5 min), 20 mM HCl (3 min), 0.01% Triton X-100
(3 min), 1 ug/mI proteinase K (10 min ; 50 mM Tris, 3 mM EDTA, pH 8 .0),
and 4% paraformaldehyde (5 min) each separated by two washes in PBS
(3 min each ; supplemented with 0 .2 % glycine after theproteinase K incuba-
tion) . The sections were then dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions
and air dried . For nerve tease experiments, normal sciatic nerves were fixed
in buffered formalin, teased onto silane-treated slides, and dried in a 37°C
oven for 3 h . The teased nerves were treated as described above, starting
with the 4% paraformaldehyde solution . Sections were prehybridized with
25 mM Tris, 0.75 M NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, IX Denhardt's solution, 50%
formamide, 0.2% SDS, 225 kg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 225 lag/ml
poly A, 15 mM DTT at 42°C for 3 h and hybridized for 16 h at 53°C in
prehybridization solution containing 106 cpm sense or antisense probes
and 5 % dextran sulfate . Hybridization signals were detected with 0-max
high resolution film (Amersham Corp .) or withphotographic emulsion. For
double label experiments, the sections were first hybridized with the PMP-
22 sense and antisense probes then inununolabeled with rabbit anti-bovine
S-100 (1:100, Dako Corp ., Santa Barbara, CA) using the hybridization and
peroxidase antiperoxidase techniques described above .
Results
PMR22, a 22-kD Protein, Is a Componentofall
Myelin Sheaths in the Peripheral Nervous System
Synthetic peptides corresponding to the two predicted major
hydrophilic regions of the PMP-22 molecule were con-
jugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize
rabbits . The antisera to both peptides were found
to be
specific for a 22-kD protein on electrophoretic transfers (im-
munoblots) of total protein isolated from rat sciatic nerves .

ded in LX 112 . For immunohistochemistry, 0.5 um sections were etched with ethanolic sodium hydroxide for 20 s before immunoperoxidase

(Fig. 1, lane 2) which is abolished by preincubating the an-
tiserum with PMP-22 peptide 1 (Fig . 1, lane 1) . The PMP-22
protein is predicted to have a molecular mass of 18,000 based
on the peptide sequence and contains a consensus sequence
for N-linked glycosylation (Welcher et al., 1991b) which
predicts a total molecular mass consistent with a 21-22-kD
protein . Both antipeptide antisera had identical specificities
on immunoblots and in immunohistochemical studies . Con-
trol blots using preimmune serum were consistently negative
(data not shown) .
While PMP-22 is expressed at high levels in normal adult
rat sciatic nerves, Northern blot analysis showed that PMP-
22 mRNA expression was undetectable in liver and kidney
but was present in trace levels in heart and skeletal mus-
cle (Welcher et al., 1991b) . Immunoblot and immunohisto-
chemical analysis of the PMP-22 protein agreed with the
previous results and identified no detectable PMP-22 protein
expression in a variety of tissues including heart, gut, lung,
adrenal gland, kidneys, skeletal muscle, thymus, and spleen
except in the myelin of the innervating nerves (data not
shown) . Initial immunohistochemical results had demon-
strated that PMP-22 was associated with the myelin sheaths
of axons in the sciatic nerve (Welcher et al ., 1991b) . This
finding was confirmed by immunoperoxidase studies on
0.5-,urn plastic sections which localized the PMP-22 protein
to the compact portion of the myelin sheaths of essentially
all myelinated axons in the sciatic nerve (Fig . 2 a) when com-
pared to toluidine blue-stained adjacentplastic sections (Fig .
2 c) . It was concluded that PMP-22 protein expression is ap-

PMR22 Expression Correlates with Myelin Formation
during Sciatic Nerve Development
After having identified PMP-22 as a putative myelin protein,
it was important to compare its expression with other myelin
proteins to establish the role of PMP-22 in myelin formation
and to investigate its role in cellular growth arrest . Thus, a
time course study of PMP-22 expression was undertaken
during the immediate postnatal period to adulthood, the time
interval in which Schwann cell proliferation ceases and my-
elination ensues in the rat sciatic nerve (Friede and Samoraj-
ski, 1968) . Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated
from sciatic nerves at different time points in development
showed that a single 1.8-kb PMP-22 mRNA species is ini-
tially expressed at low levels in the immediate postnatal
period (10 % ofmaximal) but is rapidly induced to adult lev-
els over the first three postnatal weeks (Fig . 3 A) . Densito-
metric analysis of the RNA blots demonstrated that PMP-22
mRNA expression reached half-maximal adult levels be-
tween postnatal days two to seven and increased to near max-
imal levels by postnatal day 21 (Fig. 3 C) .
Parallel immunoblot analysis of PMP-22 protein expres-
sion in the developing rat sciatic nerve revealed that, as ex-
pected, the production of PMP-22 protein lags temporally
behind PMP-22 mRNA expression (Fig . 3 B) . Overall, how-
ever, protein and mRNA display parallel expression pat-

in the immediate postnatal period but reach half-maximal
values between postnatal days 10 and 15 and maximal levels

sis showed that PMP-22 protein expression is restricted to
myelin and correlates temporally with the formation of my-
elin when compared to the expression of MBP, another
component of compact myelin, and to myelin formation as
monitored using toluidine blue-stained plastic sections of
developing rat sciatic nerves (Fig . 4) .
Expression ofPMR22 Is Dramatically Lower in
the Central Nervous System than in the Peripheral
Nervous System
Previous studies indicated that PMP22 mRNA is present in
low levels in the brain, (Welcher et al ., 1991b) . Thus, it was
of interest to determine ifPMP22 was also a component of
myelin in the CNS . Initial attempts to visualize PMP-22 pro-
tein in the brain using immunohistochemical methods were
unsuccessful, a finding which was subsequently explained by
Northern and immunoblot analysis . Quantitation of North-
ern blots of total RNA isolated from the brain revealed that
the mRNA for PMP22 is -300-fold less abundant in brain
than in sciatic nerve (Fig . 5 A, lanes B versus SN) . Fur-
thermore, in contrast to PMP-22 mRNAexpression in periph-
eral nerve, the brain PMP22 mRNA levels are not develop-
mentally regulated (Fig. 5 A, lanes E19-200) . No PMP22
protein was detectable in 100 hg of brain tissue at any time

tect PMP-22 protein from 1 p,g of nerve tissue (Fig . 5 B) .
It is concluded that PMP-22 protein levels in the brain are

at least 100-fold lower than in peripheral nerve . As a second
CNS tissue, spinal cord preparations (SCP) were examined
for PMP-22 expression . Initial quantitative Northern blot
analysis of SCP-derived RNA revealed appreciable levels of
PMP-22 mRNA expression (Fig . 5 A, lane SCP) . Similarly,
relatively high levels of PMP-22 protein were detected in
SCP by immunoblot analysis (Fig . 5 B) . In situ mRNA hy-
bridization (Fig . 6 a) and immunohistochemistry (Fig . 6 c),
however, clearly demonstrated the expression of PMP-22
protein and mRNA in the PNS-derived dorsal and ventral
spinal roots but failed to provide evidence of significant
PMP22 expression in the spinal cord . These results suggest
that some, if not most, of PMP-22 mRNA and protein de-
tected in the SCP is because of PMP-22 expression in the spi-
nal roots of peripheral nerves . It remains possible that the
absolute levels of PMP-22 mRNA and protein in the spinal
cord differs from the low levels observed in the brain since
a direct comparison between these structures cannot be
made from these results . We conclude that, while PMP-22
mRNA may be expressed in the CNS at very low levels in
a nondevelopmentally regulated manner, PMP22 protein
and mRNA levels are expressed at much higher levels in the
PNS . Although we cannot exclude regional expression of
PMP22 in the brain, the protein is not a major component
of CNS myelin .
PMR22 Expression Correlates with Myelin
Degradation and Remyelination during Sciatic

PMP-22 was originally identified based on its precipitous
down regulation after sciatic nerve crush injury. We have

now characterized in more detail the expression of PMP-22
after sciatic nerve crush to compare it to similar studies
which have been performed using other known myelin pro-
teins . Sciatic nerves were crushed several millimeters distal
to the hip joint and marked with a loosely tied silk suture .
At predetermined times after crush injury, 1-2-cm segments
of sciatic nerve distal to the site of crush injury along with
sham-operated contralateral nerves were harvested . Special
care was taken to avoid the immediate area around the site
of injury to eliminate the effects of local inflammation .
Northern blot analysis confirmed the previously described
rapid decline of PMP-22 mRNA to <10% of normal adult
levels by 3-7 d after crush injury. This decline in the levels
of PMP-22 mRNA is paralleled by a slower decline of the
22-kD PMP-22 protein expression which reaches similar
low levels during days 10 to 20 after crush injury. Although
PMP-22 mRNA and protein have started to approach normal
levels by 40 d after crush (Fig . 7), the expression of protein
lagged behind .
Morphological Studies on PMP-22 after Sciatic
Nerve Injury
Although the morphologic events after peripheral nerve in-
jury have been well described (for a historical perspective
see Weller and Cervos-Navarro, 1977), we have performed
anatomic studies in parallel with the protein and mRNA de-
tection experiments . This strategy allowed us to more pre-
cisely correlate the morphological changes with the pattern
of expression of the PMP-22 protein in the particular nerve
segments used for biochemical and molecular analysis . Fig.
8 shows the results of the immunohistochemical study of
PMP-22 and MBP expression after nerve injury. On the first
day after crush injury, the only pathological alteration in the
nerve segment distal to the site of crush injury is a slight
loosening of the myelin sheath . At this time, PMP-22 im-
munoreactivity is more evident in the myelin sheaths distal
to the site of crush injury than in the proximal nerve seg-
ment . This is probably because of loss of myelin integrity
and consequent increased antibody penetration since a simi-
lar increase in immunoreactivity was noted in nerve fibers
undergoing spontaneous Wallerian degeneration in aged rats.
Three days after crush injury, neurofilament immunoreac-
tivity is greatly diminished (data not shown) as the axons de-
generate . At this time point, the PMP-22 mRNA level has
fallen to 10% ofprecrush levels as the myelin sheaths are dis-
rupted and are being digested by the Schwann cells as re-

flected in the persistently elevated levels of immunostain-
ing for PMP-22 and MBP By 7 d after crush injury, PMP22
and MBP are found increasingly in ""digestion chambers of
Cajal "" a structure composed of Schwann cell cytoplasm sur-
rounding degenerating myelin ovoids . In situ mRNA hybrid-
ization for PMP-22 mRNA at 14 d after crush injury illus-
trates the downregulation of PMP-22 mRNA in the portion
of the sciatic nerve distal to the injury site when compared
to the proximal portion (Fig . 9) . Wallerian degeneration con-
tinues through the first 2 wk after injury as the absolute
PMP-22 protein levels and PMP-22 immunoreactivity de-
cline . In our system, axonal regeneration is evident 21 d after
crush injury as shown by the presence of thinly myelinated
axons in toluidine blue-stained plastic sections and electron
micrographs (not shown) . As demonstrated on immuno-
blots, PMP-22 protein levels start to increase by 21 d after
crush injury. Axon regeneration continues through at least
40 d after crush injury as demonstrated by the Bielschowski
silver stain for axons (data not shown) . By 40 d after crush,
the PMP-22 immunoreactivity is present predominantly in
the many newly formed myelin sheaths and occasionally in
residual ""digestion chambers of Cajal."" This finding corre-
lates well with the Northern and immunoblot results which
demonstrate increased levels of PMP-22 protein and mRNA
40 d after crush injury.
PMR22 Is Produced by Schwann Cells
Our initial characterization ofPMP-22 provided no evidence
for significant expression of the PMP-22 protein outside of
the PNS . In addition, there is compelling evidence that PMP-
22 is a myelin protein and, therefore, must be synthesized by
Schwann cells . Yet, after clarification of a sequencing error
in the mouse gas3 cDNA, it is clear that PMP-22 and gas3
share 98 % amino acid identity over the complete protein se-
quence (data not shown) . Thus, PMP-22 is the rat homo-
logue to the mouse gas3 cDNA which was isolated from
growth-arrested fibroblasts (Schneider et al., 1988 ; Manfio-
letti et al., 1990) . Since fibroblasts are also a component of
the nerve sheath, it seemed possible that endoneurial fibro-
blasts could be the major source of PMP-22 expression . Two
experiments were carried out to identify the cells that are
mainly responsible for PMP-22 expression . First, we per-
formed in situ mRNA hybridization for PMP-22 on teased
nerve preparations, reasoning that if Schwann cells are syn-
thesizing PMP-22, a signal should be observed with a lon-
gitudinal periodicity corresponding to the length of the inter-
nodal segment. Such an anticipated periodicity is evident in
Fig . 10 c which shows PMP-22 mRNA localized to the
perinuclear cytoplasm of a Schwann cell from a single my-
elin internode. This result was confirmed using double label-
ing combining in situ hybridization for PMP-22 mRNA and
immunoperoxidase staining for S-100 protein, a specific
marker for Schwann cells in peripheral nerves (Stefansson et
al., 1982) . In control experiments (not shown), the in situ
hybridization procedure selectively diminished the subse-
quent immunostaining for the S-100 protein in the cytoplasm
more than the nucleus, although specific staining of the
nuclei could clearly be seen . The double-labeling studies
demonstrated that S-100 positive Schwann cells also produce
PMP-22 mRNA (Fig . 10 a) . While all of the S-100 positive
cells appear to express PMP-22 mRNA, there is a small

population of cells that are producing PMR22 but do not
stain for S-100. These PMP-22+/S-100- cells may represent
rare fibroblasts or Schwann cells whose nuclei are out of the
plane of section . In teased nerve preparations, occasionally
more t4an one nucleus was observed associated with a single
internodal myelin segment, but there was never more than
one cell per internode that hybridized with PMP-22 anti-
sense mRNA . Thus, we conclude that Schwann cells are
responsible for synthesizing most, if not all of PMP-22 . We
cannot exclude, however, the possibility that there is a small
population of other cell types expressing PMP-22 .
Discussion
In this report, we have established that the recently described
PMP-22 gene product is a component ofperipheral myelin .
This conclusion is based, in part, on immunohistochemistry
and in situ mRNA hybridization studies which indicate that
PMR22 mRNA is produced predominantly by Schwann
cells and that the PMR22 protein is localized to the compact
portion of the myelin sheath . The assignment of PMP-22 as
a peripheral myelin protein is further supported by the
finding that the regulation of PMP-22 expression during de-
velopment and after nerve injury is similar to that of other
myelin proteins .
The pattern of PMP-22 expression in the PNS during de-
velopment is essentially identical to other proteins of PNS
myelin, such as PO and MBP (Stahl et al., 1990 ; Wiggins et
al., 1975 ; Lees and Brostoff, 1984) . Comparative side by
side immunohistochemical localizations of PMP-22 and
MBP during development reveal identical patterns ofexpres-
sion and correlate well with the formation of peripheral my-
elin as demonstrated using toluidine blue-stained plastic
sections . Previous studies havealso shown that PO has a simi-
lar pattern of expression as MBP (and therefore PMP-22)
during the development of the PNS (Garbay et al ., 1989 ;
Stahl et al., 1990) . In the CNS, however, PMP-22 expression
does not correlate with development and the formation of
CNS myelin . The lack of regulation of PMP-22 expression
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 117, 1992
in the CNS is in marked contrast to the upregulation of the
major CNS myelin protein, PLP, during CNS development .
Gardinier et al . (1986) have shown that PLP mRNA is pres-
ent in the CNS at 3 d after birth and reaches a broad peak
at 2 to 4 wk of age. This expression pattern correlates well
with the progression of rat CNS myelin formation . Thus,
during the myelination period in the rat CNS, PLP mRNA
increases from undetectable at birth to adult levels by 28-d
postpartum (Naismith et al., 1985), while PMR22 mRNA
levels are unchanged and PMR22 protein is undetectable .
Interestingly, PLP mRNA and protein have been detected in
the peripheral nervous system although the PLP protein ap-
parently is not incorporated into PNS myelin (Puckett et al .,
1987) . In the PNS, PLP mRNA levels are not regulated dur-
ing development and after nerve injury (Gupta et al., 1991),
analogous to that reported here for PMR22 mRNA in the
CNS .
The pattern of expression of PMR22 in the distal nerve
stump after unilateral sciatic nerve crush was also compara-
ble to the expression of other PNS myelin proteins . Trapp
et al . (1988) have shown that, like PMP-22 mRNA, the
mRNA encoding MBP and PO decreased 40-fold by 5 d after
crush injury. By 21 d after nerve injury, the MBP and PO
mRNA levels began to increase again although no morpho-
logically detectable regeneration was observed (Trapp et al .,
1988) . Similarly, we show in this study that PMP-22 mRNA
and protein expression are rising at 21 d after crush, a time
at which we and others (Nichols et al., 1968) were able to
observe axon sprouting . Trapp et al . (1988) also demon-
strated that PO immunoreactivity, like PMR22 and MBP
shown here, was localized to degenerating myelin ovoids at
21 d after crush injury. Interestingly, PO expression is not
completely repressed by loss of axonal contact as demon-
strated by long-term tissue culture studies which indicated
that small amounts of PO are expressed constitutively by ma-
ture Schwann cells (Poduslo and Windebank, 1985) . Given
its possible role in cellular growth arrest, it would be ofcon-
siderable interest to determinine if PMP-22 was constitu-
tively expressed in mature nonmyelinating Schwann cells .

a perinuclear localization of PMP-22 mRNA at the center of the myelin segment (the internode) between two nodes of Ranvier (arrowheads) from an individual myelinated nerve fiber (c) .
Nerve fibers reacted with the labeled sense probe showed no hybridization signal (d) . Teased nerves are counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin . Bar, 25 Am .
Overall, our results suggest that the regulation of PMP-22 af-
ter nerve injury is similar to other peripheral myelin pro-
teins .
We have previously shown that PMP-22 (SR13) has se-
quence homology with two partial peptide sequences of
PASII, a glycoprotein isolated from PNS myelin prepara-
tions . Although the reported molecular weight of PASII
(13,000, more recently 19,000 ; Uyemura and Kitamura,
1991) is considerably different from PMP-22, the sequence
identity, data indicating that PASII and PMP-22 are glycopro-
teins (see below), and the fact that PASII and, now, PMP-22
have been shown to be PNS specific, indicate that PASII
and PMP-22 are very likely to be identical proteins . It is a
plausible explanation that the smaller observed molecular
weight of PASII may be due to proteolytic degradation . If
PASII and PMP-22 are indeed the same protein, it is of in-
terest that PASII (PMP-22) has been isolated from purified
myelin preparations and identified as one of four major PNS
myelin proteins (Uyemura et al., 1978) . Densitometric scan-
ning of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels of hu-
man peripheral myelin proteins suggest that the levels of the
comigrating PMP-22 and P2 proteins may be up to 10-20%
that of PO (Uyemura and Kitamura, 1991) . This notion is fur-
ther supported by the high abundance of PMP-22 cDNA
clones in a sciatic nerve library (De Leon et al., 1991) and
the relative ease of PMP-22 detection in immunoblots using
low quantities of sciatic nerve homogenates . We conclude
that PMP-22 is a major component of PNS myelin .
The assertion that PMP-22 is a major component of the
PNS myelin sheath raises the question why this protein has
not been widely recognized earlier. Although we cannot offer
a definitive answer, there are several features of PMP-22 that
may have obscured its detection . First, PMP-22 has an ap-
parent molecular weight of 22,000 and thus would be ex-
pected to comigrate with the high molecular weight MBP
(21 .5 kD) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as suggested by Uye-
mura et al . (1979) and does comigrate with another periph-
eral myelin protein, P2 (Uyemura and Kitamura, 1991) . Sec-
ondly, during two dimensional-PAGE analysis of PMP-22,
we noticed a tendency of PMP-22 to form aggregates in the
absence of SDS which could possibly be attributed to the
highly hydrophobic nature of the PMP-22 protein (data not
shown) . Similar unusual biochemical characteristics are de-
scribed for other myelin proteins (e.g ., PLP ; see Agrawal
and Hartman, 1980) .
Comparison of the details of PMP-22 mRNA and protein
localization with other proteins expressed by Schwann cells
provides additional insight into the probable localization of
PMP-22 within the myelin sheath . First, the perinuclear in
situ mRNA localization of PMP-22 in the nerve tease prepa-
ration and on tissue sections is consistent with the hypothesis
that PMP-22 is an integral membrane protein . Two patterns
of mRNA localization for other myelin proteins have been
described ; namely, a perinuclear localization exemplified by
PO and PLP mRNAs and a diffuse cytoplasmic localization,
often prominent in the paranodal regions of the Schwann
cell, as demonstrated for MBP mRNA (Trapp et al., 1987;
Griffiths et al ., 1989) . These patterns of mRNA expression
are thought to reflect the fact that PO and PLP are integral
membrane proteins and must undergo intracellular process-
ing through the RER and Golgi apparatus as opposed to the
soluble MBPs which are presumably synthesized on free
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 117, 1992
ribosomes (Trapp et al ., 1987) . In support ofthis hypothesis,
Lamperth et al . (1990) have provided a direct demonstration
of PO mRNA processing using mRNA hybridization at the
ultrastructural level to show that PO mRNA is localized to
the RER . Secondly, we noticed by immunohistochemistry
that PMP-22 was not highly expressed in the Schwann cell
cytoplasm and was excluded from the cytoplasmic invagina-
tions into the myelin sheath known as Schmidt-Lanterman
incisures . Such a pattern of expression is reciprocal to that
ofproteins like S-100, which is found in the Schwann cell nu-
cleus, cytoplasm (Stefansson et al ., 1982), and Schmidt-
Lanterman incisures (unpublished observations) . Additional
evidence that PMP-22 is an integral membrane protein is
provided by analysis of the PMPR22 amino acid sequence
which reveals four hydrophobic stretches that may function
as transmembrane spanning regions as well as a consensus
site for N-linked glycosylation . gas3 mRNA (PMP-22)
translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes has been
shown to produce a endoglycosidase H-sensitive, proteinase
K-insensitive protein (Manfioletti et al ., 1990) . Taken to-
gether, these studies suggest that PMP-22 is a transmem-
brane glycoprotein expressed in PNS myelin and, as such,
probably has domains which project into both the major
dense line and the intraperiod line of myelin .
The protein composition of CNS and PNS myelin are
significantly different . There is, however, a pervasive notion
in the literature that both myelin structures are sufficiently
similar that two sets of analogous proteins serving similar
functions must exist in both systems . According to this para-
digm, PO has been proposed to be the PNS homologue of
PLP. This hypothesis was based on the fact that both proteins
are relatively abundant, have similar molecular masses (PLP
= 30,000, Lemke, 1988 ; PO = 28,000, Sakamoto et al.,
1987) and display reciprocal patterns of expression in PNS
and CNS . In addition, the glycoprotein PO is a member of
the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of cell surface recep-
tors (Lemke and Axel, 1985) and has been proposed to bind
apposing membranes of the myelin sheath intraperiod line
(contiguous with the extracellular space) through homo-
philic mechanisms (Lemke, 1988) . PLP may have a similar
function in the CNS as suggested by studies of thejimpy mu-
tation, a point mutation of a splice acceptor site in the PLP
gene (Hudson et al ., 1987) which causes specific intraperiod
line abnormalities in affected mice. Structurally, however,
PLP and PO are quite dissimilar . PLP contains four highly
hydrophobic regions and has been proposed to have up to
four membrane-spanning regions (Popot et al., 1991) . P0, on
the other hand, has a relatively hydrophobic, but glycosyl-
ated, extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain,
and a very basic cytoplasmic domain (Sakamoto et al., 1987;
Lemke and Axel, 1985) . As shown here, PMP-22 also dis-
plays a reciprocal pattern of expression compared to PLP
and, like PLP, has four hydrophobic domains which may
serve as membrane-spanning regions . Thus, we propose that
PMP-22 may serve, at least in part, as the PNS analogue of
PLP.
It was one ofthe goals ofthis study to examine the correla-
tion of PMP-22 expression with Schwann cell proliferation
because of the hypothesized role ofgas3 (PMP-22) in cellu-
lar growth arrest . gas3 mRNA is induced in quiescent
(growth-arrested) fibroblasts and is repressed in proliferating
cells (Schneider et al., 1988 ; Ciccarelli et al ., 1990) . Our
236
studies reveal no relationship between PMP-22 expression in
the CNS and the oligodendrocyte proliferation which occurs
postnatally in the rat . In the PNS, however, PMP-22 expres-
sion correlates inversely with Schwann cell division during
development . The situation after nerve injury is less clear .
Pelligrino and Spencer (1985) examined Schwann
cell
proliferation after nerve injury using [3H]thymidine uptake
visualized by autoradiography. Two peaks of Schwann cell
proliferation were identified . The first peak appeared at N5 d
after injury and the second coincided with axon-glial contact
(Pellegrino et al ., 1982) . Trapp et al . (1988) also noted that
the density of Schwann cells in the distal nerve stump after
nerve injury increased between 5-20 d . Our results demon-
strate that PMP-22 mRNA expression is minimal 5 d after
nerve injury and starts to increase by -20 d after crush in-
jury. The decrease in PMP-22 protein level lags significantly
behind the mRNA such that there is still a significant amount
of PMP-22 protein detectable by immunoblot during the first
10 d after nerve injury . Our immunohistochemistry results
indicate that most ofthe PMP-22 protein observed during the
second week after nerve crush injury is localized to degener-
ating myelin ovoids where it may be unavailable to serve a
regulatory function . These results can be interpreted in sev-
eral ways : First, PMP-22 (gas3) expression may not be
directly related to in vivo growth regulation and may reflect
irrelevant gene transcription in tissue culture . Indeed, there
is no direct evidence that gas3 is involved in regulating
growth arrest . Alternatively, however, since PMP-22 mRNA
(and to a lesser extent, protein) expression is correlated with
the differentiation of Schwann cells, it remains possible that
PMP-22 RNA negatively regulates cell division in Schwann
cells as well as in other cell types . To accomodate the latter
hypothesis, we would speculate that the lack of correlation of
PMP-22 mRNA expression with the second wave of Schwann
cell division during nerve regeneration is because ofdilution
of the relatively small number of Schwann cells in contact
with the advancing tips of regenerating axons as compared
with the whole nerve sample. Although we do not have direct
evidence to support the idea that PMP-22 serves as both a
myelin protein and as a regulator of cell growth, it should
be pointed out that oligodendrocytes from mutant mice de-
ficient in PLP (jimpy) proliferate more rapidly than normal
(Skoff, 1982), but most of these cells ultimately die (Knapp
et al ., 1986) . The existence of these mutations suggests that
PLP may play a more fundamental role in oligodendrocyte
biology than functioning as a myelin structural protein .
Likewise, the possibility remains that PMP-22 may also sub-
serve a similar dual function .
In conclusion, these studies indicate that the PMP-22 pro-
tein is synthesized by Schwann cells and is a major compo-
nent of PNS, but not CNS myelin . Like other myelin pro-
teins, PMP-22 mRNA and protein expression is actively
regulated and correlates with myelin production during
periods of myelination and Wallerian degeneration . Exami-
nation of the predicted structure of the PMP-22 protein re-
veals similarities to the predicted structure of PLP The fact
that both proteins have multiple membrane-spanning do-
mains suggests that these proteins project into both the major
dense line and the intraperiod line of myelin where they may
serve similar functions . Whether PMP-22 or PLP are in-
volved in the regulation ofthe cell cycle awaits further inves-
tigations .

The Effect of Immunosuppressive Agents on the
Induction of Nuclear Factors that Bind to Sites on the
Interleukin 2 Promoter
By Angela Granelli-Piperno, Patricia Nolan, Kayo Inaba,
and Ralph M . Steinman
From the Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology, and Irvington Institute, The
Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10021
Summary
Cyclosporin A (CSA), FK506, and glucocorticosteroids all inhibit the production of lymphokines
by decreasing lymphokine gene expression . Previous experiments have defined six different sites
that may contribute to the transcriptional control of the interleukin 2 (IL2) promoter, and for
each, active nuclear binding factors are induced upon mitogenic stimulation . While dexamethasone
markedly blocks the increase in IL2 mRNA in stimulated human blood T cells, we found that
the drug does not block the appearance of factors that bind to the transcriptional control sites
termed AP-1, AP-3, NF-kB, OCT1, B site, and NF-AT. In contrast, both CSA and FK506 have
similar effects : the drugs cause modest decreases in AP-3 and NF-kB, and marked decreases in
the activity of AP-1 and NF-AT Therefore, CSA and FK506, while chemically different, seem
to act upon a similar pathway that leads to IL2 gene expression, whereas glucocorticoids do
not affect this pathway.
variety of immunosuppressants block T cell prolifera
A tion and lymphokine production . A major site of ac-
tion of these immunosuppressive drugs is at the level of lym
phokine gene expression . This was noted first for cyclosporin
A (CSA) (1-4), which acts primarily at the level of lym-
phokines rather than other components of T cell activation,
such as the p55 IL2R and cfos (2) . Two other drugs, dexa-
methasone and FK506, also act primarily at the level of 11,2
gene expression (5-7) . It is likely that glucocorticoids have
a different mechanism of action than CSA and FK506, since
steroids affect many cell types, whereas CSA and FK506 are
more T cell restricted .
To gain more insight into the mechanism ofaction of im-
munosuppressive drugs, we have taken advantage of recent
progress in defining nuclear factors that bind to the IL2 pro-
moter. An activation-dependent enhancer within sequences
-326 to -52 of the 5' flanking region of the IL2 gene has
been identified (for review see reference 8) . In this enhancer
reside several elements common to other genes, like the NFkB,
AP-1, AP-3, and OCT-1 sites, as well as a site that seems re-
stricted to activated lymphoid cells and is called the nuclear
factor for activated T cells (NF-AT) (9) . Here, we report the
induction of these nuclear factors in primary populations of
human blood T cells . We show that FK-506 and CSA
markedly inhibit the activation of factors that bind to the
AP-1 and NF-AT sites, whereas dexamethasone has no effect
on all six nuclear binding factors tested .

Materials and Methods
Cell Cultures.
Briefly, human mononuclear cells were isolated from
huffy coats on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients, washed in PBS,
and rosetted with neuraminidase-treated sheep erythrocytes. The
rosette-positive fraction was further purified by passage over a nylon
wool column and used as a source of T cells . T cells were cultured
at 5 x 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated FCS, 20,ug/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 5 x 10-5 M
2-ME . Cells were stimulated with PHA (Gibco Laboratories, Grand
Island, NY) at 1 Rg/ml and PMA (Sigma Chemical Co., St . Louis,
MO) at 5 ng/ml in the presence or absence ofCSA or CSH (Sandoz,
Basel, Switzerland) at 1 hg/ml ; FK506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical
Co . Ltd ., Osaka, Japan) at 100 ng/ml ; or dexamethasone (Sigma
Chemical Co.) at 10-7 M .
Nuclear Extracts.
These were prepared from 2-4 x 108 T cells
by homogenization in two-cell pellet volumes of 10 mM Hepes,
pH 7.9, 10 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCIZ , 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM
DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 10% glycerol (10) . Nuclei were cen-
trifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min, washed, and resuspended in two
volumes of the above solution . 3 M KCI was added drop by drop
to reach 0.39 M KCI . Nuclei were extracted at 4°C for 1 h and
centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min . The supernatants were dia-
lyzed in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7 .9, 50 mM KCI, 20% glycerol, 0.5
mM PMSF, and 1 mM EDTA, and""then clarified by centrifugation
and stored at -80°C. Protein concentration was determined using
the Bradford method .
DNA-Protein Binding Assay.
0.2 ng (-10' cpm) ofend-labeled
DNA fragments were incubated at room temperature for 20 min
with 5-10 jug of nuclear protein in the presence of 2 pg Poly(dl-

dC) in 20 jl of 10 mM Tris HCI, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1mM DTT, and 5% glycerol (this buffer was used for NF-
kB, NF-AT, and B sites) . For AP-1, AP-3, and OCT-1 sites, the
buffer was 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 4% Ficoll, 2.5 MM MgCIZ,
1 mM DTT, and 40 mM KC1. Protein-DNA complexes were sepa-
rated from free probe on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25x TBE
at 150 V for 1.5 h at room temperature
. The gels were dried and
exposed to X-ray film . For each site, we verified that a 20-fold molar
excess of specific cold oligonucleotide would compete the binding
of proteins to a radiolabeled probe, whereas a similar excess from
another site would not.

Suppression of Interleukin 2 Transcription Factors
Figure 1.
Effects of CSA on the
induction of nuclear factors that
bind to elements of the 11,2 en-
hancer. Human bloodT cells were
left unstimulated (Unst) or were
stimulated with PHA (1 gg/ml) and
PMA (5 ng/ml) (PIP) in the pres-
ence or absence of CSA or the
nonimmunosuppressive
analogue
CSH (1 Ftg/ml) . After 5 h, the cells
were collected and nuclear extracts
prepared . 10 Rg of nuclear proteins
were incubated with 0.2 ng of the
indicated 32P end-labeled oligonu-
cleotides. Protein-DNA complexes
(arrows) were separated from free oli-
gonucleotide (lower part of each
lane) in low ionic strength 4% poly-
acrylamide gels .
DNA Probes .
Oligonucleotides were synthesized by The Rock-
efeller University Facility with a DNA synthesizer (Applied Bio-
systems, Inc., Foster City, CA). The following probes were used :
the NF-AT binding site, -254 to -285 of the IL-2 promoter,
5'-GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT3' (9) ; the
NF-kB binding site, -206 to -195 region of the 11,2 promoter,
5'-GGGATTTCACCT3' (11); the OCT-1 binding site, 5'-ACT
CTTCACCTTATTTGCATAAGCGATTCTA 3', used for the pur-
ification of the OTF-1 transcription factor and kindly provided by
Dr. N . Heintz (The Rockefeller University); the AP-1 binding site,
-157 to -140 of the IL2 promoter, 5'-TTCCAAAGAGTCAT

Effects ofFK506 on the
induction of nuclear factors that
bind to elements of the 11,2 en-
hancer. The experiments were the
same as those in Fig . 1, except that
FK506 (100 ng/ml) was used as the
immunosuppressant,
and nuclear
extracts from Hela cells were also
tested . Arrows indicate the specific
DNA-protein complexes.

CAG3' (11) ; the AP-3binding site used for the purification ofAP-3,
5'-TGTGGAAAGTCCCA-3' (12) ; and the B site, -82 to -67 of
the 11,2 promoter, 5'-TAATATGTAAAACATT3' (13) . Probes were
labeled with [32p]ATP.
Results and Discussion
DNA-nuclear protein interactions were monitored with
standard electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) . Ex-
tracts of nuclei from mitogen stimulated T cells were pre-
pared 5 h after application of the mitogen in the presence
or absence of an immunosuppressive drug. Resting T cells
did not contain active factors that bind to the NF-AT, NF-
kB, AP-1, AP-3, and B sites, but these activities were induced
by stimulation with PHA and PMA (Fig. 1) . The immunosup-
pressive CSA, but not the nonimmunosuppressive analogue
CSH, markedly inhibited the induction ofNF-AT and AP-1,
but only partially blocked induction of NF-kB and AP-3 (Fig.
1) . Inhibition by CSA of NF-AT was also observed in stimu-
lated Jurkat cells (14) . The fact that CSA primarily acts on
NF-AT and AP-1 is of interest . Both are distinct from other
transcription factors in requiring new protein synthesis as well
as two signals, in this case lectin plus PMA (Granelli-Piperno,
A., manuscript submitted for publication) .
Figure 4.
Effects ofdexamethasone on the induction ofnuclear factors
that bind to elements of the IL2 enhancer. The experiments were the same
as those in Fig . 1, except that dexamethasone (10 -7 M) was used as the
immunosuppressive . Arrows indicate the specific DNA-protein complexes .
We next examined the effect of another immunosuppres-
sive drug, FK506 . FK506, like CSA, inhibits T cell prolifer-
ation and IL2 gene expression (5), which we confirmed.
FK506 proved to be similar to CSA at the level of nuclear
transcription factors. The inductions of NF-AT and AP-1 were
markedly reduced, whereas AP-3, NF-kB, OCT1, and the
factor that binds to the B site were not (Fig . 2) . We simul-
taneously evaluated extracts of HeLa cell nuclei . These con-
tained all the nuclear factors that were inducible in T cells,
except for NF-AT, thus confirming that NF-AT is at T cell-re-
stricted activity.
In additional experiments, CSA and FK506 blocked the
induction ofnuclear factors in response to the other mitogens,
anti-CD3 (not shown) or anti-CD28 mAb (Fig. 3) . Some
authors find that stimulation with anti-CD28 is CSA resis-
tant (15), but we noted that CSA reduced the induction of
IL2 mRNA as well as nuclear factors that bind the IL-2 pro-
moter (16) (Fig. 3) .
We last tested dexamethasone, a glucocorticosteroid that
also inhibits the increase in IL2 mRNA that occurs during
mitogenesis (6, 7) . While the drug clearly blocks the induc-
tion of IL-2 mRNA (not shown), dexamethasone did not
alter the induction of any of the factors that bind to the ele-
ments we have examined (Fig. 4) . These data indicate that
the 1172 transcriptional control pathway that is suppressed
by glucocorticoids is different from that of CsA and FK506 .

Summary
The peak incidence of Hodgkin's disease occurs during the reproductive age, and its association
with pregnancy is at a rate of between 1:1,000 - 1:6,000. We studied the effects of Hodgkin's Disease on the
course and survival of 48 women who had Hodgkin's Disease and who were pregnant, and compared their
outcome with non-pregnant matched women who were of similar stage of disease, age at diagnosis, and
calenderic
year of treatment. Twenty-year survival of pregnant women with Hodgkin's Disease was not
different from that of their matched controls. Pregnant women with Hodgkin's Disease had similar distribu-
tion of stages to the controls.
Because the peak incidence of Hodgkin's Disease (HD) is in
the age range 20-40 years, its association with pregnancy is
not
uncommon,
occurring
in
1:1,000-1:6,000
deliveries
(Ward & Weiss, 1989). Early studies reported a higher fre-
quency of relapse and lower survival rates in HD patients
who were pregnant (Southman et al., 1956). Later publica-
tions
rejected
this
conclusion,
claiming
that
pregnancy
neither exacerbates the disease nor adversely affects survival
(Stewart & Monto, 1952; Riva et al., 1953; Barry et al., 1962;
Gobbi et al., 1984; Tawil et al., 1984; Nisce et al., 1986). The
view that pregnancy does not affect the course of Hodgkin's
disease and the disease does not affect the course of preg-
nancy has become widely accepted and repeatedly stressed in
reviews and textbooks (Ward & Weiss,
1989;
Sutcliffe &
Chapman, 1985; Becker, 1968). However, this conclusion is
based on single
cases
or
a surprisingly small number of
uncontrolled studies (Barry et al., 1962; Gobbi et al., 1984;
Tawil et al., 1984; Nisce et al., 1986).
It is unlikely that prospective controlled studies will ever
be undertaken to further explore the interaction between HD
and pregnancy; therefore, we performed an historical cohort
study to evaluate the influence of pregnancy on HD and that
of HD on pregnancy among women treated at the Princess
Margaret Hospital (PMH) between 1958-1984. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the only controlled study of HD
and pregnancy. In addition, this study is unique in providing
information on foetal outcome.
Methods
All patients with histologically confirmed Hodgkin's disease,
registered
in
the
Princess
Margaret
Hospital
between
1958-1984 were identified. PMH
is an oncologic hospital
serving the Province of Ontario. Cases with HD in pregnancy
were identified by extracting from the database all women
who had HD, where the woman was pregnant within 9
months prior to or 3 months after the first treatment. Based
on the assumption that cancer would be present for some
time before it could be diagnosed, 9 months was chosen to
reflect
the normal
gestational period and
3 months
was
chosen arbitrarily to make the width of the time frame
1
year. The day of the first treatment was used only to extract
the patients from the database because dates of diagnosis
were not always recorded in the Princess Margaret Hospital
(PMH) computer. For the purposes of the study, the date of
diagnosis was used as a reference date after the charts had
been examined.
Potential
cases
were
further screened by
examining
their charts
to verify that pregnancy and HD
occurred within the time frame stated above and to reject
patients who had an ectopic pregnancy.
To study the effects of pregnancy on the course of HD, we
matched women having HD in pregnancy to non-pregnant
women with the disease. For each pregnant case, an attempt
was made to identify three matched controls in the PMH
database according to the following criteria:
(1) The control women had to be within 2 years of age of
the pregnant cases at diagnosis and could not have
been pregnant within 15 months prior to or 9 months
after first treatment.
(2) Controls had the same Ann Arbor stage of HD as
cases at diagnosis (Hermanek & Sobin, 1987).
(3) Controls had the same presence or absence of B symp-
toms as cases at diagnosis (fever, night sweats, and/or
weight loss of more than 10% of the original weight 6
months prior to first attendance).
(4) Controls were diagnosed within 2 calenderic years of
the associated case. It was assumed that controls would
have similar staging procedures and treatment proto-
cols as the cases if controls were of same age, stage,
and calendaric
year of diagnosis
as the
cases. The
validity of this assumption was verified in a random
sample of ten pregnant women and 23 controls and
was true 96% of the time.
Data describing patient characteristics with HD including
date of diagnosis, staging, and presence
or absence of B
symptoms were extracted from the charts of both cases and
controls. Dates and types of treatment, including treatment
delays, were also recorded. Obstetrical information, including
date of conception, gestational age at diagnosis and at first
treatment, complications in pregnancy and its outcome were
also recorded.
For cases whose pregnancies continued to term or resulted
in stillbirth, birth records were requested from the delivering
hospital. For live births, sex and birth weight of the infant
were recorded, as well as gestational age at delivery, type of
delivery, foetal complications and congenital anomalies. For
intrauterine death, date of diagnosis of the
stillbirth and
autopsy results were collected.
Live births were compared to those of infants born to
women attending the Motherisk Program at The Hospital for
Sick
Children
in Toronto,
following
exposure
to
drugs,
chemicals, or radiation during the first trimester of pregnancy
(Koren & MacLeod, 1986). For this analysis, each mother
with HD was matched to a mother of similar age who was
exposed to non-teratogenic drugs or chemicals.
Statistical analysis
Cause-specific
survival
curves
were
produced
using
the
Kaplan-Meier estimate (Kaplan & Meier,
1958). For the

purposes of this paper, cause-specific survival is defined as
mortality due to the disease under investigation. Any death
caused by
other than
the
disease under
investigation
is
treated as censored. The Mantel-Haenszel logrank test was
employed to test for differences between survival curves (Peto
et al., 1977). A chi-square test was utilised to compare the
distribution of stages upon diagnosis between the cases and
the non-pregnant women having HD during the reproductive
age registered in the PMH database and to verify that the
crtieria for matching was similar in cases and controls. The
Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple com-
parisons. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the effect of
stage on maternal outcome between
cases and
controls.
Foetal outcome values between the study and control groups
were
compared
using
a
two-sided
Student's
t-test
for
independent samples and chi-square tests whenever appropri-
ate. The odds ratio was used to estimate the relative risk of
pregnant women with HD to have a stillbirth compared to
pregnant woman without cancer having a stillbirth in the
province
of Ontario
(Schlesselman,
1982).
The
observed
number of stillbirths was assumed to follow a Poisson distri-
bution.
Statistical analysis was performed with the aid of
SAS version 5.1 and Minitab release 6.1.1.
Results
Forty-eight women with HD and pregnancy were identified
in the PMH database between 1958-1984. Two women had
two pregnancies, each fitting in the time frame of the study,
resulting in 50 pregnancies in 48 women. The mean age of
women with HD was 26.1 + / - 4.9 years (median 25 years
and a range of 18 to 38 years). Of the 50 pregnancies, 12
(24%) were diagnosed with HD before conception, 10 (20%)
during
pregnancy,
and
27
(54%)
were
diagnosed
after
delivery or pregnancy termination. For one pregnancy this
information was unavailable.
Treatment
modalities
of
the
48
women
included
radiotherapy alone
(n = 31), chemotherapy alone
(n = 6),
and combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy (n = 11). Of
those women diagnosed
before
or during the pregnancy
(n = 22), 16 women received radiation while pregnant, one
received chemotherapy during the first trimester, and five
received combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy while
pregnant. One patient delayed treatment due to pregnancy.
She had received radiotherapy while pregnant and delayed
chemotherapy until after delivery.
Of the 48 cases, 67 matched controls were found for 33
women. Three controls per patient could not always be
obtained because of the selectivity of the matching criteria.
For 15 cases, matched controls could not be found. This
unmatched group was not statistically significantly different
from
the
matched
group
when
compared
by
survival
(P = 0.6).
Maternal outcome
Using a cause-specific Kaplan-Meier survival curve, the 20-
year survival of the 33
cases was compared
to their 67
matched
controls
(Figure
1). No
statistically
significant
difference was found between these groups (P = 0.6). At the
time of the study, eight of the cases had died of HD while
the remaining 25 were either alive or died of other causes. In
the control group, 12 women died of HD.
We subsequently compared survival in the subgroup of
patients who were diagnosed with HD prior to conception or
during the pregnancy and had matched controls (n = 17)
with their matched controls. No
statistical difference was
found (P = 0.6).
When the effect of individual stage of HD on maternal
survival was analysed, no significant differences were found
between cases and controls (P >0.1 for each comparison).
To evaluate whether increasing age
at diagnosis had an
adverse impact on maternal cause-specific survival, we com-

In an attempt to verify whether pregnancy affected the
stage of HD upon diagnosis, we compared the distribution of
stages between our cases with that of non-pregnant women
younger than 38 years registered in the PHM database dur-
ing the same time period (1958-1984). Of the 48 pregnant
women,
12 (25%) had
stage

disease
at
diagnosis,
22
(45.8%) stage 2, 8 (16.7%) stage 3, and 6 (12.5%) had stage
4. Of the 529 non-pregnant women identified in the com-
puterised database, 79 (15%) had stage 1 disease, 257 (49%)
stage 2, 106 (20%) stage 3, and 87 (16%) had stage 4. No
statistically
significant difference was found between these
two distributions (P > 0.25, after adjusting for multiple com-
parisons).
Pregnancy outcome
Of the 50 pregnancies studied, there were 40 deliveries (two
of
which
were
stillbirths),
five
miscarriages,
and
four
therapeutic abortions. The outcome of one pregnancy was
unknown.
Of the 38 live births, we were able to obtain 22 obstetrical
records and two autopsy reports from the delivering hospitals
(the remaining were unavailable due to unidentified deliver-
ing hospitals, destroyed birth records, or refusal to release
confidential documents). However, in some additional cases,
the maternal charts reported details of pregnancy outcome
(Table I).
No differences were found between the babies born to
women with HD when compared to the Motherisk matched
controls
in
birth weight (P = 0.7), mean gestational
age
(P = 0.3) or method of delivery (P = 0.5). One malformation
was identified: This was a child with hydrocephaly born to a
mother whose HD was diagnosed before conception. She was
treated only by combination chemotherapy (MOPP - Nit-
rogen mustard, Oncovin, Prednisone, Procarbazine) during
the first trimester.
Of the 22 babies born and exposed in utero to HD therapy
(n = 15), one was exposed to chemotherapy during the first
trimester of pregnancy, one was exposed to chemotherapy
and radiation after the first trimester, six were exposed to
radiation during the first trimester of pregnancy, and seven
were exposed to radiation after the first trimester.
We compared the number of stillbirths in our group (two
per 40 total births) to that of the general population of
Ontario (11.3 stillbirths per 1,000 total births) (Province of
Ontario Vital Statistics, 1960-1984). The difference was not
statistically significant (P = 0.076).

Discussion
The diagnosis of HD in pregnancy puts immense stress on
pregnant women, their families and on physicians caring for
them. Potential harm to the woman from delayed diagnosis,
staging or therapy, and the risk to the baby from radiation
or chemotherapy creates serious pressure and a need for
prompt decisions. For such choices to be authoritative, they
must be based on large experience, which is lacking in any
particular centre due to the relative rareness of the combina-
tion of HD and pregnancy.
Most published studies suffer from major problems that
make them difficult to interpret and cast doubt on their
validity. First, some of the frequently references studies were
performed decades ago (Stewart & Monto, 1952; Barry et al.,
1962; Kadson, 1949; Bichel, 1950; Myles, 1955). Since the
diagnostic tools, staging methods, and especially treatment
modalities have progressed tremendously in recent years, it is
difficult
to extrapolate these
results
to the present time.
Second, most studies do not compare matched controls but
rather compare pregnant women with a nonmatched cohort
of nonpregnant women with HD (Barry et al., 1962; Gobbi
et al., 1984). Such reports carry a substantial risk of bias
since the groups compared may be unbalanced for significant
prognostic factors and thus the analysis may be misleading.
Finally, some papers provide case reports or a summary of
an experience with a small number of patients (Howard et
al., 1978; Jacobs et al., 1981; Morgan et al., 1976). Although
these reports are important, they cannot be used as guidelines
for a rational clinical approach for these patients. In contrast
to previous work, our study is the first to use a case-control
method to study the outcome of pregnant women with HD.
It is based on a significant number of patients that were
carefully matched for the recognised and important prognos-
tic factors of HD (Ward & Weiss, 1989). In addition, patients
and controls were staged according to modern recommenda-
tions.
Our study did not detect an effect of pregnancy on survival
of women with HD, as their long term prognosis was iden-
tical
to
that of their matched
controls.
Moreover,
this
analysis reveals that the pregnant women is not more likely
to be at a higher stage (more advanced disease) than women
of reproductive age in general. This indicates that pregnancy
is not likely to change the biology of the tumour or to
postpone diagnosis. These
results are in contrast
to our
findings with breast cancer, where pregnant women have a
significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with metastatic
disease (stage 4) (Zemlickis et al., in press).
Our study
is the first to provide data regarding foetal
outcome by analysing infants born to women with HD dur-
ing pregnancy. We found that infants born to women with
HD did not have a higher risk for prematurity or intrauterine
growth retardation. Conversely, babies born to women with
breast cancer have been shown by us
to
suffer from a
significant small for gestational age (SGA) risk (Zemlickis et
al.,
in press). The
rate of stillbirth was not
statistically
different from data for Ontario. This may reflect a beta error
due to a small sample size, and larger numbers will be needed
to confirm it.
Although various chemotherapeutic agents have been suc-
cessfully administered during early pregnancy (Nisce et al.,
1986;
Thomas &
Peckham,
1976),
there
is
compelling
evidence
that chemotherapy
has
significant
likelihood
of
adversely affecting the baby during embryogenesis (Lishner &
Koren, in press). The only infant in this series born to a
patient who received chemotherapy during the first trimester
(MOPP-Nitrogen
Mustard,
Oncovin,
Prednisone,
Procar-
bazine) had hydrocephaly and died in early infancy. In con-
trast,
there
is
no
evidence
for
teratogenic
effect
of
chemotherapy delivered during second or third trimester of
pregnancy (Koren et al., 1990; Lishner & Koren, in press). In
our series, one baby was exposed to chemotherapy after the
first trimester and was normal at birth. Much more data are
needed to define the relative foetal risk of chemotherapy
during embryogenesis as well as later.
In summary, this study could not detect adverse effects of
pregnancy on survival of women with HD. Similarly, preg-
nant women are not likely to be at a higher stage of their
disease than their matched controls.

Abstract. Fimbrin is an actin-bundling protein found 
in intestinal microvilli, hair cell stereocilia, and fibro- 
blast filopodia. The complete protein sequence (630 
residues) of chicken intestine fimbrin has been deter- 
mined from two full-length cDNA clones. The se- 
quence encodes a small amino-terminal domain (115 
residues) that is homologous with two calcium-binding 
sites of calmodulin and a large carboxy-terminal do- 
main (500 residues) consisting of a fourfold-repeated 
125-residue sequence. This repeat is homologous with 
the actin-binding domain of alpha-actinin and the 
amino-terminal domains of dystrophin, actin-gelation 
protein, and beta-spectrin. The presence of this dupli- 
cated domain in fimbrin links actin bundling proteins 
and gelation proteins into a common family of actin 
cross-linking proteins. Fimbrin is also homologous in 
sequence with human L-plastin and T-plastin. L-plas- 
tin is found in only normal or transformed leukocytes 
where it becomes phosphorylated in response to IL 1 
or phorbol myristate acetate. T-plastin is found in 
cells of solid tissues where it does not become phos- 
phorylated. Neoplastic cells derived from solid tissues 
express both isoforms. The differences in expression, 
sequence, and phosphorylation suggest possible func- 
tional differences between fimbrin isoforms. 
TIN filaments are commonly organized in the cyto- 
plasm into bundles or gels. Actin bundles are closely 
spaced, parallel arrays of filaments that provide struc- 
tural support for fingerlike extensions of the plasma mem- 
brane such as microvilli, stereocilia, and filopodia. This ar- 
rangement of filaments contrasts with the orthogonal lattice 
of filaments in an actin gel, which compose a subcortical 
scaffold associated with the plasma membrane. Actin bun- 
dles and gels are formed by separate classes of actin cross- 
linking proteins (Pollard and Cooper, 1986). Although these 
proteins must bind actin, it is unknown whether they share 
similar mechanisms of binding and cross-linking actin illa- 
ments. 
Actin gelation proteins consist of a class of large, flexible 
multisubunit molecules that cross-link actin filaments into a 
loosely organized meshwork supporting the plasma mem- 
brane. This network is anchored to the membrane by integral 
and peripheral membrane proteins. Various actin gelation 
proteins, including alpha-actinin (Noegel et al., 1987; Blan- 
chard et al., 1989), actin-binding protein (ABP) 1 (Hartwig 
and Stossel, 1975), filamin (Wang et al., 1975), spectrin 
(Morrow, 1989), and actin gelation protein (Condeelis et al., 
1981; Noegel et al., 1989), have been identified based on 
their ability in vitro to increase the viscosity of actin ilia-

ments. Actin gelation proteins are either dimers or tetra- 
mers. This oligomerization is required for actin cross-link- 
ing activity because monomeric actin-binding domains can 
bind but not cross-link actin filaments (Mimura and Asano, 
1986). Gelation proteins have globular amino- and carboxy- 
terminal domains that are separated by long stretches of 
repeated crossed-beta sheet or alpha-helical segments. Actin 
binding activity in alpha-actinin has been identified in the 
amino-terminal globular (250 residues) domain (Mimura and 
Asano, 1986). This domain has also been identified at the 
amino terminus of the gelation proteins and dystrophin (Ham- 
monds, 1987; Davison and Critchley, 1988). 
Various actin bundling proteins have been purified. They 
include sea urchin egg fascin (Bryan and Kane, 1978), hu- 
man erythrocyte band 4.9 (Siegel and Branton, 1985), and 
rat cell culture 55 kD (Yamashiro-Matsumura and Matsu- 
mura, 1985). Intestinal brush border microvilli contain two 
actin-bundling proteins (Matsudaira and Burgess, 1979), 
fimbrin (Bretscher and Weber, 1980a; Bretscher, 1981; Glen- 
ney et al., 1981) and viUin (Bretscher and Weber, 1980b; Mat- 
sudaira and Janmey, 1988). Fimbrin is distributed widely in 
nonintestinal cell microvilli and filopodia (Bretscher and 
Weber, 1980), whereas villin is restricted to the absorptive 
epithelia covering the surface of the gut, kidney proximal 
tubules, and embryonic visceral yolk sac (Louvard, 1989). 
Because fimbrin, villin, and fascin are monomeric bundling 
proteins, they must contain two actin binding sites; however,

little is known of the sequences or domains involved in form- 
ing a cross-link between actin filaments. 
Because fimbrin and villin bundle actin in the same micro- 
villus, we were interested in comparing fimbrin structure 
with villin. In this paper we describe the complete sequence 
of fimbrin deduced from full-length eDNA clones from 
chicken intestine. The sequence reveals that fimbrin is orga- 
nized, like villin, into headpiece and core domains, but that 
the two proteins are unrelated in sequence. The fimbrin 
headpiece domain lies at the amino terminus and contains 
two calmodulin-like calcium-binding sites. The carboxy- 
terminal core domain consists entirely of a fourfold repeat. 
Each pair of these repeats is homologous to the actin-bind- 
ing domain of alpha-actinin and the putative actin-binding 
domains of dystrophin, actin gelation protein, and beta- 
spectrin. 
Fimbrin is also homologous to human L- and T-plastin, 
68-kD polypeptides of unknown function. L-plastin is ex- 
pressed in the cytoplasm of leukocytes (Goldstein et al., 
1985; Lin et al., 1988, 1990) and in response to IL-1 and 
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) acti-eation, L-plastin is 
phosphorylated at serine residues (Goldstein et al., 1985; 
Anderson et al., 1985; Matsushima et al., 1988). T-plastin 
is constitutively expressed in epithelial and mesenchymal 
cells derived from solid tissues but neoplastic cells from 
these tissues express both plastin isoforms. These results 
identify possible regulation of the membrane-associated 
cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of fimbrin and possible 
functional differences between fimbrin isoforms. 
Materials and Methods 
Fimbrin Proteolysis 
Fimbrin was purified from the supernatant of calcium extracted chicken in- 
testine epithelial cells using methods modified from Glenney et al. (1981b). 
The superuatant was passed through a DNase column to remove villin and 
actin. Fimbrin does not bind to the column and the flow-through fractions 
containing fimbrin were pooled. Fimbrin precipitated in a 45-60% ammo- 
nium sulfate cut and was further purified by gel filtration thorough AeA 34 
and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Fine 
Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ) and AftiGel Blue Agarose (Bio-Rad Laborato- 
ries, Richmond, CA). The purified protein was desalted into 150 mM NaCI, 
1 mM MgCI2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM Pipes buffer (pH 7.25) at a concen- 
tration of 1 mg/ml and digested with papain (1:400 wt/wt) at room tempera- 
ture. Aliquots were removed at t = 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min and 
quenched by addition of PMSF to 0.1 mM and then boiled in SDS sample 
buffer. The digest products were separated by PAGE. 
Amino-Terminal Sequence Analysis 
Purified fimbrin was digested to completion with trypsin. The peptides were 
separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and well-separated peaks were collected 
manually and sequenced using a gas-phase instrument (model 470; Applied 
Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) equipped for on-line analysis of phenyl- 
thiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives of amino acids. Fimbrin core generated by 
mild V-8 proteolysis was electroblotted onto an lmmobilon membrane (Mil- 
lipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described previously (Matsndaira, 1987) 
and the amino terminus was sequenced using a gas phase sequencer (model 
2090E; Porton Instruments, Tarzana, CA) equipped for on-line PTH amino 
acid identification. 
Construction of Chicken Intestine cDNA Library 
RNA was isolated from chicken intestine epithelial cells by the guanidinium 
isothiocyanate method (Chirgwin et al., 1979), and poly(A) + RNA was 
isolated by oligo (dT)-cellulose column chromatography, eDNA was syn- 
thesized from 5 t~g of POly(A) + RNA with Moloney marine leukemia virus 
reverse transeriptase (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) and random primers. Eco 
Rl/Not I linkers were attached and DNA was ligated into ),gtl0 and pack- 
aged in vitro (Gigapack II Plus; Strategene Corp., La Jolla, CA). The total 
library, unamplified, contained 1.9 × 106 recombinants. 
Cloning and Sequencing of Fimbrin eDNA 
A rabbit polyclonal antiserum (R163.3) raised against purified chicken in- 
testine fimbrin was used to screen transformants (10 ~ clones) in a ~gtl I li- 
brary constructed from chicken intestine poly(A)+ RNA (Bazari et al., 
1988). A single clone (SW6) containing an internal ECO RI site was isolated, 
cloned into M13, and sequenced on both strands using dideoxy-chaln termi- 
nation methods. This clone (2.4 kb) contained sequences that matched 
seven peptide sequences derived from V-8 and trypsin digests of chicken in- 
testine fimbrin. SW6 did not contain the complete fimbrin sequence because 
its 5' coding region started in the middle of protein sequences corresponding 
to the NH2 terminus of fimbrin core. An 0.3 kb Xba I/Eco RI restriction 
fragment of clone SW6 was randomly labeled with 32p and used to screen 
2x 105 recombinants plated from the XgtlO library. Nine positive clones 
were isolated. The clones were 1.0-3.7 kb in size and all contained an inter- 
nal Eco RI site. Two clones (M38 and M48) were sequenced on both strands 
as described above and a 1.9-kb open reading frame corresponding to the 
fimbrin protein sequence was identified. The introns in clone M48 were se- 
quenced on one strand. The fimbrin protein sequence was compared with 
the GenBank and NBRF data bases using TFASTA. Sequence homologies 
were further analyzed and aligned using BESTFIT (UWGCG, Devereux et 
al., 1984). 
Northern Blot Analysis 
Poly(A) + RNA (2 #g) isolated from chicken intestine epithelial cells was 
fractionated in formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon mem- 
branes (Biodyne; Pall Corp,, Glen Cove, NY). The membranes were hy- 
bridized with randomly labeled 32p probes generated from restriction 
digests of M38, M48, or SWt, washed with 2x SSC and 0.1% SDS at room 
temperature, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The size of the transcript was 
determined by comparison with 32P-labeled RNA size markers that were 
loaded in adjacent lanes. 
Bacterial Expression of Piastin lsoforms 
The corrected, full-length coding sequence of human L- or T- plastin (Lin 
et al., 1988, 1990) was cloned into the recombinant plasmid pET-3C 
(Studier and Moffat, 1986) having the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and 
transfected into Escherichia coil, Expression was induced with isopropyl-~- 
D-thiogalactopyranoside, Lysates of uninduced and induced bacteria were 
solubilized with SDS sample buffer and subjected to one-dimensional gel 
electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis+ 
Two-dimensional Gel Immunoblots and 
Autoradiography 
Human SCC cells (gift from George Milo, Ohio State University) were la- 
beled for 6 h with [3~S]methionine and subjected to two-dimensional gel 
electrophoresis as previously described (Lin et al., 1988). Proteins were 
electroblotted to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Elec- 
trobiotransfer, Sunnyvale, CA) at a constant current (1.0 mA/cm 2 of gel) 
for 1 h. The filters were stained with Amido black to determine the effec- 
tiveness of protein transfer, incubated with a 1:I,000 dilution of rabbit 
anti-chicken fimbrin antiserum for 17 h, and subsequently incubated with 
peroxidase-conjugated 
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution; Bio-Rad 
Laboratories) for 2 h. The filters were developed to visualize the secondary 
antibody and exposed to x-ray film for 2 and 18 h to identify radioactive 
proteins. 
Plastin lsoform Expression in Different Cell Lines 
Various primary or secondary cell strains established from different tissues 
were assayed for L- and T-plastin expression by Northern blot analysis as 
described previously (Linet al., 1988) or by two-dimensional PAGE as de- 
scribed previously (Goldstein et al., 1985).

Figure L Proteolysis of fimbrin produces two fragments, fimbrin 
core (58 kD) and headpiece (10 kD). With longer times of diges- 
tion, fimbrin core remains stable but headpiece is degraded into 
smaller fragments. Numbers on the left indicate the positions of the 
molecular weight standards. 
Results 
Fimbrin Proteolysis 
In nondenaturing conditions small amounts of papain (Fig. 
1), trypsin, thermolysin, proteinase K, subtilisin, or V-8 pro- 
tease (not shown) cleaved intact fimbrin with the simulta- 
neous appearance of two fragments, termed core and head- 
piece (58 and 10 kD). With longer times of digestion, the 
fimbrin headpiece but not core was cleaved to smaller frag- 
ments. Neither intact fimbrin nor fimbrin headpiece polypep- 
tides could be sequenced, suggesting that the amino terminus 
of each was blocked and that fimbrin headpiece corresponded 
to the amino-terminal fragment of fimbrin. The amino ter- 
minus of fimbrin core was sequenced (see Fig. 4). The pres- 
ence of a sequenceable amino terminus, size, and time 
course of appearance during proteolysis suggested the core 
fragment was derived from the carboxy-terminal part of 
fimbrin. 
l~mbrin cDNA and Protein Sequence 
A fimbrin-specific antiserum identified a single cDNA clone 
(SW6) in a hgtl 1 library (Fig. 2). This clone (2.4 kb) hybrid- 
ized with a 3.2-kb band in Northern blots of chicken intestine 
RNA (Fig. 3). The sequence of SW6 contained an open read- 
ing frame encoding a 498-amino acid polypeptide. Two 
other clones (M38, 2.3 kb; M48, 3.7 kb, Fig. 2), isolated 
from the Xgtl0 library by screening with SW6 as a probe, 
contained a 1.9-kb open reading frame encoding a 630- 
amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 
70,894 (Fig. 4). The coding regions of all three clones were 
identifical. One clone (M48) lacked a poly(A) tail and con- 
tained additional sequences in the 5' untranslated region (90 
bp) and in the coding region (830 bp) that were not in M38 
or SW6. The 830 bp sequence lies in the codon for cys165 
between nucleotides 496 and 497. Because there are splice- 
junction sequences at the borders of the additional sequences, 
this clone probably represents an incompletely processed 
transcript. The amino terminus of the polypeptide was as- 
signed based on the calculated molecular weight of the en- 
coded protein and the absence of other initiation codons in 
the region. Fimbrin headpiece corresponded to residues 
1-114 and fimbrin core to residues 115-630. 
Duplicated Domains in Fimbrin and Plastin 
A search of sequence data bases (GenBank and NBRF) 
showed that fimbrin is the chicken homologue of human 
T- and L-plastin. L- and T-plastin were cloned from a human 
fibroblast library (Lin et al., 1988), and encode 630 and 627 
amino acid proteins respectively. The sequences of both iso- 
forms have been recently amended (Lin et al., 1990) to in- 
clude the correct amino termini. Fimbrin was slightly more 
homologous with T-plastin (72.1% identity in 627 residues) 
Figure 3. A Northern blot of total 
chicken intestine RNA was probed 
with an 0.3-kb fragment from 
clone M3g. A single band of 3.2 
kb is detected.

than with L-plastin (69.9% identity in 627 residues). Chicken 
intestinal epithelial cells probably contain a single fimbrin 
isoform because two-dimensional gels of isolated brush bor- 
ders indicate a single fimbrin spot (Glenney et al., 1981b) and 
cDNA probes to fimbrin detected a single band on Northern 
blots of chicken intestinal cell RNA (Fig. 3). This fnding is 
consistent with our observation that various human noncan- 
cer cells express a single plastin isoform distinguishable on 
Northern blots by a characteristic size for each isoform 
mRNA. 
Matrix comparisons of fimbrin and plastin polypeptide se- 
quences (Fig. 5) display four diagonal lines, indicating four 
homologous regions referred to as A, B, A', and B'. These 
regions can be paired in two groups in which regions A and 
B (residues 100-350) comprise the amino-terminal half of 
fimbrin core and regions g and B' (residues 350-630) com- 
prise the carboxy-terminal half. More detailed analysis (Ta- 
ble I) shows that the AB regions of fimbrin and plastin are 
the most highly homologous (76-78% identical); their/(B' 
regions are also highly homologous (72-75 % identical), but 
region AB is only weakly homologous with region ,~/B' 
(19-25 % identical). A pairwise comparison of all A, ,g, B, 
and B' regions (Table II) shows that the A regions are more 
similar to ~ regions than to B or B' regions. The percent 
identities between the regions are low (15-28%); however, 
each region contains a common pattern of conserved resi- 
dues (boxed) within a 90-residue sequence (Fig. 6). This se- 
quence is bounded by a conserved trp-x-asn sequence at the

Fimbrin 
Figure 5. Matrix comparison between chicken fimbrin and human 
T-plastin shows a continuous diagnonal throughout their sequence. 
In addition, there arc four off-diagonal lines that indicate internal 
regions of homology. The diagram above the matrix shows the posi- 
tions of fimbrin headpiece and core domains and the positions of 
the repeated homologous sequences. (A, B, P~, and B'). The se-

amino terminus and by a asp-ile/leu/val-val-x-x-pro sequence 
at the carboxy terminus. Most of the conserved residues are 
hydrophobic. 
Homologies with Actin Gelation Proteins 
The AB regions of fimbrin are homologous with the amino- 
terminal domains of chicken (Lemaire et al., 1988) and hu- 
man (Koenig et al., 1988) dystrophin (18.7 and 19.8% identi- 
cal) and chicken alpha-actinin (Baron et al., 1987) 17.6% 
identical) (Fig. 9 and Table I). Mimura and Asano (1986) 
demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain of alpha- 
actinin binds actin filaments. Other recent reports have 
shown that the actin-binding domain of alpha-actinin is ho- 
mologous with the amino-terminal domains of Drosophila 
beta-spectrin (Byers et al., 1989) and Dictyostelium actin 
gelatin protein (Noegel et al., 1989). These domains were 
20.7 and 17.2% identical with the AB region of fimbrin. 
The amino-terminal domains of the actin gelation proteins 
also displayed the AB organization that we detected in 
fimbrin and plasfin. Most of the boxed areas in Fig. 6 indi- 
cate the residues conserved not only between fimbrin and 
plastin but also with the amino terminal domains of dystro- 
phin and homologues. Other conserved areas, marked by the 
consensus sequence, are unique for the A and ~¢ domains or 
the B and B' domains. The consensus sequences shared by 
the A and B domains are primarily hydrophobic residues, 
clustered in two groups and separated by charged residues. 
The duplicated sequence within the amino-terminal domains 
of the actin gelation protein sequences have not been previ- 
ously reported.

Calmodulin-like Calcium-binding Sites 
The sequence of fimbrin headpiece shows no similarity to 
fimbrin core or to villin headpiece. A database search re- 
vealed that fimbrin headpiece is homologous with vertebrate 
calmodulin (Simmen et al., 1985) (34.7% identity) and a 
pseudogene (Stein et al., 1983) for skeletal muscle calmodu- 
lin (37.5 % identity). Although not expressed in muscle, the 
pseudogene sequence encodes a fully functional calmodulin, 
demonstrated by binding studies on protein expressed in bac- 
teria (Putkey et al., 1985). Matrix comparisons between 
headpiece and calmodulin (not shown) indicated that two 
regions in headpiece are homologous to calcium-binding 
sites of calmodulin. Previous sequence analysis of plastin 
had described a single calcium binding site (Lin et al., 1990). 
Both of the identified regions in headpiece contained a con- 
sensus calcium-binding site flanked by predicted alpha- 
helix, forming a pair of EF hand or helix-loop-helix motifs 
(Fig. 7). In the three-dimensional structure of calmodulin, 
the calcium-binding domains I and II and domains HI and 
IV of calmodulin are at opposite ends of a central alpha-heli- 
cal linker region (reviewed by Strynadka and James, 1989). 
Fimbrin headpiece is more similar to calmodulin domains 
III and IV (37.5% identity) than to domains I and II (23% 
identity). Both sites in fimbrin headpiece are predicted to

Fimbrin/Plastin Homology Demonstrated by Antibody 
Cross-Reactivity 
Isoforms of plastin, identified by their positions on two- 
dimensional gels, have been detected in a variety of human 
and mouse cells (Goldstein et al., 1985). Fimbrin has also 
been detected (using immunofluorescence) in a variety of 
cell types from different species (Bretscher and Weber, 1980). 
Fig. 8 a shows in an autoradiogram of [~sS]methionine- 
labeled proteins of the human squamous cell carcinoma cell 
line SCC separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. 
L-plastin focused at a characteristic position (pI 5.9, 68 kD). 
When a blot of the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 8 b) was re- 
acted with anti-fimbrin serum, L-plastin, and phospho-L- 
plastin were detected. T-plastin is less abundant in these cells 
and could not be detected on the two-dimensional gel or the

ies. A two-dimensional gel of 
[35S]methionine-labeled 
pro- 
teins from SCC ceUs (a), shows 
the position of L-plastin (large 
arrowhead) and a ubiquitous 
70-kD polypeptide used as a 
marker to identify the posi- 
tions of L- and T-plastin. The 
acidic portion of the gel is on 
left. The corresponding immu- 
noblot (b) shows that L-plastin 
and its more acidic phosporyl- 
ated derivative is detected by 
the fimbrin antiserum. The 
SDS-PAGE gel (c) of bacterial 
cultures transformed with ex-

4) before induction (lanes 2 
and 4) and after 1.8 h induc- 
tion (lanes 1 and 3) with 0.4 
mM IPTG. The correspond- 
ing immunoblot (d) shows the 
fimbrin antiserum detects bac- 
terially expressed T-plastin 
(lane 1) and L-plastin (lane 3) 
in the induced but not in unin- 
duced (lanes 2 and 4) bacte- 
ria. Molecular weight mark- 
ers are in the flanking lanes.

immunoblot. To show that our polyclonal antisera could de- 
tect T-plastin, we tested for cross-reactivity with recombinant 
T- and L-plastin (Fig. 8 c) on immunoblots. The fimbrin an- 
tisera crossreacted with recombinant L- and T-plastin poly- 
peptides (Fig. 8 d) that were expressed in bacteria after in- 
duction with IPTG. Control lanes showed no crossreactivity 
with bacterial proteins. 
Isoform-specific Expression 
The presence of two fimbrin isoforms in mammalian cells 
may signify functional differences in actin-binding or cyto- 
skeletal organization. To determine whether plastin isoform 
expression is restricted to particular cells, we surveyed a 
variety of human cell types (Table HI) for expression of 
L- and T-plastin isoforms using Northern blot analysis or 
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In normal cell strains 
assayed, expression of L-plastin was restricted to replicating 
populations of hematopoietic cells: erythrocytes and plate- 
lets exhibited no detectable L-plastin (data not shown). Cell 
strains derived from normal solid tissues expressed only 
T-plastin. 
Expression of the plastin isoforms in human cancer cells 
was studied using the same assays. Like their normal coun- 
terparts, T- and B-lymphoblastoid and myeloid cell lines ex- 
pressed only L-plastin. However, in contrast with our find- 
ings for normal cells from solid tissues, 16 out of 22 cell lines 
derived from solid tumors or tumor-derived secondary cul- 
tures (not established as stable cell lines) expressed L-plastin 
in addition to T-plastin. In most cases, the L-plastin levels 
were several-fold higher than T-plastin although expression 
of L-plastin in individual tumor-derived cell lines varied 
greatly (data not shown) compared with the more constant 
level of T-plastin expression (Lin et al., 1988). The retino- 
blastoma cell line Y79, an anchorage-independent cell line, 
was the only human cell line tested that did not synthesize 
detectable levels of plastin messenger RNA or polypeptide 
(Lin et al., 1988). 
Discussion 
Our results provide the first evidence that links two classes 
of actin-binding proteins, actin bundling proteins and actin 
gelation factors, into a structurally related family of actin 
cross-linking proteins. A striking feature of these proteins is 
their modular organization (Fig. 9). A simple model of fim- 
brin depicts an amino-terminal calcium-binding domain and 
tandem arrangement of actin binding domains, AB and gB'. 
Each actin-binding domain consists of a duplicated sequence, 
suggesting that fimbrin structure arose from two gene dupli- 
cation events. The first duplication resulted in the A and B 
domains; a second duplication produced the ?¢ and B' do- 
mains. ,The close spacing of actin filaments in a fimbrin bun- 
dle might result from the tandem arrangement of closely sep- 
arated actin-binding domains. 
Different arrangements of a single actin-binding domain 
(Fig. 9) can account for the variety of actin gels and bundles 
present in a cell. The actin gelation proteins generally con- 
sist of an actin-binding domain, a rod-like spacer domain, 
and a carboxy-terminal domain responsible for binding cal- 
cium, membranes, or other actin-binding proteins. Alpha- 
actinin for example, contains a single actin-binding domain 
per monomer, but when oligomerized into an antiparallel 
dimer the two actin-binding sites lie at opposite ends of the 
molecule. Proteins in which actin-binding domains are spaced 
increasingly apart from each other retain crosslinking activ- 
ity but bundle actin filaments more loosely (Brotschi et al., 
1978; Condeelis et al., 1984). The flexibility of a protein, 
increasing with length of the molecule, could allow the cross- 
linking of orthogonally arranged filaments into a three-di- 
mensional meshwork. 
Role of Calcium in Actin Bundle Formation 
Fimbrin is composed of two structural domains (Fig. 9), 
headpiece and core, linked by a protease-sensitive region. 
Sequence homologies with other actin- or calcium-binding 
proteins suggest that these domains have separate functional 
roles: headpiece binds calcium and core binds actin. By equi-

librium dialysis, Glenncy and collaborators (1981) identified 
in fimbrin a single calcium-binding site that is competed by 
Mg :+. This site is probably one of the sites predicted in tim- 
brin headpiece; whether a second calcium-binding site in 
headpiece also binds calcium is not known. The functional 
role of calcium in fimbrin regulation is not understood be- 
cause preliminary evidence (Glenney et al., 1981b; Matsu- 
daira, E, manuscript in preparation) suggests that fimbrin 
binding to actin is independent of calcium. The homology 
between fimbrin and plastin is weakest in the headpiece do- 
main raising the possibility that the isoforms may be differen- 
tially regulated by calcium. Alpha-actinin, which has actin- 
and calcium-binding domains (Noegel et al., 1987) similar 
to fimbrin, is inhibited by calcium from crosslinking actin 
filaments. Chemical cross-linking studies demonstrate that 
the calcium-binding domain interacts with the actin-binding 
domain (Imamura et al., 1988). Although fimbrin headpiece 
is more closely related to calmodulin (34.7% identify) than 
the calcium-binding domains of alpha-actinin (18.4% iden- 
tity), a similar interaction of headpiece with core may influ- 
ence actin-binding activity in a different fimbrin isoform. 
The calcium-binding headpiece domains of fimbrin and 
villin are not homologous despite their similar sizes. In villin 
this domain binds calcium (Hesterherg et al., 1985) and lies 
at the carboxy terminus (Glenney et al., 1981b). The isolated 
villin headpiece domain binds but does not bundle actin fila- 
ments and binding is not affected by calcium. We do not 
know if fimbrin headpiece contains an actin-binding activity. 
Do Conserved Sequences Represent 
Actin-binding Sites? 
The presence of a consensus sequence in various actin bind- 
ing proteins is often interpreted to indicate conservation of 
an actin-binding site, given the evolutionary conservation of 
actin (Blanchard et al., 1989). An alternative interpretation 
of a conserved sequence in actin-binding proteins is sug- 
gested by the fact that the most variable region of the actin 
sequence is at the acidic amino terminus, where basic 
residues in several actin-binding proteins can be chemically 
crosslinked (Sutoh and Mabuchi, 1986). The consensus se- 
quence in the A and B domains of fimbrin and the larger actin 
binding proteins is largely hydrophobic and thus is likely to 
be buried in the protein, an unlikely location for an actin- 
binding site. 
A possible function for the conserved hydrophobic se- 
quence is suggested from studies on villin and other actin- 
severing proteins with a conserved hydrophobic repeated se- 
quence. We have concluded that these sequences might be 
involved in maintaining a conformation or structure of the 
domains (Matsudaira and Janmey, 1988): the consensus se- 
quence maps within protease-resistant regions of villin, and 
amino acids such as cysteine (Matsudaira et al., 1985) or me- 
thionine (unpublished data) within the conserved repeat can- 
not be chemically modified in the folded, native protein. 
These experiments directly support the prediction that con- 
served sequences in villin are buried in the protein. Although 
we have not mapped the residues that are accessible to sol- 
vent and the protease-resistant domains of fimbrin to the 
same resolution as viUin, we suggest the conserved se- 
quences in fimbrin may possibly play a similar structural 
role. 
Possible Regulation of Actin Binding 
by Phosphorylation 
The identification of fimbrin as plastin suggests that the 
actin- and/or calcium-binding activity of fimbrin may be 
modulated by phosphorylation. Two other actin bundling 
proteins, band 4.9 of the erythrocyte membrane (Husain- 
Chistri et al., 1988) and synapsin I of the nerve synapse 
(Bahler et al., 1986), also become phosphorylated. In both 
cases, phosphorylation inhibits actin bundle formation. L-plas- 
tin was first identified on the basis of its exclusive expression 
in transformed cells and was later detected in normal lym- 
phocytes and macrophages. L-plastin becomes phosphory- 
lated, presumably by protein kinase C, on unidentified serine 
residues when leukemia cells are activated by PMA or when 
leukocytes are activated by IL 1 (Goldstein et al., 1985; An- 
derson et al., 1985; Matsushima et al., 1988). The level of 
phosphorylation varies between cell types, but can approach 
as much as 30% of the total soluble L-plastin (Leavitt, J., 
unpublished data). Unlike L-plastin, T-plastin phosphoryla- 
tion has not been detected in any cell line and thus T-plastin 
might not he a substrate for kinases. Fimbrin purified from 
chicken intestine epithelia is a single spot on a two-dimen- 
sional gel and phosphorylated intestinal fimbrin has not been 
detected. 
Functional Differences between Fimbrin lsoforms 
In addition to differences in sequence and phosphorylation, 
the differential expression of the L- and T-isoforms in hema- 
topoietic and non-hematopoietic cells and the change in iso- 
form expression in neoplastic cells suggest the isoforms are 
functionally different. This differential expression was not

detected in immunofluorescence studies of various cells 
(Bretscher and Weber, 1980a) because polyclonal antisera 
raised against chicken fimbrin cannot distinguish the two hu- 
man fimbrin/plastin isoforms (Fig. 8 d). The pattern of iso- 
form expression may be correlated with the motile or adhe- 
sive properties of the cell because antibodies specific for 
fimbrin have detected fimbrin in focal contacts and adhesion 
sites on the ventral surface of cultured ceils, monocytes, and 
macrophages (Bretscher and Weber, 1980b; Carley et al., 
1985). Recent identification of protein kinase C at sites of 
focal contact Oaken et al., 1989) and our finding that fimbrin 
is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein in leucocytes raise the tan- 
talizing possibility that fimbrin phosphorylation is involved 
in cell-substratum or cell-cell interactions. Changes in ex- 
pression and distribution of microfilament proteins often ac- 
company neoplastic transformation in many cell systems. 
The discovery of phosphorylated isoforms of fimbrin pro- 
vides additional molecular details of the possible mechanism 
of regulation of cellular actin bundles during the re-organiza- 
tion of the microfilament-based cytoskeleton.

Abstract. Although numerous hair proteins have been 
studied biochemically and many have been sequenced, 
relatively little is known about their in situ distribution 
and differential expression in the hair follicle. To study 
this problem, we have prepared several mouse mono- 
clonal antibodies that recognize different classes of 
human hair proteins. Our AE14 antibody recognizes a 
group of 10-25K hair proteins which most likely cor- 
responds to the high sulfur proteins, our AE12 and 
AE13 antibodies define a doublet of 44K/46K proteins 
which are relatively acidic and correspond to the type 
I low sulfur keratins, and our previously described 
AE3 antibody recognizes a triplet of 56K/59K/60K 
proteins which are relatively basic and correspond to 
the type II low sulfur keratins. Using these and other 
immunological probes, we demonstrate the following. 
(a) The acidic 44K/46K and basic 56-60K hair kera- 
tins appear coordinately in upper corticle and cuticle 
cells. (b) The 10-25K, AE14-reactive antigens are ex- 
pressed only later in more matured corticle cells that 
are in the upper elongation zone, but these antigens 
are absent from cuticle cells. (c) The 10-nm filaments 
of the inner root sheath cells fail to react with any of 
our monoclonal antibodies and are therefore immuno- 
logically distinguishable from the cortex and cuticle 
filaments. (d) Nail plate contains 10-20% soft keratins 
in addition to large amounts of hair keratins; these soft 
keratins have been identified as the 50K/58K and 
48K/56K keratin pairs. Taken together, these results 
suggest that the precursor cells of hair cortex and nail 
plate share a major pathway of epithelial differentia- 
tion, and that the acidic 44K/46K and basic 56-60K 
hard keratins represent a co-expressed keratin pair 
which can serve as a marker for hair/nail-type epithe- 
lial differentiation. 
H 
AIR originates from a follicular structure which con- 
sists of three parts: an outer root sheath, an inner 
root sheath that includes Henle s and Huxley's layers 
and the inner root sheath cuticle, and the hair fiber itself that 
includes the hair cuticle, cortex, and medulla (Montagna and 
Parakkal, 1974; Swift, 1977). The emerged hair fiber is com- 
posed primarily of cortical cells filled with 10-nm keratin 
filaments. Biochemical studies of wool filaments and their 
associated matrix material have led to the realization that 
there are three major classes of hair proteins: the ""low sulfur 
keratins"" (designated 40-60K), the ""high-sulfur proteins"" 
(10-25K), and the ""high glycine/tyrosine proteins"" (6-9K). 
It is believed that the low sulfur keratins form the 10-nm 
filaments and the latter two groups of proteins form in- 
terfilamentous matrix. More detailed analyses have shown 
that each of these three classes of hair protein can be further 
divided into subclasses (Fraser et al., 1972; Crewther, 1976; 
Gillespie, 1983; Rogers, 1984). The low sulfur keratins of 
wool have been resolved into multiple components (Nos. 5, 
7, and 8) which fall into two subfamilies (type I and type II) 
according to their amino acid sequence homology to the two 
prototypic wool keratin fragments isolated and sequenced by 
Crewther and co-workers (Crewther, 1976; Crewther et al., 
1976, 1978, 1980; Gough et al., 1978). The high sulfur pro- 
teins of wool can be resolved into 60-70 minor components, 
which can be grouped into at least three major subfamilies 
with molecular weights of 11,000, 16,000, and 19,000 (Crew- 
ther, 1976; Swart et al., 1976; Lindley, 1977; Powell et al., 
1983). Finally, the high glycine/tyrosine proteins, of which 
over 20 have been identified so far, can be divided into one 
group of proteins which are poor in cystine but rich in 
phenylalanine, and another group for which the reverse is 
true (Zahn et al., 1980; Gillespie, 1983; Rogers, 1984). 
The low sulfur keratins of hair and nail (""hard"" keratins) z 
1. In this paper, we use the terms ""hard ~ and ""soft"" keratins, in a classical 
sense, to describe the alpha-keratins of the hardened, comified tissues (e.g., 
hair and nail) and those of the ""soft; mucosa-type epithelia, respectively 
(Fraser and Macrae, 1980).

and the keratin intermediate filament of various ""soft' epithe- 
lia including the epidermis are clearly related because (a) 
they share a similar x-ray diffraction pattern arising from 
alpha-helices in a coiled-coil conformation (Fraser et al., 
1972; Baden et al., 1973); (b) all soft keratins can be divided 
by hybrid selection and immunological criteria into a ba- 
sic and an acidic subfamily corresponding to the type I and 
type II wool low sulfur keratins, respectively (Fuchs et al., 
1981; Schiller et al., 1982; Tseng et al., 1982; Hanukoglu 
and Fuchs, 1983; Kim et al., 1983; Eichner et al., 1984; 
Sun et al., 1984, 1985; Quinlan et al., 1985); (c) an antise- 
rum prepared against wool merokeratin (the protease- 
resistant, alpha-helical domain of wool keratins) cross-reacts 
strongly with keratin fibers of PtK2 and HeLa cells, as well 
as several mucosal epithelia (Weber et al., 1980); and (d) 
amino acid sequences of hard and epidermal keratins show 
extensive homology (Hanukoglu and Fuchs, 1982; Weber 
and Geisler, 1982, 1984). 
On the other hand, data are also available pointing to some 
unique features of hard as compared with soft keratins. 
Firstly, Baden and co-workers (Lee et al., 1976; Baden et al., 
1980) have reported that their antisera prepared against hu- 
man hair keratins react strongly with hair and nail keratins 
but fail to react with epidermal (soft) keratins. Secondly, 
hard keratins, at least those of wool and human hair, are al- 
most totally insoluble under conditions that solubilize soft 
keratins (e.g., 8-9 M urea, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol in 10-25 
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; O'Donnell and Thompson, 1964; 
Crewther, 1976). This insolubility of hard keratins had led to 
the common practice of solubilizing the proteins either by 
proteolytic digestion or by S-carboxymethylation after re- 
duction in alkaline conditions (Crewther, 1976). Unfortu- 
nately, such covalent modifications have made it difficult to 
compare the biochemical and immunological properties of 
hard and soft keratins since the latter have been characterized 
without such modifications. 
This tremendous heterogeneity in hair proteins, coupled 
with the complex histological features of the hair follicle, 
constituted a major obstacle to discerning the in situ distribu- 
tion and function of hair proteins. Hence, despite the fact that 
over 25 wool proteins have been completely sequenced, rel- 
atively little is known concerning their association with 
specific hair structures or their differential expression during 
hair differentiation (reviewed in Gillespie, 1983; Rogers, 
1984, 1985; Powell and Rogers, 1986). 
In this paper, we describe the characterization of human 
hair and nail keratins (in an unmodified or ""-SH form"") by 
one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by 
immunoblotting using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. 
Three of these monoclonal antibodies (AE12, AE13, and 
AE14) have been raised against human hair fiber proteins and 
are described for the first time here. Our results have estab- 
lished that hair and nail share a relatively basic, AE3- 
reactive, 56K/59K/60K (type II) keratin triplet and a rela- 
tively acidic, AEI2- and AE13-reactive, 44K/46K (type I) 
keratin doublet. Immunolocalization data indicate that these 
basic and acidic keratins appear coordinately in upper corti- 
cal and cuticle cells of the hair follicle. Moreover, since hu- 
Figure 1. One-dimensional 
immunoblot analyses of hu- 
man hair and nail keratins 
using alF antibody as well as 
monoclonal antibodies raised 
against ""soft"" keratins. Kera- 
tins were extracted 
from 
(lanes 1 and 5) human ab- 
dominal epidermis, (lanes 2 
and 6) human hair, (lane 3) 
human nail plate (dorsal part 
only), (lane 4) cultured hu- 
man newborn foreskin epider- 
mal cells, and (lane 7) wool. 
The proteins were resolved by 
SDS PAGE on 12.5% gels, 
transferred electrophoretical- 
ly to nitrocellulose, and stained 
with (a) Fast green, (b) aIF 
monoclonal antibody that rec- 
ognizes all basic keratins 
strongly, and most acidic ker- 
atins weakly (Cooper et al., 
1984), (c) same as in b but 
with a greater amount of sam- 
ples loaded to show the weak 
immunoreactivities 
of the 
acidic keratins, (d) AE1, which recognizes many acidic (type I) keratins (Sun et al., 1984), (e) AE2, which recognizes the 56.5K and 
65-67K markers for ""skin-type"" differentiation (Tseng et al., 1982; Woodcock-MitcheU et al., 1982; Cooper et al., 1985), and (f) AE3, 
which defines all known basic (type II) ""soft"" keratins (Sun et al., 1984). Note the overall similarities among hair, nail, and wool keratins, 
with the exception that nail contains AEl-positive 48K, 50K, and two high molecular weight bands (marked by circles in Fig. 1 d). Also 
note that the three largest hair keratins are AE3 positive. The AE3-positive 54K band in lanes 2 and 3 of f is probably due to stratum 
corneum contamination (from some chemical reagents) which was not detected in most of our other experiments (cf., lane 6 in the same 
panel; also see Figs. 3 c and 5 c; Ochs, 1983; Cooper et al., 1985). 
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 103, 1986

man soft keratins have been well characterized (unlike those 
of the sheep), by concentrating on human hair and nail kera- 
tins we were able to compare several important aspects of 
soft and hard keratin expression. Such a comparison has al- 
lowed us to integrate the available information on these two 
types of keratins, and to conclude that the acidic and basic 
hard keratins may be regarded as another coexpressed pair 
(Sun et al., 1984; Cooper et al., 1985) that represents a 
marker for ""hair/nail-type"" of epithelial differentiation. 
Materials and Methods 
Keratin Extraction 
Human hair clippings were minced to <2-3 mm in length, incubated under 
nitrogen in 8 M urea, 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) and 200 mM 2-mercapto- 
ethanol for 2 h, at which time the physically swollen hair was homogenized 
with a Polytron for 30 s, and the incubation was continued under nitrogen 
for an additional 2 h (O'Donnell and Thompson, 1964; Baden et al., 1973; 
Steinert and Rogers, 1973). Insoluble material was removed by centrifuga- 
tion at 10,000 g for 10 rain, and the supernatant was stored at -70°C in small 
aliquots until use. Hairs clipped from various points along mature hair 
shafts of three normal individuals have been used, yielding similar results. 
Distal clippings of normal human nail plates were scraped to remove the 
ventral 1/4 portion in order to be certain that the specimen was free of con- 
tamination by epidermal stratum corneum which tends to accumulate under 
the nail. The nail clippings were subsequently filed into a fine powder and 
extracted by the same procedure as the hair. Similar results were obtained 
from samples derived from three individuals. 
Keratins were extracted from fresh human epidermis and from cultured 
newborn human foreskin epidermal cells using 8 M urea, 25 mM Tris-HC1 
(pH 7.4), and 25 mM DDT as described previously (Woodcock-Mitchell et 
al., 1982). 
To minimize proteolysis, all solutions contain a mixture of protease in- 
hibitors as described (Woodcock-Mitcbell et al., 1982). 
Antibodies 
The preparation and characterization of mouse monoclonal antibodies AE1, 
AE2, and AE3 have been described (Woodcock-Mitchell et al., 1982). The 
mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-intermediate filament [alF]) recognizing 
a determinant common to all types of intermediate filaments (Pruss et al., 
1981) is a gift from Dr. Rebecca Pruss of the National Institutes of Health. 
A polyclonal rabbit anti-laminin serum is a gift from Drs. Hinda Kleinman 
and George Martin of NIH (Timpl et al., 1979). 
The AEI2, AE13, and AEI4 antibodies were prepared as follows: human 
hair keratins in 8 M urea were dialyzed against 0.1% SDS, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 
pH 7.4, and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, emulsified with either complete 
(for primary immunization) or incomplete (for boosting) Freund's adjuvant, 
and injected subcutaneously into multiple sites in female BALB/c mice (200 
~tg protein per mouse). Spleen cells from these mice were fused with P3X63 
Ag. 8.653 myeloma cells (kindly provided by Dr. M. Scharffof Albert Ein- 
stein Medical College) using 50% polyethylene glycol 1450 (Merck) ac- 
cording to Kohler and Milstein (1975). Hybridoma cells were grown in the 
presence of macrophage feeder cells, selected with hypoxanthine/aminopte- 
rin/thymidine (HAT) medium, and assayed for anti-keratin activities by 
ELISA (Woodcock-Mitchell et al., 1982). Colonies selectively reacting 
with hair proteins (but not with epidermal keratins) were cloned three times 
by limiting dilution (for some strategies useful in preparing monoclonal an- 
tibodies specific for individual keratins, see Cooper et al., 1985). 
Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting 
One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoreses (both IEF and NEPHGE) 
were performed according to Laemmli (1970) and O'Farrell et al. (1975; 
1977), respectively. Immunoblotting was done according to Towbin et al. 
(1979) with some modifications that facilitate the identification of individual 
keratins by recording photographically both the fast green and the peroxi- 
dase antiperoxidase immunoreaction staining patterns of the same blot 
(Woodcock-Mitchell et al., 1982; Eichner et al., 1984). 
Immunofluorescence Staining 
Frozen sections of human scalp (6 ~tm) were stained by indirect im- 
munofluorescence as described previously (Sun and Green, 1978b; Sun et 
al., 1979).

The numbering of keratin samples is the same as in Fig. 1. The sample in e contains human hair keratins analyzed on a 20% (instead 
of the usual 11.5%) polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with (a) Fast Green, (b) AE12, (c) AE13, and (d and e) AE14. Note that both 
AEI2 and AE13 recognize the 44K and 46K hair keratins. AEI3 does not seem to cross-react with any ""soft"" keratins, while AE12 shows 
weak cross-reaction with the 56.5K/65-67K keratins. Also note that AEI4 reacts with 10-25K material (marked with brackets in d) in 
hair, and a 58K (No. 5) keratin (arrow) in epidermis.

raining a reducing agent is much more efficient at pH 9.5 than 
at neutral pH routinely used for the extraction of soft kera- 
tins. There are two possible explanations for the influence of 
pH: (a) disulfide bonds, which are much more abundant in 
hard keratins than in soft ones, are reduced more efficiently 
under alkaline conditions; and (b) high pH may induce par- 
tial unfolding of the otherwise compact keratin structure, 
making the disulfide bonds more easily accessible to reduc- 
ing agents. 
One-dimensional SDS PAGE showed that among the hu- 
man hair keratins solubilized under our conditions we can 
resolve five major bands: a triplet of 56,000, 59,000, and 
60,000, designated 56K/59K/60K, and a doublet of 44,000 
and 46,000, designated 44K/46K (Fig. 1 a, lane 2; Fig. 2 a, 
lane 6). Two-dimensional PAGE showed that the 56K/59K/ 
60K components are relatively basic (pI 6.4-6.7) and the 
44K/46K components are relatively acidic (pI <5; Fig. 3). 
Since most of the hair keratins (except the 60K component) 
have a pI of <6.5, better resolution can be obtained for these 
proteins using the IEF-SDS gel system which was, therefore, 
used in most of our subsequent analyses. 
Electrophoretic and immunoblotting data showed that the 
triplet and the doublet belong to two distinct classes: the rela- 
tively basic 56K, 59K, and 60K components react strongly 
with the alF antibody (Fig. 1 b, lane 2, and Fig. 4 b). This 
is consistent with our previous finding that the alF antibody 
reacts preferentially with the larger keratins that belong to 
the basic subfamily (Cooper et al., 1984). In addition, these 
hair keratins react strongly with our AE3 antibody which 
recognizes all known soft keratins of the basic, type II sub- 
family (Fig. If, lanes 2 and 6; Fig. 4 c; see Sun et al., 1984; 
Cooper et al., 1985). Taken together, these results suggest 
that the human 56K/59K/60K triplet corresponds to the low 
sulfur wool keratins Nos. 5 and 7c (reported molecular 
weights of 55,000-58,000; Woods, 1979), and belong to the 
basic, type II keratin subfamily (Crewther, 1976, 1980; also 
see below). 
The acidic 44K and the 46K components react, although 
only weakly, with the alF antibody which has been shown 
previously to recognize all intermediate filament proteins in- 
cluding all soft keratins (Fig. 1 c, lane 2; for two-dimensional 
immunoblot, see Figs. 4, a and b; Pruss et al., 1980; Cooper 
et al., 1984), thus confirming their homology with inter- 
mediate filament proteins. These two components do not re- 
act with our AE1 antibody which recognizes many soft kera- 
tins of the acidic subfamily (Fig. 1 d, lanes 2 and 6; see Tseng 
et al., 1982; Sun et al., 1984; Cooper et al., 1985). However, 
these two proteins react strongly with two of our new 
monoclonal antibodies raised against human hair keratins 
(for results obtained with AE12 antibody see Fig. 2 b, lanes 
2 and 6; for AE13 results, see Fig. 2 c, lanes 2 and 6). The 
fact that AE13 did not cross-react with any soft keratins (Fig. 
2 c and data not shown) suggests that these acidic 44K/46K 
hair keratins possess unique epitopes. The relative charge 
and size (and the corresponding two-dimensional gel mobil- 
ity) of the 44K/46K hair proteins strongly suggest that they 
correspond to the previously characterized low sulfur sheep 
wool keratin No. 8 (reported molecular weight of 45,000- 
50,000; O'Donnell and Thompson, 1964; Woods, 1979), and 
belong to the acidic, type I keratin subfamily (Crewther, 
1976, 1980). 
In addition to these five major intermediate filament-

nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis and second dimen-

green, and then with (b) a mixture of AE3 (which recognizes the 
56K/59K/60k keratins) and AEI3 (44K/46K) monoclonal anti-ker- 
atin antibodies. Note the resolution of hair keratins into two distinct 
groups. For a comparison of the one- and two-dimensional gel pat- 
terns, the sample was also applied to a side lane (on the right,

related proteins, human hair contains a small amount of low 
molecular weight material which, although barely detectable 
by Fast Green or Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1 a, lanes 2 and 6; 
and Fig. 2 a, lane 6), can be visualized readily with another 
new monoclonal antibody, AE14, as a 10-25K smear (Fig. 
2 d, bracketed zones in lanes 2 and 6). This AE14-reactive 
material appears as a much better defined ""band"" when the 
acrylamide concentration of the gel is increased from 12.5 % 
to 20% (Fig. 2 e). It is present in all hard keratin preparations 
that we have examined so far including human nails (Fig. 2 
d, lane 3) and sheep wool (Fig. 2 d, lane 7; also see below), 
but is not detectable in the epidermis (Fig. 2 d, lanes 1 and 
5). The size range and species distribution of this material 
suggest that it may correspond to at least some of the so- 
called high sulfur proteins. The high glycine/tyrosine pro- 
teins are much smaller in size (6-9K) and are reported to 
be absent from human hair (Fraser and MacRae, 1982; 
Gillespie, 1983; Marshall, 1983). 
Human Nail Keratins 
To compare the keratins of the hair with those of another 
hard tissue, we analyzed keratins of human nail plate. Con-

sistent with previous studies (Baden et al., 1973; Marshall, 
1983), we found that the major nail polypeptides (Fig. 1 a, 
lane 3) are similar to those of the hair (Fig. 1 a, lanes 2 and 
6) both in electrophoretic mobility and in immunoreactivity 
with various monoclonal anti-keratin antibodies (Figs. 1, 2, 
and 5). 
We also found that nail plate contains a small but sig- 
nificant amount (10-20 % as estimated by Fast green staining; 
Figs. 1 a and 5 a) of soft keratins that we have identified as 
the 48K, 50K, 56K, and 58K keratins (for the tissue distribu- 
tion and immunological properties of the soft keratins, see 
Moll et al., 1982; Sun et al., 1984). Figs. 1 d (lane 3) and 
5 d show the immunological detection of the acidic 50K and 
48K keratins in nail by AE1 blotting. The identity of these 
two keratins was confirmed by mixing keratin preparations

of keratins from nail and cultured human epidermal cells. Note in 
fthat the minor nail components (labeled N50 and N48 in a) co- 
migrate with the 50K and 48K soft keratins of cultured human 
epidermal keratinocytes.

and second dimensional SDS PAGE, respectively. Basic proteins

as compared to the NEPHGE SDS gel system (Fig. 3), and the ab-

mal cells. BSA (labeled B in panel a) was added as a marker. 
from the nail plate and from cultured human epidermal cells, 
and then performing co-electrophoresis by two-dimensional 
PAGE (Fig. 5f). The presence of the basic 58K and 56K ker- 
atins in nail was established by two-dimensional gel elec- 
trophoresis in which the first dimensional separation was 
done under nonequilibrium conditions (data not shown). The 
presence of the 58K keratin in nail was also confirmed by im- 
munoblotting using the AE14 antibody which recognizes, in 
addition to the 10-25K high sulfur hair proteins, the 58K ker- 
atin of the epidermis (Fig. 2 d, lane 3). 
Nail, like hair, did not react with AE2 antibody which 
recognizes the 56.5K and 65-67K keratin markers of the 
(""soft-type"")-""keratinization"" or ""skin-type"" differentiation

Figure 6. A schematic diagram of the two-dimensional elec- 
trophoretic pattern of human keratins (a composite of IEF- and 
NEPHGE SDS gel patterns). Keratins are identified by molecular 
weights (×10 -3 ) as well as by catalogue numbers (in parentheses; 
Moll et al., 1982). They are divided into the acidic (type I) and ba- 
sic (type II) subfamilies, according to their relative charges and im- 
munoreactivities. Hard keratins as described in the present work 
are represented by rectangles (H56, H59, H60 of the basic subfam- 
ily, and H44 and H46 of the acidic subfamily). Note that all known 
basic keratins, including those of the hair, are recognized by AE3 
(hatched ovals and rectangles), while many but not all acidic kera- 
tins are recognized by AE1 (solid circles). H44 and H46 keratins 
are recognized by AE13 (dotted rectangles). A (I), acidic type I ker-

et al., 1982, 1984; Cooper et al., 1985). The lack of these 
two epidermal keratins in nail plate proves that the ""soft"" ker- 
atins that we have detected in nail cannot be due to stratum 
corneum contamination. 
Although AE12 and AE13 gave very similar reaction pat- 
terns with human nail keratins, they differ mainly in that 
AE13 sometimes detects an additional, minor, 52K nail com- 
ponent (undetectable by Fast green staining) not seen in hair 
(Fig. 2 c, lane 3; Marshall, 1983). Whether or not this com- 
ponent is truly nail specific will require further investigation. 
Several high molecular weight (100-200K), keratin-re- 
lated species can be detected in nail by immunoblotting. 
They react strongly with AE1 (Fig. 1 d, lane 3, marked with 
circles), but weakly with AE3 (Fig. 1 f, lane 3) and AE13 
(Fig. 2 c, lane 3). Although the significance of these high 
molecular weight bands is not yet clear, they are stable even 
during heating in the presence of SDS and fresh reducing 
agent, suggesting that keratins may be cross-linked (either 
with other keratins or with nonkeratin proteins) through non- 
disulfide, covalent bonds.

known human epithelial keratins including those of the hair

Hair and Nail Equivalents of Other Species 
One- and two-dimensional immunoblot analyses of the hair 
proteins from rabbit (Fig. 7 a, lane 2), mouse (lane 4), and 
sheep (wool; lane 5) demonstrated that they are strikingly 
similar to human hair keratins (lane 1), not only in their 
overall size (Fig. 7 a) and charge (for a comparison of wool 
and human hair keratins by two-dimensional gels, see Fig. 
8), but also in their immunoreactivities with AE3 (Fig. 7 c), 
AE13 (Fig. 7 d), and AE14 antibodies (Fig. 7 e). The pres- 
ence of 50K/58K and 48K/56K soft keratins in nail was also 
confirmed using rabbit claws (Figs. 7, b and c, lane 3). In 
the meantime, our results indicate that there exist some spe- 
cies variations. For example, while AE13 reacts strongly 
with the 44-46K, acidic, hard keratins in all species exam- 
ined (Fig. 7 d), AE12 reacts well only with human and sheep 
antigens (Fig. 7f), suggesting that the two antibodies recog- 
nize distinct epitopes. Another species variation is that, un- 
like human hair keratins which can only be effectively solu- 
bilized after prolonged extraction in 8 M urea at high pH, 
a significant amount of the 56-60 K, basic keratins can be 
solubilized from mature rabbit hair after incubation in 8 M 
urea, 25 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.4), plus 100 mM 2-mercapto-

of this finding is not yet apparent, it raises the cautionary 
note that epidermal keratins extracted from some rodent 
skins using the standard ""urea/reducing agent/neutral pH"" 
protocol could be contaminated by some basic keratins from 
the hair follicles. 
lmmunolocalization of Hard Keratins in Human 
Hair Follicle 
To examine the expression of human hair keratins in various 
parts of the follicle and in different stages of follicular 
differentiation, we performed indirect immunofluorescence 
staining on frozen sections of human scalp skin. Fig. 9, a and 
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 103, 1986

c, shows the staining patterns produced by a polyclonal rabbit 
antiserum raised against total human epidermal keratins 
(Sun and Green, 1978, a and b). This antiserum was not 
found to cross-react with the hair keratins by immunoditfu- 
sion (O'Guin et al., 1986). However, strong staining can be 
seen in both the outer and inner root sheath cells, as well as 
in the cuticle ceils of the hair shaft. On the other hand, cortex 
cells, particularly those located in the deep bulbar region, 
are stained extremely weakly, if at all (Fig. 9, a and c). 
The antibodies AE13 (specific for the acidic hair keratins) 
and AE3 (which reacts with the basic hair keratins) both 
stain intensely the upper cortex and hair cuticle cells (Figs. 
10, a and e, and 11, a and c). This staining is first seen ,x,5-10 
cell layers above the top of the dermal papillae, in an area 
corresponding to the beginning of ""elongation zone"" of the 
follicle (Kemp and Rogers, 1970; Swift, 1977; Orwin, 1979). 
That multiple layers of deep bulbar cells indeed do not react 
with AE13 was confirmed by double-staining using both 
mouse AE13 and a rabbit antiserum against laminin which 
delineates the basement membrane zone (Fig. 10, a-c). Since 
AE3 cross-reacts with all known keratins of the basic sub- 
family, this antibody also stains the soft keratin-containing 
outer root sheath (Fig. 11, a and c). The inner root sheath 
layers, however, are not stained with either AE3 or AE13 
(Fig. 10, c and e). 
The AE14 antibody selectively stains the relatively ma- 
tured cortical cells (Fig. 12 a). Compared with AE3 or AE13 
staining, this staining starts in a much more advanced region 
where the thin (2-3 layered) bulbar outer root sheath is 
replaced by a much thicker (>5-6 layered) outer root sheath 
(Fig. 12 a). This area is equivalent to the upper ""elongation"" 
or lower ""keratogenous"" zone (Orwin, 1979). Since AE14 an- 
tibody cross-reacts with the 58K soft keratin (Fig. 2 d, lane 
1 ), it also stains the basal cells of almost all stratified squa- 
mous epithelia including the isthmus outer root sheath (Fig. 
12, a and c, and data not shown). 
The differential expression of keratins and the AE14- 
positive antigens in various parts of human hair follicle is 
summarized in Table I (see Discussion). 
Discussion 
Defining Subclasses of Human Hair Keratins Using 
Monoclonal Antibodies 
Using AE3, AE12, and AE13 antibodies, we have identified 
in human hair fibers two keratins, designated 44K and 46K, 
which belong to the acidic (type I) subfamily, and three kera- 
tins, 56K, 59K, and 60K, which belong to the basic (type 
II) subfamily. In vitro translation experiments have previ- 
ously suggested that similar keratins in guinea pig, sheep, 
and mouse probably represent products of distinct genes 
rather than variants arising from posttranslational processing 
(Steinert and Rogers, 1971; Ward and Karmarick, 1980; Ber- 
tolino et al., 1982). Traditionally called low sulfur keratins, 
these proteins belong to the intermediate filament family of 
proteins (Fig. 4 b), are highly conserved across mammalian 
species (Fig. 7), and can always be divided into two mutually 
exclusive subfamilies according to their size, charge, and im- 
Figure 11. Immunofluorescent staining of a human scalp hair follicle 
using AE3 mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the basic 
56-60K low sulfur hair keratin and other basic ""soft"" keratins, a and 
c show AE3 staining, and b and d are their corresponding phase- 
contrast images. Symbols are the same as Fig. 9. Note the strong 
staining of upper cortical and hair cuticle cells, and very weak stain-

munoreactivities with our AE13 and AE3 monoclonal anti- 
bodies (Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 7; Gillespie and Marshall, 1977; 
Hewish et al., 1984). 
In addition to the low sulfur keratins, human hair fibers 
also contain a family of 10-25K, AE14-reactive molecules 
(Fig. 2 d, lane 2). Based on their molecular weight and spe- 
cies distribution, we have tentatively identified these as high 
sulfur proteins. Although historically also known as kera- 
tins, they are much smaller than the usual 40-70K size range 
of intermediate filament subunits, they lack the epitope rec- 
ognized by alF antibody (Fig. 1 c), and they probably form 
the interfilament matrix (Gillespie, 1983). Therefore, these 
proteins may correspond to what is now generally considered 
as ""intermediate filament-associated proteinsY 
The significance of the common AE14-epitope shared by 
the 10-25K putative high sulfur proteins and the 58K ""soft"" 
keratin (No. 5; which is not present in hair fibers) is cur- 
rently unclear, and one cannot rule out the possibility that 
this cross-reaction is purely by chance (Wehland et al., 
1984). Nevertheless, the specificity of AE14 antibody makes 
it useful for the positive identification and localization of the 
58K keratin in non-hair/nail epithelia. 
The Number of Known Human Keratins 
The two-dimensional PAGE patterns of known human kera- 
tins including those of the hair and nail are summarized sche- 
matically in Fig. 6. The number of known human keratins 
has therefore reached 23-24 (including 18-19 soft keratins; 
Moll et al., 1982; Sun et al., 1984). However, this number 
does not take into account (a) keratin isomers resulting from 
posttranslational modifications (Sun and Green, 1978a; 
Steinert and Idler, 1979; Gilmartin et al., 1984) or minor se- 
quence variations (Tyner et al., 1985; Wild and Mischke, 
1986), (b) the various keratin-associated proteins such as 
filaggrin, high sulfur, or high glycine/tyrosine proteins (Dale 
et al., 1985), or (c) the inner root sheath keratins that are 
potentially distinct but have not yet been isolated in intact 
form due to a high degree of isopeptide cross-linking 
(Gillespie, 1983). 
Relationship between Soft and Hard Keratins 
From the diagram in Fig. 6, it is apparent that, within each 
of the two keratin subfamilies, the hair keratins are among 
the most acidic. Based on this subfamily classification and 
the well-established requirement (in soft keratins) of at least 
one basic and one acidic subunit for filament assembly (Lee 
and Baden, 1976; Steinert et al., 1976; Hatzfeld and Franke, 
1985; Eichner et al., 1986), it seems almost certain that both 
acidic and basic hair keratins will be required for filament 
formation (cf., Ahmadi and Speakman, 1978; Gruen and 
Woods, 1983). 
Within the category of soft keratins, most acidic keratins 
form pairs with specific basic keratins as defined by (a) fre-

quent coexpression (Sun et al., 1984), (b) shared epitopes 
as recognized by monoclonal antibodies (e.g., 56.5K and 
65-67K keratins share the epitope recognized by AE2, and 
45K and 52K keratins share the epitope recognized by 6.11 
antibody; reviewed in Cooper et al., 1985), and (c) preferen- 
tial in vitro interaction (Franke et al., 1983; Eichner et al., 
1986). Our immunolocalization and tissue distribution data 
strongly suggest that the acidic 44K/46K and basic 56-60K 
hair keratins are co-expressed and thus may be regarded as 
another ""keratin-pair"" that may serve as a marker for ""hair/ 
nail-type"" epithelial differentiation (Table II). 
The question arises why are there multiple acidic and basic 
members within the hair keratin ""pair"" Actually, the exis- 
tence of a keratin ""pair"" comprised of more than two poly- 
peptides is not without precedent. For example, in the ""skin- 
type"" differentiation pair, the two basic polypeptides, 65K 
and 67K, are matched with the 56.5K acidic polypeptide (Ta- 
ble II). As keratin pairs are defined by the specific co- 
expression of both the acidic and basic members in a dif- 
ferentiation-dependent manner, co-regulated polypeptides 
within the same subfamily may be regarded, at least concep- 
tually, as one member of a pair. Whether the 44K and 46K 
hair components (or the 56K/59K/60K component) are 
functionally identical or different remains to be determined. 
An interesting feature of keratin pairs is that in most cases 
the basic member is larger than the acidic one by 8-10K (Sun 
et al., 1984). Recent DNA sequencing data suggest that this 
mass difference is due to the presence of specific ""HI"" and 
""H2"" domains bracketing the central alpha-helical segment 
of the basic keratins (Steinert etal., 1985). Whether a similar 
situation exists for the hair keratins and why the basic and 
acidic members of the hair pair differ by 12-14K instead of 
the usual 8-10K is unclear. 
Differential Expression of Hair Proteins 
The fact that AE3 (recognizing the basic, type II, hair kera- 
tins) and AE13 (specific for the acidic, type I, hair keratins) 
stain identically the upper cell layers of hair matrix (Figs. 10 
and 11) suggests that the basic and acidic hair keratins appear 
coordinately during advanced stages of hair differentiation. 
Although the absence of hair-specific keratins in matrix 
basal cells will have to be confirmed eventually by direct bio- 
chemical analysis, our finding is consistent with the morpho- 
logical observation that lower bulbar cells contain relatively 
few desmosome-associated, 10-nm filaments (Birbeck and 
Mercer, 1957; Roth and Helwig, 1964; Hashimoto and Shi- 
bazaki, 1976). The suprabasal location of hair-specific kera- 
tins is also in keeping with our current concept that most, 
and probably all, of the larger molecular weight, differentia- 
tion-specific (soft) keratin pairs are suprabasally expressed 
(Table II). These include the 56.5K/65-67K keratin markers 
for ""skin-type"" differentiation (Woodcock-Mitchell et al., 
1982), the 55K/64K keratin markers for ""corneal-type"" dif- 
ferentiation (Schermer etal., 1986), and the 51K/59K keratins 
markers for ""esophageal-type"" differentiation (Schermer, A., 
and T.-T. Sun, unpublished data; Table II). If the hair keratin 
pair indeed falls into this category, we can predict that its ex- 
pression will be differentiation dependent; i.e., its synthesis 
will be modulated greatly depending on the growth and dif- 
ferentiated state of the matrix cells (for a discussion see 
Cooper etal., 1985). 
The 10-25K high-sulfur proteins, as defined by our AE14 
antibody, are first detected in cortex •20-30 cell layers 
above the basal cells (Fig. 12). A related finding is that inter- 
mediate filament bundles isolated by Jones and Pope (1985) 
from the lower bulb of human hair follicles do not contain 
high sulfur proteins. Although this finding alone does not 
prove that high sulfur proteins are absent from the lower hair

bulb, since they could have been lost during the isolation pro- 
cedure, when taken together with our immunofluorescent 
staining data (Figs. 10-12) it supports the notion that the syn- 
thesis of the tow sulfur keratins precedes that of the high sul- 
fur proteins (for an opposing view, see Fraser, 1969). These 
results are also consistent with the earlier suggestion that 
high-sulfur proteins may function as a matrix only during ad- 
vanced stages of hair formation (Fraser et al., 1972). In this 
regard, it would be interesting to see whether high sulfur 
proteins of the hair can induce the aggregation of in vitro- 
assembled hair, nail, or epidermal keratin filaments (Dale et 
al., 1985). 
Our immunohistochemical staining data also yield infor- 
mation on the keratin composition of the inner root sheath 
and the hair cuticle. Since no AE3 or AEI3 staining was ob- 
served in inner root sheath (Figs. 10 and 11), our immunolog- 
ical data support the current belief that keratin filaments of 
inner root sheath are distinct from those of the cortex 
(Steinert et al., 1971; Steinert, 1978). 
In cuticle cells, x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy 
have failed to reveal any alpha-helical, fibrous elements 
(Birkbeck, 1964), and it has been stated that wool and kan- 
garoo hair cuticles do not contain any low sulfur keratins 
(e.g., Crewther, 1976). But the fact that human cuticle cells 
are stained by our AE13 and AE3 antibodies (Figs. 10 e and 
11 c) strongly suggests that these cells contain keratin-related 
antigens. On the other hand, since cuticle cells are AE14 
negative, they probably do not contain the 10-25K high sul- 
fur proteins (Fig. 12 c). This finding, of course, does not ex- 
clude the possibility that the cuticle cells, which are known 
to be cystine-rich (Lindley, 1977; Spearman, 1977 a, b), may 
express some other forms of high sulfur components (Crew- 
ther, 1976; Frater, 1976). In support of this possibility, Ley 
and Crewther (1980) have actually isolated and characterized 
some so-called ultra-high-sulfur proteins that appear to be 
enriched in the cuticle. 
Nail Plate Contains Hair Keratins in Addition to the 
50K/58K and 48K/56K Soft Keratins 
It has been reported that keratins of human nail are almost 
identical to those of the hair (Baden et al., 1973; Marshall, 
1983; cf. Marshall and Gillespie, 1977), and that nail keratins 
do not cross-react with antisera to epidermal keratins (Lee 
et al., 1976; Baden and Kubilus, 1983, 1984; cf., O'Guin et 
al., 1986). However, our data indicate that nail plate con- 
tains, in addition to an apparently complete set of hair kera- 
tins, ~10-20% of soft keratins. Furthermore, immunoblot- 
ting data have allowed us to identify these ""soft"" keratins 
as the 50K/58K keratin pair which we have previously 
identified in the basal cells of several stratified squamous 
epithelia (Woodcock-Mitchell et al., 1982; Schermer et al., 
1986), and the 48K/56K keratin pair which is characteristic 
of most ""hyperproliferative"" keratinocytes (Weiss et al., 
1984). The presence of the 50K/58K and 48K/56K keratin 
pairs in nail plate is entirely consistent with nail matrix being 
an unusually thick, and therefore probably highly prolifera- 
tive, stratified squamous epithelium (Zaias and Alvarez, 
1968). The ""non-keratinized"" morphology (i.e., lacking a 
well-defined granular layer) of nail matrix is also consistent 
with the absence of the 56.5K/65-67K keratin markers of 
""keratinization"" or, as we have proposed recently as an alter- 
native and perhaps less confusing term, ""skin-type differenti- 
ation"" (Cooper et al., 1985; Cooper and Sun, 1986). 
The fact that nail plate and mature hair share a similar set 
of major hard keratins (Figs. 1, 2, and 5) supports the notion 
that the precursor cells (matrix) that give rise to the nail plate 
and hair cortex share a common pathway of terminal differ- 
entiation (cf., Baden et al., 1973). 
Concluding Remarks 
Studies on hair follicle differentiation have been hindered by 
the extreme complexity of hair proteins. However, through 
the use of monoclonal antibodies we have been able to distin- 
guish immunologically several classes of hair-specific mark- 
ers, and to correlate them with the classically defined stages 
of histological differentiation. A detailed analysis of the ex- 
pression of these markers should lead to a better understand- 
ing of the mechanisms of hair development, growth and dis- 
order.

publication, Held, H. W., E. Werner, and W. W. Franke (Differentiation,

hair roots, and provided evidence that all of the human hard keratins, similar 
to those described here, are distinct translational products [4 acidic (Hal-4)

A KEY ROLE IN BLEOMYCIN-INDUCED
PNEUMOPATHY AND FIBROSIS

Pulmonary fibrosis corresponds to the end stage of various pulmonary diseases
that are characterized by the growth offibroblasts and the increase of collagen depo-
sition within the alveolar walls (reviewed in references 1-3) . Their pathogenesis is
poorly understood and the involvement of fibroblast growth factors, known to be
produced by alveolar macrophages, is suspected (4, 5). TNFalcachectin is one of
the cytokines produced by macrophages activated by inflammatory agents such as
bacterial LPS. TNF has a wide range of activities (reviewed in references 6 and 7),
one ofthese being agrowth-promoting activity upon fibroblast cell lines (8). In vivo,
we recently found that acontinuous infusion ofTNF within the hypodermis stimu-
lated the growth offibroblasts and led to an increase of the local collagen deposition
(Piguet, P R, G. E. Grau, and P. Vassalli, manuscript submitted for publication) .
Bleomycin corresponds to a group of glycopeptides that are used for the chemo-
therapy of cancer, a therapy that is, however, limited by the occurrence of pulmo-
nary fibrosis . In rodents the administration of bleomycin has been extensively used
as a model of pulmonary fibrosis (reviewed in reference 2). In the present study,
the role ofTNFin the bleomycin-induced pneumopathy and fibrosis was investigated .
The evolution of the fibrotic process was found to be associated with an increase
in the level of lung TNF mRNA, suggesting an increase in local TNF production .
Furthermore, injection of rabbit antiTNF antibody markedly prevented the devel-
opment of pulmonary lesions and fibrosis . These experiments are consistent with
a key role for TNF in at least some types of pulmonary fibrosis .

Mice.
CBAJCa and C57BLt10 (1110) mice were purchased from OLAC Ltd. (Blackthorn,
UK) and bred for two to three generations in our animal facilities .
Bleomycin Administration.
Bleomycin (Lundbeck AVS, Kopenhagen, Denmark) was dis-
solved in HBSS and 0.1 U in 0.1 ml was injected intratracheally. 0.1 Uofbleomycin contained
1 ng of LPS in a limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. The controls were injected with HBSS
only. Continuous intraperitoneal administration was performed using an Alzet osmotic mini-
pump (no. 2002 Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA) delivering a total dose of 2 U within 15 d.

Lightand Electron Microscopy.
The lungs were fixed by intracheal instillation offormol sub-
limate and embedded within paraffin . Sections were stained by the hematoxilin-eosin and
Masson trichrome stains. For a semiquantitative evaluation of the extent of lung damage,
sections from the right and left lung of individual mice were projected on a multipurpose
grid with 168 points . The number of points falling on normal or severely damaged tissue
was established . This gave an approximative evaluation of the percentage ofdamaged paren-
chyma . For embedding in epon, the lungs were fixed by intratracheal instillation of 2%
glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.2) . Sections were prepared from three blocks
from the left lung for each individual mouse and were stained with toluidine blue . For EM,
700-A ultrathin sections were stained with 1% uranyl acetate in 100% methanol and lead
citrate and were examined with an electron microscope (400 ; Philips Electronic Instruments,
Inc ., Mahwah, NJ) at 80 Kv.
Northern Blot Analysis of TNF-a, IL-1-a, and Granulocyte-macrophage CSF(GM-CSF)' mRNAs
in Total Lung RNA.
The lungs were washed with saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen . They
were subsequently thawed by mincing in a guanidine-thiocyanate solution and the total lung
RNA was isolated by guanidine-thiocyanate/cesium chloride centrifugation (11). Northern
blots were performed as described elsewhere (12) . Briefly, RNAs denatured with glyoxal were
separated on 1.2% agarose gels (4 jig/lane) and were transferred onto nylon membranes.
Equality of sample loading and efficiency of the transfer were controlled by staining with
methylene blue . Filters were hybridized with 12P-labeled cRNA probes (13) . The probes for
TNFa, IL-1-a, and GM-CSF have been described elsewhere (12, 13) .
Rabbit Anti-mouse TNFAntibodies.
Mouse rTNFa was a kind gift from B . Allet Glaxo,
IMB, Geneva, Switzerland . Purification of the cytokine and the preparation of rabbit anti-
TNF antibody have been described previously (14) . IgG fraction from antiTNF or normal
serum were deaggregated by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 g for 150 min, and 1 mg was in-
jected intravenously.
Evaluation ofthe Lung Hydroxyproline Content.
The total lung hydroxyproline concentration
was determined using described methods (15) . Briefly, the lungs were submitted to an acid
hydrolysis, the hydrolysate was neutralized, extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcool,
and the hydroxyproline concentraton was determined colorimetrically (15) .
Statistical Evaluation .
Statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric Mann-
Whitney U test .
Results
Intratracheal Instillation ofBleomycin Increases the TNFmRNA Level in the Lung Whereas
Those of Interleukin 1 and GM-CSF Remain Undetectable.
Bleomycin administration
did not lead to a detectable increase of the serum TNF activity (not shown) . How-
ever, evidence for a local increase of TNF production was provided by the analysis
of the lung TNF mRNA level . RNA from the lungs of individual mice were ex-
tracted and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization at various times after intracheal
instillation of bleomycin (Fig . 1) . An increase ofTNF mRNA level was not apparent
2 d after bleomycin instillation (not shown), but was detectable in 12 mice killed
between day 5 and 15 (Fig . 1) . In contrast, the mRNAs for IL-1 and GM-CSF were
not detectable after instillation of bleomycin, but evident 1-2 h after LPS injection
(Fig. 2) .

The bleomycin instillation induced some mortality, ranging between 0 and 30% in
different experiments, and this was not significantly affected by the treatment with
antiTNF IgG (not shown) . Study of histological sections suggested that mortality
was related either to extensive lung damage (see below) or to infectious complica-
tions that were occasionally observed in mice receiving antiTNF IgG. Indeed, this
treatment is known to compromise the resistance to some bacteria (16) . Bleomycin
administration also led to a weight loss that was partially prevented by antiTNF
antibody. The body weight of the saline instilled controls were of77% (±12) or 85%
( t 17) for the mice treated with nonimmune or antiTNF IgG, respectively (mean

showed areas of increase of the cellularity of the alveolar septa associated with a
total disruption of the alveolar architecture (Fig . 3) . Collagen deposition, revealed
with the trichrome stain, was seen in the most severely damaged area . Because of
their heterogeneity in the different lobes, these alterations were difficult to quantify.
Sections from the right and left lungs ofseven mice treated with antiTNF or nonim-
mune IgG were examined . The severely damaged area (i .e ., disruption of the al-
veolae and presence of collagen) represented 45 ( ±25) and 15 % ( t 12) for the mice
treated with nonimmune and antiTNF IgG, respectively (mean t SD).
To evaluate more directly the collagen deposition, the total lung hydroxyproline
content was determined . After single intratracheal administration ofbleomycin, the
lung hydroxyproline content was increased by -50% after 15 d. This increase was
nearly completely prevented by injection of antiTNF antibody (Fig . 4) .
Role of T Lymphocytes in the Pneumopathy and the TNF mRNA Accumulation.
Since
athymic nude mice are resistant to the bleomycin-induced pneumopathy (17), Tlym-
phocytes are suspected of being involved . It has been shown previously that treat-
ment in vivo with anti CD4 or CD8 mAb results in significant or complete depletion
of the respective T lymphocyte subset (9). The pulmonary fibrosis, measured by
the lung hydroxyproline content, was to some extent attenuated by the deletion of
the CD4 or the CD8 T lymphocyte subset and completely prevented by treatment

with both mAbs (Fig. 5) . Furthermore, the bleomycin-induced increase ofTNF mRNA
level was prevented by the combined treatment with the anti-CD4 and CD8 mAbs,
when examined on day 5 (Fig. 1) or 15 (not shown) .
Effect ofAnti-TNFAntibody on Pulmonary Lesions Produced by Intraperitoneal Administra-
tion ofBleomycin.
Administration ofbleomycin by intraperitoneal injection does not
lead to a rapid fibrosis (18) ; 15 d after acontinuous injection ofa total dose of 2 U of
bleomycin, the increase ofthe lung collagen content, measured by the total hydroxy-
proline content, was N5% above the controls receiving the solvent only (not shown) .
However, an alveolar damage was evident that, in contrast to that induced by intra-
tracheal instillation, was diffuse and therefore easier to quantify. Alveolar oedema
and thickening of the alveolar septa were evident by light microscopy (Fig. 6 B),
while epithelial and endothelial cells damage were evident when examined on the
electron micrographs (Fig. 6D) . These alterations were attenuated or absent in mice
passively immunized with antiTNF IgG (Fig . 6, A-D) .
Discussion
The administration of bleomycin in rodents is a model for alveolar damage and
pulmonary fibrosis (2). The reason for the predominant pulmonary damage after
bleomycin injection is probably related to the fate of the drug, which is found local-
ized within the alveolar epithelium 3-4 d after an intravenous injection (19) . 5 d
after intratracheal injection, an increase of the TNF mRNA level is evident (Fig .
1) . This increase is relatively moderate in comparison with that induced by a lethal
dose of LPS (Fig .
1), but much more sustained since it is detectable during 2 wk
after a single bleomycin injection, compared with only 2-3 h after LPS. This obser-
vation raises the question of whether a local increase of the TNF production plays
some role in the antineoplastic effects of bleomycin.
The bleomycin-induced pneumopathy is not a direct result of a toxicity of the
drug since it involves a T cell-mediated immune response. This is indicated by an
influx of T lymphocytes within the lung 3-4 d after bleomycin instillation (20) and
by the resistance of the athymic nude mice to bleomycin (17) . In agreement with
those observations, the present experiments provide two additional informations .
First, either the CD4+ or CD8 * T lymphocyte subset alone is capable of inducing
some degree offibrotic response (Fig . . 5), and second, the presence ofthe Tlympho-
cytes is required for an increase of pulmonary TNF mRNA level (Fig . 1) .
The cellular origin of the pulmonary TNF has not yet been established and may
involve more than one cell variety. Macrophages are in quantitative terms the most

important producers ofTNF (6, 7), and the involvement ofthe alveolar and intersti-
tial population is likely. T lymphocytes can also release TNF (21), but the absence
of detectable GM-CSF mRNA (Fig . 2), a cytokine usually produced by activated
T lymphocytes, suggests that their number within the lung and their direct contri-
bution to the TNF production is moderate . It appears more likely that T lympho-
cytes increase, by the secretion ofother cytokines, both the number of macrophages
and their activation to secrete TNF, as appears to be the case in other types of T
cell-induced and TNF-mediated immunopathological reactions (22) .
The various components of bleomycin-inducedpneumopathy (i.e ., alveolar damage,
growth ofinterstitial fibroblasts, deposition of collagen [18, 19, 23]) were influenced
by the administration of antiTNF antibody. This observation has to be related to
the effects of TNF upon the alveolar walls and the fibrotic process. When delivered
intravenously, TNF induces a diffuse alveolar damage, notably with necrosis of alve-
olar epithelial and endothelial cells (24, 25). TNF also exerts a growth-promoting
activity upon fibroblasts, since asubcutaneous continuous infusion leads to a marked

increase offibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition (Piguet, P F, G. E. Grau,
and P Vassalli, manuscript submitted for publication) . Thus, the susceptibility of
the lesions to the antiTNF antibody, as well as the capacity ofTNF to induce alve-
olar damage and fibrosis, strongly suggests that TNF is indeed the effector of both
alveolar damage and fibrosis. Avariety ofother cytokines have been shown to influence
fibroblasts in vitro, such as platelet-derived growth factor (26), IL-1 (27), andTGF0
(28) . A further element of complexity results from the possibility that these medi-
ators mayinduce each other, as it has been demonstrated for the induction ofplatelet-
derived growth factor and IL-1 by TNF (29). In this context, the striking influence
of antiTNF antibody upon the collagen deposition might indicate that other medi-
ators are not produced in significant quantities, an interpretation that, in the case
of IL-1, is supported by the absence of detectable IL-1 mRNA (Fig. 2) . Alterna-
tively, or in addition, their involvement might be dependent upon THE
In conclusion, the following evidences are in favor of a key role of TNF in the
various components of the bleomycin-induced pneumopathy: first, TNFcan induce
alveolar damage, fibroblast growth, and collagen deposition ; second, a single injec-
tion of bleomycin induces a sustained increase of the TNF mRNA level within the
lung; and third, antiTNF antibody prevents the bleomycin-induced alveolar damage,
growth of fibroblasts, and collagen deposition . Recent experiments in our labora-
tory indicate that this conclusion is also valid for pulmonary fibrosis induced by
silica particles .
Summary
The role ofTNFa/cachectin in the pneumopathy elicited by bleomycin has been
investigated . After a single intratracheal bleomycin instillation, an increase of the
lung TNFa mRNA level was evident, from days 5 to 15, as shown by Northern
gel analysis ofwhole lung RNA. In contrast, lung IL-1-a and GM-CSF mRNA were
not detectable . In mice passively immunized with rabbit anti-mouse TNFa IgG,
the bleomycin-induced collagen deposition, evaluated by the total lung hydroxypro-
line assayon day 15, was prevented. Depletion of the CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes
by an in vivo treatment with mAb prevented the bleomycin-induced increase ofTNF
mRNA level and fibrosis . After an administration of bleomycin in continuous in-
traperitoneal perfusion, the diffuse alveolar damage observed by light and electron
microscopy was almost completely prevented by antiTNF antibody. These results
indicate that in response to bleomycin, the T lymphocytes induce, by an undefined
mechanism, an increase of the pulmonary TNF production, which leads to alveolar
damage, growth of fibroblast, and collagen deposition.

CASE REPORT
ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA BETWEEN THE
HEPATIC ARTERY AND THE HEPATIC VEIN

and ANTHONY M. IANNONE

(Received 12 February 1988; in final form 24 May 1988)
A patient is presented with multiple vascular anomalies in the branches of the celiac axis as well as in
the portal vein and its branches. Apparently, unique in the literature is the presence of a large ar-
teriovenous fistula between the hepatic artery and one of the hepatic veins. The anomalies are presumed
to be congenital in origin.
KEY WORDS: Arteriovenous fistula, hepatic artery, hepatic vein
This report describes a fistula, apparently congenital, between the hepatic artery
and an hepatic vein. As the authors could find no report of a similar anomaly, the
following case review is presented.
An 80 year old white female was admitted to the Medical College of Ohio Hospital
in 1987 because of generalized seizures. The seizures consisted of catatonic, jerking
movements of her upper and lower extremities, lasting 3-4 hours. Several months
prior to this admission, dysthymic rhythmic movements of her lips and tongue had
been noted. She had then been hospitalized in another hospital because of the
seizures and for the treatment of pulmonary emphysema. She was found to be
hypertensive and hypothyroid. A tentative diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy has
been made and she had been placed on anticonvulsant therapy.
Except for the above findings, her physical examination was negative. Neither
her liver nor spleen was palpable. No vascular bruit could be heard over the
abdomen. She was not jaundiced nor was there ascites.
A careful review of her history gave no evidence of significant trauma, jaundice,
hepatic disease, nor acute illness of any type. Her family history, although incom-
plete, was negative for hepatic, vascular or other anomalies.
Her biochemical and hematological profiles were essentially normal except that
while septic, her SGOT, SGPT, LDH and alkaline phosphatase levels were mildly
elevated. Her serum bilirubin level was normal.
Following
a normal electroencephalography and CT scan of the brain,
a
neurological diagnosis of tardine dyskinesia was made. Meanwhile, she became
febrile and consideration was given to the possibility of an abdominal infection.

RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS
An ultrasound scan of the gallbladder revealed a sonolucent lesion within the right
lobe of the liver (Figure 1) which, in light of the clinical findings, was initially
interpreted as a possible hepatic abscess. ACT scan of the abdomen (Figures 2 A
& B), showed a 9.0
7.5 cm low attenuation lesion within the anterior aspect of
the right lobe of the liver. Following intravenous contrast a rounded, enhancing
structure was noted within its central portion. A contrast outlined a linear shaped
structure which coursed inferiolaterally to the spherical structure. This was inter-
preted as a vascular malformation with a surrounding area of necrosis, requiring
arteriography for better delineation.
The celiac axis angiogram (Figure 3A) revealed an anomalous right hepatic
artery originating as a separate trunk proximal to the origins of the main hepatic
and splenic arteries. In the arterial phase, numerous fusiform and occasional small
saccular aneurysms were noted within the gastroepiploic, splenic and hepatic ar-
teries. Fed by the right hepatic artery, the contrast outlined the above spherical
mass which was visualized early in the arterial phase and corresponded to the
findings described on both the CT and ultrasound examinations. The linear enhanc-
ing structure on the CT was found to be a large hepatic vein which drained
promptly into the inferior vena cava during the arterial phase of this study. A
second large malformation was noted inferior-medially to the above described
lesion. This lesion reached its peak contrast enhancement during the venous phase

formation (open arrow) is also noted. Multiple small fusiform and saccular aneurysms are seen through-
out the arterial distribution (arrowheads).
(Figure 3B). It appeared to be supplied both by the hepatic artery and the portal
vein. The first lesion was apparently supplied by an hepatic artery only since it
washed out almost completely on the venous phase. Two other spherical malforma-
tions were noted on the venous phase. These lesions, in retrospect, were also
present on the patient’s CT scan. In addition to the malformations noted on the
venous phase, note was made of poor filling of the normal intrahepatic portal-vein
branches. Tortuous collateral vessels coursed inferiorly from the splenic vessels,
suggesting an element of portal hypertension.
SUBSEQUENT COURSE
The patient was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics, following the culture of E.
coli from the blood stream. The source of infection was thought to be the upper
urinary tract. She continued to improve and was discharged without evidence of
infection and with her seizures under control.

Showing venous phase of the angiogram. Washout of the malformation supplied by the
artery only is noted (arrow). Additional malformations supplied by the portal vein (arrowheads) are
also noted.
She has been followed as an outpatient for the ensuing year and has remained
stable without loss of weight, sepsis or new manifestations of any underlying
problem. Critical examination of her vascular system has remained otherwise unre-
vealing. A recent nuclear magnetic resonance study of her brain revealed only
evidence of mild atrophy.
DISCUSSION
Following the CT scan, a diagnostic aspiration of the hepatic lesion had been con-
sidered. As subsequently indicated by the arteriogram, intraperitoneal hemorrhage
might have ensued. The arteriovenous fistula between the hepatic artery and the
hepatic vein was an unsuspected finding prior to the CT scan and arteriogram. Its
etiology remains uncertain but the diffuse nature of the malformation and its as-
sociation with other vascular abnormalities suggest a congenital origin.
Review of the literature reveals numerous reports of fistulae between the hepatic
artery and the portal vein, some being the result of congenital anomalies, others
160
J.M. HOWARD et al.
being the result of trauma1’2’3’4’5 including complication of percutaneous transhepa-
tic cholangiography. Portal hypertension sometimes resulted. Multiple aneurysms
of the viscera, especially_ of the renal arteries, are recognized as a manifestation of
polyarteritis nodosa6’7’8’9’1. Our patient’s abdominal aortogram revealed evidence
of fibromuscular hyperplasia of the renal arteries but no evidence of a renal artery
aneurysm.
Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome was also considered as it may include arterio-
venous communications plus psychiatric disturbances but supporting evidence was
not apparent.
Martin, Benzing, and Kaplan
11 reported that a 3 year old was found to have a
fistula between a branch of the right hepatic artery and the ductus venosus. This
was cured by operative interruption of the arterial branch near the fistula. The
anomaly was anatomically different from that presented by our patient but the
physiological effects would be qualitatively similar.
The neurologic disorder appeared to the authors to be unusual. Although the
CT and NMR scans of the brain were normal, arteriography of the brain would
have been of interest. Clinically, it does not seem justifiable.
Consideration was given to the possibility of bacterial vegetations associated with
the A-V fistula but this remains conjectural.

A case of fibrous histiocytoma of low grade malignancy arising from the uncinate lobe of the pancreas is
reported. This is an unusual site for these extremely rare tumours. Survival up to 4 years has been achieved
in our patient following surgical resection.
KEY WORDS: Adult, pancreas neoplasms, fibrous histiocytoma, pathology, treatment, case report.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma of variable behaviour
that is usually found in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper and lower limbs1. Less
common primary sites are the retroperitoneal tissues and the head and neck. This
report describes a patient with a fibrous histiocytoma of low grade malignancy arising
from the uncinate lobe of the pancreas where early presentation and surgical
treatment have resulted in a curative resection.
CASE REPORT
A 77 year old male presented in February 1983 with anorexia, epigastric discomfort,
heartburn, weight loss of 16 kg in nine months and general malaise. On examination,
he was thin, with a blood pressure of 180/80 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 70/min. There
was a non-tender mass approximately 10 cm in diameter palpable in the epigastrium
and this was not attached to superficial structures and did not move with respiration.
CAT scan of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a large rounded mass

approximately 10 cm
8 cm in the region of the head of the pancreas. There was no
para-aortic lymph node enlargement. Coeliac axis angiography indicated that the
mass was supplied by the gastroduodenal artery and vessels arising from the head of
the pancreas. Biochemical screen was normal but the serum amylase estimation was
at the upper limit of normal (85 units per litre).
Operation Report
On 9th February 1984, the abdomen was explored through a right upper paramedian
laparotomy incision. A mobile lobulated tumour was found arising from the inferior
aspect of the pancreas immediately to the right of the superior mesenteric vein. The
tumour had a well defined capsule and could be readily dissected away from the
adjacent duodenum and transverse colon. Care was required to avoid injury to the
superior mesenteric vessels on the medial side of the tumour. The base of the tumour
was attached to the inferior aspect of the pancreas in front of the third part of the
duodenum. The pendunculated tumour mass was removed with a narrow cuff of
pancreatic tissue. A short vascular pedicle arose from the inferior pancreatico-
duodenal vessels. The pedicle was secured and the abdomen closed after inserting a
suction drain.
Pathology
Macroscopically, the resected tumour was a lobulated, rubbery mass of tissue
measuring 12.5cm
10cm
6cm and weighed 337 grams (Figure 1). The cut surface
was tan in colour and there was a small central area of calcification. Microscopically,
the tumour was composed of whorls of spindle cells with bundles of collagen tissue
(Figure 2). Foci of polygonal cells with foamy cytoplasm indicating a histocytic
component were evident (Figure 3). Mitotic figures averaged 2 per 10 high power
field. The tumour contained a fine thin capsule. These findings were compatible with
a diagnosis of fibrous histiocytoma of low grade malignancy. Electron microscopy
examination showed that the tumour was of fibrohistiocytic type widely scattered
within a matrix containing numerous collagen bundles,
fibrillar material and
considerable numbers of plasma cells. The majority of the cells were of the
fibroblastic type with isolated histiocytic cells.
DISCUSSION
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the gastrointestinal tract is being reported more
2
frequently. One probable case ofmalignant fibrous histiocytoma of the pancreas has
3
been reported
in a patient who presented with obstructive jaundice. On that
occasion, the tumour arose in the head of the pancreas and necessitated pancreatico-
duodenectomy.
In the Japanese literature a case of malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the pancreas
arising from the tail of the pancreas in a 44 year old male has been
4
reported. This
patient presented with fever, weight loss and fatigue and there was a mass measuring
25cm in diameter in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The tumour was imaged

angiography showed it to be supplied by branches of the pancreatic artery from the
body of the pancreas. This patient was operated on the 5/3/85 and a tumour which
weighed 8.16kg was removed (operative details not documented). This patient was
evidently alive 15 months after the operation.
In our patient, the proximity of the tumour to the duodenum resulted in a
comparatively early clinical presentation due to obstructive symptoms and, at
laparotomy, the tumour was easily dissected from the surrounding duodenum and
superior mesenteric vessels.
The role of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy for this type of tumour has
been canvassed but the response to treatment has been variable. Certainly when
metastases are present these treatment modalities afford little prolongation of the
median survival time5.
Ultimate prognosis for a patient from whom this type of tumour has been removed
is difficult to estimate due to the paucity of data, but surgical resection of the tumour
was possible in our patient and there were no demonstrable lymph nodes involved.
He remains alive and well 4 years following resection.

Abstract. An extended synthetic oligonucleotide 
(58-mer) has been used to identify and characterize a 
human liver gap junction eDNA. The eDNA is 1,574 
bases long and contains the entire coding region for a 
gap junction protein. In vitro translation of the RNA 
products of this eDNA is consistent with it coding for 
a 32,022-D protein. Southern blot analysis indicates 
that the gap junction gene is present as a single copy, 
and that it can be detected in a variety of organisms 
using the human liver eDNA as a probe. The human 
cDNA has been used to screen a rat liver eDNA li- 
brary, and a rat liver junction eDNA clone has been 
isolated. The rat liver clone is 1,127 bases in length, 
and it has strong sequence homology to the human 
cDNA in the protein-coding region, but less extensive 
homology in the 3'-untranslated region. 
M 
OST eukaryotic tissues contain cell-cell communi- 
cation pathways or electrical synapses that permit 
the transfer of information, in the form of small 
molecules, to occur between cells. Due to these junctions, 
all the cells in a communicating tissue potentially share a 
pool of small ions and metabolites, such as nucleotides, 
amino acids, oligosaccharides, and second messengers. 
However, the different types of ceils in a tissue presumably 
retain their individuality as a result of the lack of cell-cell 
transfer of macromolecules, such as enzymes, DNA, RNA, 
etc. 
This type of communication occurs through a specific type 
of cell surface membrane specialization, known as a gap 
junction (Revel and Karnovsky, 1967; Gilula et al., 1972). 
Gap junctions are characterized by two adjoining plasma 
membranes separated by a 2-3-nm space or ""gap"" (as viewed 
in thin sections) and normally exist as a polygonal lattice of 
8.5-nm subunits (Makowski et al., 1977; Unwin and Zam- 
pighi, 1980). 
In excitable tissues, such as the mammalian myocardium 
and various electrotonically coupled neurons, gap junctions 
provide the basis for the rapid propagation of electrical sig- 
nals between cells. Gap junctional pathways, referred to as 
electrical synapses, provide the fundamental mechanism for 
synchronizing cells into a functional syncytium (Weidmann, 
1952). A large body of evidence shows that gap junctional 
communication exists in most non-excitable tissues as well. 
However, little is known, although a great deal has been 
postulated, regarding the functional role of gap junctions in 
non-excitable tissues. Recently, it has been demonstrated that 
a selective disruption of gap junctional communication can 
have a substantial effect on embryonic development (Warner 
et al., 1984). 
Gap junctions have been isolated from mammalian liver by 
treating plasma membrane fractions with detergents or alkali 
in conjunction with subcellular fractionation procedures 
(Goodenough and Stoeckenius, 1972; Hertzberg and Gilula, 
1979; Henderson et al., 1979; Hertzberg, 1984). The junc- 
tions are isolated on the basis of their unusual insolubility. 
Morphologically, the isolated gap junctions are similar to 
those present in vivo. There is now general agreement that 
the isolated liver gap junction contains a single, major poly- 
peptide with an apparent Mr of ,~27,000 (Hertzberg and 
Gilula, 1979; Henderson et al., 1979; Finbow et al., 1980). 
However, other polypeptides have been reported to be pres- 
ent in isolated gap junctions; these include proteins of Mr 
16,000 (Finbow et al., 1983) and 33,000 (Ehrhart and Chau- 
veau, 1977). 
On the basis of comparative biochemical and immuno- 
chemical studies, it is possible to conclude that some homol- 
ogy exists between the rat liver Mr 27,000 junction protein 
and junctional proteins present in other tissues and organ- 
isms (Hertzberg and Skibbens, 1984; Warner et al., 1984; 
Dermietzel et al., 1984; Zervos et al., 1985). However, the 
relationship between junction proteins from heart and liver 
is controversial (Gros et al., 1983; Hertzberg and Skibbens, 
1984; Zervos et al., 1985; Nicholson et al., 1985). Also, it 
is now clear that there is no detectable molecular homology 
between the rat liver Mr 27,000 junction protein and the ma- 
jor tissue-specific junction protein (MP26) found in the eye 
lens fiber (Hertzberg et al., 1982; Nicholson et al., 1983). 
The existence of molecular homology between junction 
proteins from different organisms and cell types has also 
been strongly indicated in some biological studies (Michalke 
and Loewenstein, 1971; Epstein and Gilula, 1977). When 
cells from different organs and different vertebrate species 
are paired in culture, they frequently communicate (Epstein 
and Gilula, 1977). This property of gap junctional expression

suggests that gap junctional polypeptides are similar in 
different cells. For example, when mouse myocardial cells 
and rat ovarian cells are co-cultured, they readily establish 
junctional communication pathways (Lawrence et al., 1978). 
Also, antibodies to the rat liver Mr 27,000 gap junction pro- 
tein are effective in blocking communication in amphibian 
embryonic cells (Warner et al., 1984), as well as in other 
mammalian cell types (Hertzberg et al., 1985). 
Since gap junctions are a low abundance component of the 
cell surface membrane, progress in the biochemical analysis 
of these structures has been difficult. Nonetheless, some 
microsequence information (for '~50 residues from the 
NH2-terminus) has been obtained (Nicholson et al., 1981). 
This information has been useful for comparison with other 
potentially related proteins (Nicholson et al., 1983), and for 
providing an approach for identification of a gap junction 
eDNA. A recombinant eDNA probe for gap junction 
mRNAs would be most useful for identifying the gap junc- 
tional component(s) in the liver and other tissues, and for the 
study of junction biosynthesis, function, and regulation. The 
cloning and characterization of two such eDNA probes, one 
from human liver and one from rat liver, is described below. 
Materials and Methods 
Materials 
All radiochemicals were purchased from Amersham Corp. (Arlington 
Heights, IL). Restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mann- 
heim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), Amersham Corp., or International 
Biotechnologies, Inc. (New Haven, CT). T4 polynucleotide kinase, nucleo- 
tides, and M13mpl9 vector DNA were purchased from Pharmacia Molecu- 
lar Biology Die., Pharmacia, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). DNA polymerase I 
(Klenow fragment) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, 
MA). Chemicals were obtained either from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, 
NJ) or from Matheson, Coleman, and Bell (Cincinnati, OH). Urea was pur- 
chased from Schwartz/Mann Biotech (Cambridge, MA). 
Oligonucleotide Synthesis 
DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized with either a Beckman System 1 
Plus or Applied Biosystems Model 380A synthesizer. The oligonucleotides 
were purified by PAGE in 7 M urea (Lo et al., 1984). 
Labeling of Oligonucleotide Probes 
For screening eDNA libraries, the 58-mer oligonucleotide was end-labeled 
with [y-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Maniatis et al., 1982). 
Screening cDNA Libraries 
An adult human liver eDNA library constructed in ~,gtll was kindly 
provided by Savio L. C. Woo, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 
(Kwok et al., 1985). 150000 plaques propagated in Escherichia coli Y1090 
were transferred to replica nylon membranes (Biotrans A; ICN Radiochemi- 
cal, Irvine, CA), processed, and baked at 80°C for2 h as described (Mania- 
tis et al., 1982). Baked filters were prehybridized, and then hybridized to 
32p end-labeled 58-mer oligonucleotide probe as described (Ullrich et al., 
1984). Filters were washed three times (20 min each) and autoradiographed 
at -70°C with Kodak XAR-5 film and a DuPont intensifying screen. One 
clone was identified that gave a signal on duplicate filters. This clone was 
plaque purified and the resulting eDNA insert subcloned into Ml3mpl9 
phage vector using standard techniques (Maniatis et al., 1982). 
The eDNA selected initially by the 58-mer oligonucleotide was used sub- 
sequenily to screen another aliquot of the same human liver eDNA library 
and, in addition, a rat liver eDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Ap- 
proximately 150,000 plaques were screened from each library. The human 
liver eDNA insert was isolated from low melt agarose and oligo-labeled as 
described below. Hybridization with the labeled eDNA was carried out in 
50% formamide, 5x SSPE, (1× SSPE is 0.18 M NaC1, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 
pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA), 5× Denhardt's (lx Denhardt's is 0.02% Ficoll, 
0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% BSA), 100 gg/ml yeast RNA per ml at 
42""C for 15 h. Upon completion of hybridization, the filters were washed 
once (20 min) at room temperature in lx SSC (lx SSC is 0.15 M NaCI, 
0.015 M Na citrate, pH 7.0) followed by two washes at 65°C with lx SSC. 
Positive clones were plaque purified, the size of the insert determined, and 
the phages containing the longest insert subcloned in the M13mp19 vector. 
DNA Sequencing 
Eco Rl-digested DNA isolated from positive plaques were subcloned into 
Ml3mpl9 using standard techniques (Maniatis et al., 1982). The procedure 
of Dale et al. (1985) was used to produce a series of overlapping deletions 
that were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Biggins et 
al., 1983). Instead of using an M13 sequencing primer, some regions were 
sequenced using synthetic oligonucleotides prepared against previously se- 
quenced regions as primers for the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 
I. Both strands of the inserts were completely sequenced. 
Oligo-Labeling of cDNA 
Eco Rl-digested phage DNA containing the human liver gap junction 
eDNA was separated on tow-melt agarose (IBI) and the eDNA insert iso- 
lated as described (Langridge et al., 1980). The resulting eDNA was labeled 
with 32P-dCTP to a specific activity of ,o2 x 109 cprn/~tg using random 
hexanucleotides as primers as described (Feinberg and Vngeistein, 1984). 
RNA Isolation, Blotting, and Hybridization 
RNA was isolated from biopsied human liver using a LiCl-urea procedure 
(Auffray and Rougeon, 1980) as modified by Mohun et al. (1984). Poly A(+) 
RNA was isolated using oligo dT cellulose by a batch procedure (Maniatis 
et al., 1982). 
RNA electrophoresis was carried out using glyoxal as a denaturant as de- 
scribed (Thomas, 1980). RNA in the gel was transferred to Hybond N 
(Amersham Corp.) by capillary blotting, and baked at 80°C for 2 h. 
Hybridization of `ol × 106 cpm/ml 32p-labeled human liver eDNA was 
performed as described (Thomas, 1980) at 42°C for 15 h in 50% forma- 
mide, 5x SSPE, 5× Denhardt's, 100 ~tg/ml yeast RNA. After hybridiza- 
tion, filters were washed once with Ix SSC at room temperature followed 
by two washes of 0.2x SSC at 65°C before exposure at -70""C to Kodak 
XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen. Each wash was for 20 rain. 
Isolation, Blotting, and Hybridization 
of Genomic DNA 
High molecular weight DNA was isolated from human liver, rat liver, and 
Xenopus liver essentially as described (Maniatis et al., 1982). DNA from 
baboon, chicken, and rabbit liver was obtained from Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai, 
Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, DNA was digested with differ- 
ent restriction enzymes, the fragments were separated on an agarose gel and 
capillary blotted to Magna Nylon 66 (Micron Seperations, Inc., NY) (Mani- 
atis et al., 1982). After baking, the filter was prebybridized in 50% forma- 
rnide, 5× SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's, 100 gg/rni yeast RNA for 3 h at 42°C. Hy- 
bridization of a 3eP-labeled EcoR1 fragment of the initially isolated human 
liver gap junction eDNA was carried out in the same buffer at 42°C for 15 
h. After hybridization, the filter was washed with lx SSC at room tempera- 
ture, and then three times with 1× SSC at 60°C. Each wash was for 20 rain. 
Immunoblotting 
Liver samples were homogenized in an SDS containing gel buffer, cen- 
trifuged for 5 rain in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant loaded on a 
12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel as described (Warner et al., 1984). Isolated 
rat liver gap junctions were prepared as described (Hertzberg, 1984). Trans- 
fer to nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH) was car- 
fled out as described (Towbin et al., 1979). Blots were incubated with either 
affinity-purified preimmune immunoglobulin or affinity-purified immuno- 
globulin that recognized the gap junction protein at a 1:250 dilution essen- 
tially as described (Warner et al., 1984). The specifically bound antibodies 
were detected using 125I-donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.). Prep- 
aration and characterization of the affinity-purified gap junction antibody 
has been described previously (Warner et al., 1984). 
In Vitro Transcription and Translation 
The Eco R1 fragment from the lambda phage containing the human liver 
The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 103, 1986 
768 
gap junction eDNA was inserted into the polylinker site of the pGEM-1 vec- 
tor (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI) by standard procedures (Maniatis et al., 
1982). Coding (sense) RNA was synthesized by cleaving the vector with 
Pvu II and performing in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase 
(Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to Melton et al. 
(1984), as modified for addition of 7m GpppG to the 5' end of RNA 
(Konarska et al., 1984). Similarly, antisense RNA was transcribed with T7 
RNA polymerase (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) 
from Hind IH-cleaved pGEM-I vector containing the gap junction eDNA. 
No Hind IlI or Pvu II sites occur in the eDNA. 
In vitro translation of the RNA was performed in a commercially avail- 
able rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Bethesda Research Laboratories) according 
to supplier-suggested conditions using [35Slmethionine. 
Translation was termina~:l by addition of SDS containing gel loading 
buffer. SDS gel electrophoresis of the in vitro translation products was per- 
formed in t2.5% polyacrylarnide running gels with 4% polyacrylamide 
stacking gels as described (Dreyfuss et al., 1984). Gels were prepared for 
autoradiography by treatment with EN3HANCE (New England Nuclear, 
Boston, MA) or Amplify (Amersham Corp.) using protocols suggested by 
the manufacturers. Gels were subsequently dried and exposed at -70°C to 
Kodak XAR-5 film. 
Results 
A human liver eDNA library was screened with a partially 
degenerate 58 base synthetic oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 1). 
The sequence of the oligonucleotide corresponded to amino 
acid residues 13 to 32 that were previously identified 
(Nicholson et al., 1981). In synthesizing the oligonucleotide, 
a choice of codons for the different amino acids was made 
according to codon usage frequencies in mammalian genes 
(Grantham et al., 1981). The oligonucleotide was synthe- 
sized to be complementary (antisense) to the coding (RNA) 
strand. 
A single positive signal on duplicate filters was obtained 
by screening 150,000 plaques of a human liver eDNA library 
with the 32p-labeled 58-mer. This plaque was purified to ho- 
mogeneity and subcloned in both orientations into M13mpl9 
for sequence analysis. The nucleotide sequence, together 
with the deduced amino acid sequence of this eDNA is 
shown in Fig. 2. The cDNA was 1,574 bases long, including 
16 adenylic acid residues at the 3' end. The homology be- 
tween the 58-mer oligonucleotide and the actual eDNA se- 
quence was 81%. This indicates that the specificity of the 
probe was not compromised by the occasional incorrect 
choice of codons. 
The deduced amino acid sequence appears to code for a 
32,022-D protein. The assignment of a translation reading 
frame to the nucleotide sequence was based on both a pub- 
lished amino-terminal sequence of the rat liver gap junction 
protein (Nicholson et al., 1981) and an internal amino acid 
sequence that was determined in this laboratory (Zimmer, 
D. B., W. H. Evans, and N. B. Gilula, manuscript submitted 
for publication). The regions of sequence underlined in Fig. 
2 indicate the actual residues that have been determined for 
the isolated rat liver gap junction protein. 
There was perfect agreement between the deduced human 
protein sequence and the experimentally determined amino 
acid sequence of rat liver gap junctions. The amino acid 
composition calculated from the sequence data corre- 
sponded well to the experimentally determined values as 
shown in Table I. This provided further support for the 
deduced amino acid sequence being the actual sequence of 
the liver gap junction protein. 
Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated 
that the NH2-terminal half of the gap junction protein con- 
tained a predominance of hydrophobic amino acids, where- 
as the COOH-terminal half contained many charged and 
hydrophilic amino acids. The sequence Asn-Trp-Thr begin- 
ning at amino acid 2 was a potential glycosylation site since 
it matched exactly the consensus sequence, Asn-X-Thr/Ser, 
that has been derived for attachment of N-linked carbohy- 
drate structures (Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981). 
The cAMP-dependent protein kinases have a strong prefer- 
ence for serines and threonines that are located 2 residues 
to the COOH-terminal side of two basic amino acids (Krebs 
and Beavo, 1979). Two such potential cAMP-dependent 
phosphorylation sites were present in the gap junction se- 
quence at positions 233 and 240. 
Tyrosine phosphorylation may require the presence of a 
basic amino acid residue that is 7 residues on the NH2- 
terminal side of the target tyrosine, together with one or 
more acidic residues between 1 and 6 residues away (Pat- 
schinsky et al., 1982). Several of the tyrosine residues (posi- 
tions 151, 171, 243) of the human gap junction sequence ex- 
hibited this general feature. 
The presence of a termination codon just upstream from 
the amino-terminal end of the protein indicated that a cleaved 
signal sequence is likely to be absent. An optimal consensus 
sequence for translational initiation has been described (Ko- 
zak, 1984). The GCAGGATGA found in the eDNA clone 
around the putative methionine initiation codon is not in 
good agreement with this consensus sequence. However, the 
eDNA does contain a purine in position -3 (3 nucleotides 
upstream of the initiation codon) which has been recently

Figure 1. Amino acid sequence of selected region of the rat liver gap junction protein and corresponding 58-mer oligonucleotide sequence. 
A selected region of the known amino acid sequence of the rat liver gap junction protein is shown (Nicholson et al., 1981). The possible 
codon choices for the different amino acids appear underneath the protein sequence. Also shown is the sequence of the 58-base-long 
oligonucleotide that was complementary to the coding sequence, and was used as a probe for the isolation of the human liver junction 
cDNA clone. The RNA sequence shown was subsequently derived from this clone, s = c,g; v = a,c; r = a,t; q = c,t; y = a,c,t; n = a,g,c,t.

The mole percent of each amino acid was calculated from the derived amino 
acid sequence. The experimental values for the gap junction protein are from 
(a) deduced protein sequence from human liver gap junction eDNA; (b) Hen- 
derson et al., 1979; and (c) Nicholson et al., 1983. ND, not determined. 
shown to have a dominant effect on selection of the functional 
initiation codon (Kozak, 1986). 
A precise fit to the polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, did 
not exist in the sequence of the eDNA. However, a close 
homologue, ATTAAA, was present 21 nucleotides upstream 
of the polyadenylation site; this may be responsible for 
directing cleavage and/or polyadenylation of the RNA. 
Characterization of Gap Junction RNA 
Poly A(+) RNA was isolated from human, mouse, and rat 
livers and subjected to blot hybridization using the 1.57-kb 
human liver eDNA as a probe (Fig. 3). A single major RNA 
species of ,~1,600 bases was detected. Other minor bands of 
faster mobility were also detected. These may represent 
degradation products in the RNA sample. 
The size of the RNA is consistent with the gap junction 
eDNA clone containing most, if not all, of the nucleotide se- 
quence of a gap junction RNA, including the nontranslating 
regions. 
Analysis of Genomic DNA 
Total genomic DNA was isolated from the livers of human, 
baboon, rabbit, rat, chicken, and Xenopus laevis. After 
digestion with restriction enzymes, the fragments were ex- 
amined by Southern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, in the 
human, rabbit, baboon, and Xenopus DNA samples digested 
with Eco RI, a single intense band of varying sizes was de- 
tected. This suggests that the gap junction gene may be pres- 
ent as only one copy per haploid genome. 
Figure 3. RNA blot analysis. 5 
[tg of poly A(+) RNA from 
human (lane I), rat 0ane 2), 
and mouse 0ane 3) livers was 
treated with glyoxal, sepa- 
rated on a 1.2 % agarose gel, 
and transferred to Hybond N 
(Thomas, 1980). After pre- 
hybridization, 32P-labeled hu- 
man gap junction eDNA was 
hybridized to the blot. Condi- 
tions for hybridization were 
50% formamide, 5x SSPE, 
5x Denhardt's, 100 ~tg/ml 
yeast RNA at 42°C for 15 h, 
and the final wash was 0.2x 
SSC at 65°C. The size of the 
gap junction RNA band was 
estimated from RNA stan- 
dards 
(Bethesda Research 
Laboratories, 
Gaithersburg, 
MD) run in adjacent lanes. 
Lines on the left-hand side in- 
dicate mobility of 18 S (lower 
mark) and 28 S (upper mark) 
ribosomal RNA standards. 
Four fragments were detected upon hybridization of the 
gap junction eDNA probe to human DNA digested with Pst 
I. This indicated that a minimun of 3 Pst I sites exist in the 
gap junction gene. The restriction map of the eDNA indi- 
cated only two last I sites exist in the sequence. Thus; this 
is indicative, but not proof, that at least one intron is present 
in the gap junction gene, and that it contains a last I site. 
Immunoblot Analysis of Gap Junction Protein 
The molecular mass of the protein in isolated gap junctions 
is generally agreed to be 27,000 D as estimated by SDS poly- 
acrylamide gels. The tissue that has been most commonly 
used for the isolation of gap junctions is liver from either 
mice or rats. The sequence of the human liver gap junction 
cDNA presented above suggests that the human liver gap 
junction protein has a calculated molecular mass of 32,022 
D. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the 
human junction protein is slightly larger than the rat or 
mouse junction proteins. This possibility was examined by 
an immunoblot analysis shown in Fig. 5. Tissue homogenates 
were prepared from frozen rat and human liver, the proteins 
separated on an SDS polyacrylamide gel, transferred to 
nitrocellulose and probed with either gap junction-specific 
antibodies or preimmune antibodies. As can be observed in 
Fig. 5, both the human and rat contained a protein of 27,000 
D that was recognized by the gap junction antibodies. This 
band co-migrated with the major 27,000-D protein that exists 
in the isolated rat liver gap junction preparation. The lower 
bands observed in the human liver homogenate probably 
reflect some degradation of the sample during its prepara- 
tion. No binding was observed with the afffinity-purified 
preimmune antibodies.

preimmune antibodies (B, lane 4) as described in Materials and 
Methods. Specifically bound antibodies were detected using lzsI-

standards shown on left were BSA (66 kD), catalase (57.5 kD), 
ovalbumin (45 kD), and trypsin inhibitor (20 kD). The arrow at the 
left indicates the position of the 27-kD junction protein. 
In Vitro Transcription and Translation 
Another possibility for the difference between the protein 
size determined using isolated gap junctions and the size 
predicted from the eDNA sequence is that some posttransla- 
tional processing may occur in vivo to produce a 27,000-D 
protein from a 32,022-D protein. To test this possibility, the 
human gap junction eDNA was subcloned into an SP6/T7 
RNA polymerase vector, pGEM-1. The insert in this vector 
was oriented so that in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA 
polymerase produced a coding strand of RNA, whereas T7 
RNA polymerase produced the opposite strand. The in 
vitro-synthesized transcripts were translated in a reticulo- 
cyte lysate system and the resulting products analyzed by 
SDS PAGE. Shown in Fig. 6 are the products of two different 
translations of in vitro-synthesized coding RNA. In one 
case, a major product of 32,000-D with minor bands at 
26,000, 24,500, and 16,500 D, was observed. In the other 
case, a major product of 27,000 D was observed. This band 
was similar in mobility to the 27,000-D band from purified 
gap junctions. The same batch of reticulocyte lysate was used 
in all experiments. However, translations were carried out 
using different preparations of synthetic RNA. This experi- 
ment has been repeated a number of times and the only major 
products that have been detected were of 32,000 and 27,000 
D. It is not clear why the two different products have been 
observed upon translation; however, the differences may be 
a reflection of the translational efficiency of the different 
preparations of in vitro-synthesized RNA. No translation 
products were observed using the noncoding strand (an- 
tisense) RNA synthesized from the T7 RNA polymerase pro- 
moter. 
Comparison of Human Liver Gap Junction 
with Rat Gap Junction 
An aliquot of the human liver eDNA library was rescreened 
using the original eDNA as a probe in order to confirm the 
DNA sequence of the human liver eDNA. A number of posi- 
tive colonies were identified, one of which was purified to 
homogeneity and subcloned into M13mpl9. The sequence of 
this clone was identical to the original clone, except it con- 
tained 21 adenylic acid residues at the 3' end (compared to 
16 adenylic acid residues in the original clone) and, in addi- 
tion, it was one base shorter at the 5' end. This suggested an 
independent origin for this clone and provided support for 
the sequence shown in Fig. 2. 
To determine the sequence variation of the gap junction 
gene, a rat liver eDNA library was also screened with the 
original human eDNA insert. A single positive plaque was 
identified from screening 150,000 plaques of a rat liver 
eDNA library, and it was subsequently subcloned into 
M13mpl9. The sequence of the rat liver eDNA and its com- 
parison to the human liver eDNA is shown in Fig. 7. The rat 
liver gap junction eDNA was 1,127 bases long, beginning at 
base 401 of the human liver eDNA and ending with a 10- 
base-long poly (A) tail at the 3' end.

cated excellent homology between the COOH-terminal half 
of the rat liver and human liver gap junction protein se- 
quence. Only 4 amino acid changes at positions 169, 170, 171,

ing the Eco R1 fragment of the human liver gap junction cDNA and

Methods. Lane 1 is the translation profile observed with addition 
of no exogenous RNA to the translation mix. Lane 2 is the transla- 
tion profile observed with rat liver poly A(+) RNA (0.5 ixg/transla- 
tion). Lanes 4 and 6contain translation products of different batches 
of coding RNA (2 I~g/translation) synthesized using SP6 RNA poly- 
merase on Pvu II cut eDNA containing vector. Lanes 3 and 5 con- 
tain translation products of antisense RNA (2 Ixg/translation) syn- 
thesized using T7 RNA polymerase. On the left of the figure, 
molecular mass standards are indicated (in kilodaltons) and the

and 184 (Asp, Val, Tyr, Pro in the human sequence and Glu, 
Ala, Phe, Ser in the rat sequence) of the human sequence ap- 
peared to be different in the two species. Apart from the 
change of proline to serine, these changes are conservative 
and unlikely to have a significant influence on gap junction 
structure. 
At the DNA level, there was good, but not perfect, homol- 
ogy between the human and rat liver gap junction eDNA se- 
quences. In the coding region of the cDNA sequence, the 
variation that was found was generally in the third position 
of a codon. This was consistent with the deduced protein se- 
quence since such ""wobbles"" in the codons at the third posi- 
tion do not lead to variation in the protein sequence due to 
degeneracy in the genetic code. 
In contrast, the 3' nontranslating region had a large num- 
ber of DNA sequence changes which include both additions 
and deletions of DNA sequence blocks, as well as base 
changes. Interestingly, the size of the 3' nontranslating region 
in both human and rat sequences was approximately the 
same, even though addition and deletion of DNA sequences 
have occurred between the two species. 
Discussion 
The results presented in this study indicate that a full length 
eDNA coding for a human liver gap junction protein has 
been identified and characterized. This clone contains most, 
if not all, of the sequence for a gap junction RNA since there 
is a close similarity in the size of the gap junction RNA, as 
determined by Northern blot analysis, and the length of the 
eDNA, as determined by sequence analysis. Further proof 
of the full-length nature of the clone wiU require the isolation 
and characterization of genomic clones. The excellent agree- 
ment between the deduced protein sequence and the actual 
partial amino acid sequence derived from isolated rat liver 
gap junctions indicates that the cDNA does code for a gap 
junction protein. Consistent with this is the good agreement 
between amino acid composition of the isolated gap junc- 
tions and the predicted sequence. 
The NH2-terminal half of the deduced protein sequence 
is extremely hydrophobic, whereas the COOH-terminal half 
has many charged residues. This suggests that the NHz- 
terminal half probably contains membrane-spanning do- 
mains, whereas the COOH-terminal portion is exposed to an 
aqueous environment. This is consistent with the proteolytic 
data obtained using isolated gap junctions (Zimmer, D. B., 
W. H. Evans, and N. B. Gilula, manuscript submitted for 
publication). 
The molecular mass of the major protein present in iso- 
lated gap junctions has been estimated to be ,~27,000-28,000 
D (Henderson et al., 1979; Hertzberg and Gilula, 1979). The 
molecular mass of the gap junction deduced from the cDNA 
sequence is 32,022 D. The reason for this discrepancy is not 
known, but the following explanations can be offered: (a) 
DNA sequencing error; (b) differences in gap junction pro- 
tein size between species; (c) proteolysis of gap junction pro- 
tein posttranslationally or during isolation and characteriza- 
tion; and (d) anomolous migration of gap junction protein 
on SDS polyacrylamide gels. The first explanation is un- 
likely since two independently isolated clones have been se- 
quenced, and they have identical sequences. Furthermore, a 
partial gap junction cDNA from a rat liver cDNA library 
also has almost perfect sequence homology with the human 
liver gap junction protein. The homology at the DNA level 
is almost perfect up to the end of the protein-coding sequence 
with variations generally occurring in the third position of 
a codon. However, in the 3' nontranslating region, there is 
less homology with base substitution, addition and dele- 
tions, occurring in the two sequences. This is consistent with 
the proposed reading frame since it would be expected that 
the nontranslating region can vary appreciably during evolu- 
tion without affecting the function of the protein. 
The immunoblot analysis of rat and human liver gap junc- 
tion suggests a common antigenic determinant between the 
two species. Furthermore, the similar molecular mass of the 
gap junction protein from the two species is consistent with 
there being considerable homology between rat and human 
liver gap junctions, which indicates that the second explana- 
tion is unlikely. 
The most likely explanations for the discrepancy between 
the predicted and experimentally determined molecular 
masses of the gap junction protein are proteolysis or anam- 
olous behavior of the protein on SDS polyacrylamide gels.

cell-free translation indicates that the eDNA can code for a 
32,000-D protein, although occasionally, a 27,000-D protein 
is also observed. The reason for this variation is not known, 
although it is currently being studied. One possibility is that 
an endogenous protease in the retieulocyte lysate can, under 
certain conditions, digest in vitro-synthesized gap junctions. 
Failure to detect a 32,000-D protein in vivo could also result 
from a similar biologically relevant posttranslational pro- 
cessing event that occurs in vivo. Nonetheless, the detection 
of a 32,000-D translation product is consistent with the 
predicted size of the protein based on the eDNA sequence. 
It is interesting to note that other polypeptides of different 
molecular masses have been proposed as components of gap 
junctions. Of particular relevance is a 34,000-D protein that 
appears to have a similar proteolytic map to the 27,000-D 
protein commonly reported (Finbow et al., 1980), and a 
54,000-D species that has some antigenic homology to the 
27,000-D protein (Warner et al., 1984; Paul, 1985). 
The detection of bands upon hybridization of the human 
gap junction probe to genomic DNA from various species 
suggests that at least some portions of the gap junction gene 
sequence have been conserved at least down to Xenopus on 
the evolutionary scale. Such conservation would be consis- 
tent with the reported antigenic homology between rat and 
Xenopus junction proteins (Warner et al., 1984). 
Gap junction conductance can be regulated by a variety of 
agents including H ÷, Ca ++, and cAMP. The mechanism by 
which these agents act to regulate communication is not 
known. One attractive hypothesis, at least for cAMP, in- 
volves phosphorylation of gap junctions by a cAMP-depen- 
dent protein kinase. Addition of a subunit of a cAMP-depen- 
dent protein kinase to certain communication-defective cells 
in culture has been shown to increase the junctional permea- 
bility of these cells (Wiener and Loewenstein, 1983). There 
has been a report indicating that the junction protein can be 
phosphorylated in hepatocyte cultures (Saez et al., 1986). 
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a tyrosine phos- 
phorylating protein kinase, the ppt0 'r~ protein, can de- 
crease junctional permeability (Atldnson et al., 1981; Azar- 
nia and Loewenstein, 1984). Therefore, it is of interest to 
note that the gap junction sequence contains potential cAMP- 
dependent phosphorylation sites and tyrosine phosphoryla- 
tion sites. These sites are localized in the COOH-terminal 
domain of the gap junction protein which is a region of the 
protein that is exposed to the cytoplasm (Zimmer, D. B., 
W. H. Evans, and N. B. Gilula, manuscript submitted for 
publication). Further experimentation will be necessary to 
determine whether these specific sites are phosphorylated in 
vivo and if they are of biological significance. 
The results of this initial analysis provide conclusive evi- 
dence for the existence of a 1,574-base transcript that codes 
for a gap junction protein of 32,022 D. Since this coding se- 
quence matches perfectly with the limited sequence available 
for the endogenous 27,000-D protein in isolated gap junc- 
tions, it is possible that the 27,000-D component could be de- 
rived from the 32,022-D component by direct proteolytic 
treatment of the COOH-terminal domain. However, more in- 
formation will be required from genomic cloning and in vitro 
translation before it will be possible to understand the precise 
relationship between the primary transcript of the gap junc- 
tion gene and the 27,000-D protein that exists in the isolated 
gap junctions. Thus far, preliminary RNA hybridization 
results have indicated that multiple transcripts with consider- 
able size variation can be detected in RNA from different or- 
ganisms (vertebrate and invertebrate) with the human liver 
cDNA probe. Therefore, it may be possible that the gap junc- 
tion gene can produce multiple transcripts, each of which 
may code for a specific gap junction protein. Such diversity 
may account for the homologies and differences that have 
been reported (Warner et al., 1984; Dermietzel et al., 1984; 
Hertzberg and Skibbens, 1984; Paul, 1985; Nicholson et al., 
1985).

Note Added in Proof.. After submission of this manuscript, a paper by D. 
Paul describing the cloning and characterization of a rat liver gap junction 
eDNA appeared in The Journal of CeU Biology (103:123-134, 1986). A eom- 
purison of the sequence indicates that our rat gap junction eDNA nucleotide 
sequence is a partial eDNA corresponding to nueleotide positions 370--148 
in the sequence of D. Paul. With the exception of one nueleotide at position 
1212 of our sequence (a change of a T to a C in the two sequences), the se- 
quences are identical. This nuelootide change results in a difference in 
amino acid sequence (Set in our sequence, Pro in D. Paul sequence). The 
significance of this ehanga is not known. It may represent a polymorphism 
in the gene especially since the human gap junction eDNA also codes for 
a Pro at this position.

Summary
This 4 year study reports on a pharmacokinetic study for the widely used regimen of cis-platin
plus continuous 5-day 5-FU as first-line chemotherapy of head and neck cancer, and the benefit of such data
for real-time therapy management. Pharmacokinetic analysis of 177 cycles for 77 patients from a group of 89
patients (group
1; 228 cycles) revealed that both the time-concentration product (AUC) for the entire cycle
and the half-cycle AUC (AUCO3days)
were predictive of cycle toxicity. Real-time analysis of individual
AUCO-3 days was used to decide whether to reduce the dose during the second half of the cycle for a total of
249 cycles (81 patients; group 2). The dose in the second half of the course was reduced in 40% of the group 2
courses. There was a statistical difference in complete response rates between group 1 (31%) and group 2
(47%), (0.02<P<0.05) and a statistically significant reduction was observed in the incidence of toxic cycles
(>grade
2,
group 1= 20%
versus
group 2 = 12.4%; 0.02 <P <0.05). Pharmacokinetic follow-up
of these
patients has proved to be an objective means to improve therapeutic index significantly.
In addition to the digestive tract, where its efficacy remains
limited (Buroker et al., 1985), chemotherapy by 5-FU is used
for other disease sites. In squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck very high response rates have been observed
when
the
drug
is
combined
with
cisplatin
(CDDP)
(Thyss et al., 1986b; Amrein & Weitzman, 1985; Kish et al.,
1982).
This
combination
protocol
is
accompanied
by
a
significant incidence of toxicity (Amrein & Weitzman, 1985)
that is often acceptable but sometimes severe, depending on
the dose (Merlano et al., 1987) or the specific site (Kies et
al., 1987).
One of the major objectives of clinical pharmacokinetics is
to improve the therapeutic index on an individual patient
basis. For a limited population of head and neck carcinoma
patients treated by CDDP-5-FU, we previously showed that
the
digestive
tract
and/or
haematological
tolerance
was
linked to the degree of total body exposure to the drug
during the cycle (C xT, area under curve, AUC) (Thyss et
al., 1986a).
The first part of the present study extends and confirms
this result on a larger population. In the second stage, data
obtained were used for a prospective study in an attempt to
improve the therapeutic index.
Subjects and methods
Study population
A total of 170 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck treated at our institution between 1983 and
1987 were investigated. There were 145 men and 25 women,
mean age 61 years (range 36-82). A total of 477 chemo-
therapy cycles were analysed.
Group
1 (89 patients, 228 cycles) corresponds to a retro-
spective study during which 5-FU blood concentrations were
measured
systematically
for each
individual
cycle
of 77
patients
(177
cycles).
This
group
of
patients
allowed
comparison of the distribution of AUC values as a function
of
response
and
tolerance
to
treatment.
Group
2
(81
patients, 249 cycles) corresponds to patients entered into a
prospective study based on the conclusions of the initial data
obtained for group 1.

Chemotherapy regimen
Treatment was as follows. Day 0, 6h hydration with 5%
dextrose (2 litres), NaCl (6gl-1), and KCI (3gl-1), followed
by CDDP (100mgm-2)
1 mgmin-1
i.v.
in normal saline
(0.5 litres) with 1.6% mannitol (0.25 litres), and then 5%
dextrose (1 litre), NaCl (6gI-1) and KCI (3g -1). Days 1-5,
5-FU 1,000 mg m- 2 24 h 1 by continuous i.v. infusion with a
controlled flow pump. The scheduled protocol called for
three courses per patient every three weeks.
Evaluation of response and toxicity
Response was evaluated by the same physician 10 days after
completion
of
the
last
chemotherapy
course.
Clinical
response was defined using the product of two perpendicular
lesion diameters. Complete response (CR) corresponded to
disappearance of all clinically visible or palpable lesions;
partial response (PR) was defined as tumour regression of
over
50%;
no
response
(NR)
corresponded
to
tumour
regression of 50%
or
less,
stable
disease
or progressive
disease.
For
the
patients who
underwent
surgery
after
chemotherapy, the histological response was evaluated by
examining
the
surgical
specimen.
Haematological
and
digestive tract toxicities were evaluated using WHO criteria.
Only haematological and digestive tract toxicities, including
stomatitis,
were
considered
because
they
are
the
most
frequent for this protocol and necessitate dose reduction and
treatment interruption. Other toxicities are rare, e.g. cardiac
toxicity (Thyss et al., 1987) and neurological toxicity (Weiss
et al., 1974), or without therapeutic consequences (alopoecia,
cutaneous toxicity).
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Two blood samples were collected every day (8 a.m., 5 p.m.)
during each 5-FU course. Venous blood (5 ml) was drawn on
EDTA tubes and samples were immediately brought to the
laboratory and centrifuged (Omin, 2,500 r.p.m.). Plasma was
stored at -200C until analysed (within 1-3 days). For group
2, the tubes corresponding to the first two days of 5-FU
administration and the tube obtained at 8a.m. on the third
day (first half of the 5-FU cycle) were all analysed on the
morning of the third day to determine the half-cycle AUC
(AUCO-3 days) and thus modify or not the second half-cycle
5-FU
dose.
A
previously
described
HPLC
technique
(Christophidis et al., 1979) was used for 5-FU measurements.
The limit of sensitivity was
5 ng ml-
. AUC (product of
concentration per time, area under curve) was calculated by

the
trapezoidal
rule
using
an
appropriate
programme.
AUCO.3days was calculated from 0 to 48h of the 5-FU cycle
(8 a.m.
on
the
third day
of the
cycle) and AUCO5days
was determined from 0 to 105 h (5p.m. on the fifth day of
the cycle).
Statistics
Comparisons of distribution of AUC values were made using
Student's
t test. Threshold values were tested using the x2
test. The comparison for tumour stage repartition, response
and toxicity between groups
1 and 2 was made using the x2
test.
Results
Figure
1 shows the respective distribution of individual 5-FU
AUC values for all group
1 courses with respect to toxic and
non-toxic courses. Comparisons were made for total course
AUC (AUCO, 5 days) and first half-course AUC (AUCO3 days)
Although
there
was
some
overlap
in
the
data,
the
distributions were significantly different between toxic and
non-toxic
courses.
Median
values
were
respectively
(ng ml-1h-) for non-toxic cycles: 5,500 (AUCO3 days) and
26,000 (AUCO5 days) and for toxic cycles: 11,000 (AUCO3 days)
and
34,000
(AUCOsdays).
We
identified
a
threshold
AUCO-3days value of 15,000ngml-Ph-1
that predicted cycle
toxicity (X2=39.8, P<0.001).
Table I shows the mean AUC values for the first half of
the cycle for group
1
patients
as
a function of tumoral
response. Mean values were lowest for non-responders (NR)
and highest for complete responders (CR), but differences
were not statistically significant because of the great degree
of variability.
It was decided to
use AUCO3 days data to
establish a diagram (Figure 2) for treatment monitoring in a
prospective study group, group 2 (see Appendix 1). For all
patients and all cycles of group 2 the AUCD3 days value was
used to determine the extent of reduction (if required) of the
5-FU dose for the second half of the cycle.
Table
II
shows
the
respective
initial
tumour
stages,
treatment responses and toxicity rates in groups
1 and 2. The
initial tumour stage profile was not significantly different
between
groups
1
and
2.
Moderate and
severe
toxicity
(>grade 2) were reduced from 20% (group
1) to 12.4%
(group 2), 0.02<P<0.05. Severe toxicity was reduced from
9% (group 1) to 6% (group 2), n.s. The dose in the second
half of the course was reduced in 40% of cycles; most 5-FU
reductions were between 30 and 50% of the scheduled dose
for days 3-5. Responses were significantly higher in group 2
(47% CR) compared with group 1 (31% CR), 0.02 <P <0.05.
Also, 15% more cycles could be administered to group 2
than to group 1.
Discussion
Multiple-drug chemotherapy using CDDP and 5-FU is one
of the most
efficient
first-line therapeutic approaches
for
advanced
head
and
neck
carcinomas.
While
treatment
tolerance is usually acceptable, a non-negligible incidence of
toxicity has been reported (Merlano et al., 1987; Amrein &

5-FU THERAPEUTIC MONITORING
289
Weitzman,
1985). In this combination regimen, continuous
5-FU
administration
(Amrein &
Weitzman,
1985)
has
improved haematological tolerance in comparison with bolus
injections
(Merlano
et
al.,
1987).
Stomatitis remains
the
major toxicity with continuous 5-FU; the frequency was 21%
in
131 treatment cycles reported by Amrein & Weitzman
(1985).
Toxicity may lead to lengthening of the interval between
cycles
and
to
reduction
in
the
total number
of cycles
scheduled. In both cases, the dose intensity is reduced. This
might be expected to compromise the cytotoxic activity of a
phase-specific drug such as 5-FU. Indeed, clinical experience
has shown that the number of CDDP-5-FU cycles
is of
prime
importance
for
the
complete
response
rate
and
survival in advanced head and neck cancer (Rooney et al.,
1984). In these patients (Thyss et al., 1986b), we previously
found that the clinical response to CDDP-5-FU is a major
prognostic factor.
It is thus important not to shorten the
chemotherapy
programme
because
of
excessive,
un-
anticipated toxicity.
One of the ultimate goals in clinical pharmacokinetics of
anticancer agents is effective improvement of the therapeutic
index of treatments (Sulkes & Collins, 1987; Allen, 1983).
This 4-year study conducted on 170 patients receiving a total
of 477 CDDP-5-FU cycles attains this goal and confirms our
previous results (Thyss et al., 1986a). This study involved
two
sequential
stages:
a
retrospective
pharmacokinetic
analysis followed by a prospective evaluation. Tolerance to
treatment was significantly improved. Haematological and/or
digestive
tract toxicity attributable
to 5-FU was reduced
from 20 to 12.4%. Moreover, although dose reduction was
performed
in 40%
of cycles
in group
2,
the complete
response rate was significantly higher than in group
1 (Table
II). The proportion of advanced stages (T3, T4) was not
significantly different, and thus cannot explain the difference
in response rates between the two groups. In fact, due to a
better
tolerance
in
group
2,
treatment
compliance
was
greater than in group
1. It is likely that the difference in
response
rates may be due
to a difference
in treatment
intensity between the two groups. It must be kept in mind
that at the target level 5-FU by itself is not active and must
be transformed into FUTP and FdUMP to be cytotoxic
(Myers, 1981). These key biochemical steps are thus decisive
in the activity of the drug.
The possibility of giving more drug to a patient with a low
AUC during the first half of the cycle could be justified
pharmacologically. If mean values are considered, the AUC
values
of the
first
half of cycle
were
lower
for
non-
responders than for complete responders (Table I). However,
the
high
interpatient
variability
in
this
pharmacokinetic
parameter prevented the drawing of statistically significant
conclusions. This particular point merits re-evaluation on a
larger group of patients. However, for patients with a very
low AUCO3 days ( < 5,000 ngml- h-), it might be advisable
to increase the 5-FU dose for the second half of the cycle in
order to obtain an increased chance of better response.
These results emphasise the role of drug AUC as one of
the best pharmacokinetic parameters for predicting pharma-
codynamic events (Powis, 1985). HPLC is now widely used
in most clinical biochemistry laboratories and 5-FU analysis
can thus be easily performed on a routine basis to monitor
treatment. The cost of our policy is evaluated in Appendix 2.
We believe that pharmacokinetic follow-up of these patients
is an objective means to improve their therapeutic index
significantly.
Appendices
Appendix 1: Construction and use of Figure 2
The line has been determined as follows: 15,000 ng ml1h1
is the cut-off value separating significantly toxic from non-
toxic cycles in group
1. This was the starting point for
reducing or not the 5-FU dose for the second part of the
cycle in group 2. We estimated that a 30% dose reduction
(corresponding to 70% of the initial dose scheduled) would
lead to an objective decrease in steady state blood 5-FU. On
the other hand, above an AUCO3 days of 30,000 ng ml-
h-I
all cycles were toxic in group
1. This value is also close to
the median of AUCO5 days for non-toxic cycles of group
1.
Thus above this AUCO3 days threshold it was decided to stop
giving 5-FU during the second part of the cycle in group 2.
For a given patient, X, receiving
1.7 g 5-FU per day
if
AUCO3 days = 20,000 ng ml 1 h-1 at the third day of the cycle
then the 5 FU dose will be changed to 0.77 g per day for the
second
part of the
cycle (45%
of the
initial
dose),
in
accordance with the figure found on the y-axis after the
intercept with the line of the 20,000 value from the x-axis.
For another patient, Y, receiving 1.8g per day and with an
AUCO3 days of 10,000 ng ml-1h-1, the 5-FU dose delivered
during the second part of the cycle will be the same 1.8 g per
day because 10,000 ngml1 h1 is below the x-axis threshold
of 15,000ngml-1h-1.
Appendix 2: Cost of 5-FU monitoring
Because HPLC is now widely used with a high versatility in
most clinical biochemistry laboratories, its specific cost for
the 5-FU analysis can be ignored. Nine blood samples are
measured per 5-FU cycle (5p.m. day
1, 8a.m. and 5p.m.
days 2, 3, 4 and 5) resulting in 27 5-FU analyses per complete
treatment
course
of
three
cycles.
With
our
analytical
conditions 200 samples can be measured with an HPLC
column (mean cost of 2,000 FF) thus leading to a cost of
270 FF per chemotherapy course per patient. Cost for water
and salts of the HPLC buffer is negligible. We evaluated
that, in our institute, 5-FU analysis for one cycle of 5-FU
takes two man hours.

mycin inhibited N-linked glycosylation of nascent 
vWf and the resulting pro-vWf monomers failed to 
dimerize. The single subunits accumulated in the en- 
doplasmic reticulum and were neither processed fur- 
ther nor secreted. In the presence of a weak base (am- 
monium chloride or chloroquine), interdimer disul- 
fide bond formation was inhibited in a dose-depend- 
ent manner. This process appeared therefore to be pH 
sensitive and likely to be initiated in the acidic trans- 
Golgi apparatus (Anderson, R. G. W., and R. K. Pa- 
thak, 1985, Cell, 40:635-643). The weak base had no 
obvious effect on the other processing steps, i.e. di- 
merization, complex carbohydrate formation and sul- 
fation, and produced only slight inhibition of pro- 
sequence cleavage. On the other hand, the weak base 
interfered with the targeting of newly synthesized vWf 
into Weibel-Palade bodies, with all of the vWf being 
secreted constitutively and none stored in the Weibel- 
Palade bodies. In summary, initial glycosylation of the 
nascent vWf protein and low pH in the trans-Golg~ 
apparatus were important conditions for the successful 
polymerization of human vWf. Genetic defects dis- 
rupting any one of these conditions could result in the 
phenotype of von Willebrand disease. 
V 
ON Willebrand factor (vWf) ~ is an adhesive glycopro- 
tein necessary for binding platelets to subendothelium 
after vascular injury (12, 23, 30). vWf is synthesized 
as a large precursor (260,000-mol-wt) that contains high man- 
nose carbohydrate ( 17, 31). After dimer formation and trans- 
port to the Golgi apparatus, the carbohydrate is processed to 
the complex type, the propiece is cleaved, and interdimer 
disulfide bond formation begins (32). Carbohydrate process- 
ing is accompanied by an apparent increase in molecular 
weight of the precursor subunit to 275,000. These observed 
molecular weights of precursor subunits underestimate actual 
size by ~30,000-50,000, as determined by the size of vWf 
cDNA clones that span the vWf messenger RNA (9). 
vWf is stored in the endothelial cells within specific organ- 
elles called Weibel-Palade bodies (34). Secreted vWf consists 
of a series of multimers that range in size from 0.5 to over 20 
x 106 daltons, depending upon the number of dimers that are 
disulfide bonded. In type IIA yon Willebrand disease, only 
the large and intermediate size multimers are lacking (22), 
but patient plasma does not support efficient attachment of 
platelets to subendothelium (24), indicating that multimer 
size is important for vWf biological activity. As yet, the 
cellular defects that are responsible for incomplete polymeri- 
zation of vWf in the type IIA von Willebrand disease are not 
known. 
Abbreviation used in this paper: vWf, yon Willebrand factor. 
Although vWf multimerization is inhibited in vitro by the 
ionophore monensin, the latter affects all of the processing 
steps of the Golgi apparatus (33). In the study presented here, 
we have interfered with the interdimer disulfide bond forma- 
tion more specifically by increasing the pH of the trans-Golgi 
apparatus and we show that inhibition of N-linked glycosyl- 
ation blocks the dimerization process of vWf biosynthesis. 
Materials and Methods 
Cells and Culture Conditions 
Endothelial cells were obtained from human umbilical vein by mild proteolytic 
digestion as described previously (8, 34); only primary cultures were used. Cells 
were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Flow Laboratories, Inc., McLean, VA) 
containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Tunicamycin (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., 
San Diego, CA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, chloroquine (Sigma 
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in water, and ammonium chloride (Fisher 
Scientific Co., Rochester, NY) in culture medium. Control cells were treated 
with the solvent alone. In the case of tunicamycin, cells were pre-treated for 
-14 h with the drug prior to metabolic labeling. For continuous metabolic 
labeling, cells were grown in the presence of [35S]methionine (25-40 uCi/ml, 
18.7 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp, Arlington Heights, IL). In one study, cells 
were labeled overnight with [35S]sodium sulfate (230 ~Ci/ml, 767 mCi/mmol; 
New England Nuclear, Boston MA) in medium containing dialyzed serum 
(20).

described previously (18, 34). Some experiments used antiserum purchased 
from Calbiochem-Behring Corp. Monospecific antifibronectin antiserum was 
a kind gift from Dr. R. O. Hynes (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) (15). 
Ammonium Chloride Treatment of Cells for 
Fluorescence Microscopy 
Cells freshly obtained from the umbilical vein were plated on glass coverslips; 
after 2 d, the medium was replaced with medium containing 5 mM ammonium 
chloride. The cells were grown in this medium for 5 d (with one medium 
change) before being processed for fluorescence microscopy (34). The pH of 
the culture medium containing ammonium chloride was between 7.4-7.6 in 
all experiments. 
Pulse-Chase Experiments in the Presence 
of Tunicamycin 
All media contained l ug/ml of tunicamycin, and incubations were at 37""C. 
Cells were preincubated overnight in medium containing fetal bovine serum 
and for 15 min in serum-free medium. Medium was then removed and the 
cells were covered with l ml serum-free medium containing 1.5 mCi [~S]- 
methionine and incubated for 20 min. Cells were then rinsed in medium 
containing serum and incubated in this medium for varying lengths of time. 
Control cells were treated identically except that all media did not contain 
tunicamycin. 
Purification of v Wf 
vWf was immunopurified as described previously (32) and samples were 
analyzed by gel electrophoresis after the radioactive count was determined. 
Endoglycosidase H Digestion 
The enzyme was a generous gift of Dr. P. W. Robbins (Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology) and was purified according to Tarentino et al. (28). Purified 
vWf was diluted in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 5.8, so that the final concentration 
of SDS was <0.5%. Endoglycosidase H was added (3 #g/ml), and samples were 
incubated for 2 h at 37""C before analysis on gels. 
Electrophoresis Gels 
SDS polyacrylamide gels were prepared as described by Laemmli (14), and 
agarose horizontal slab gels were prepared using a solution of 2% agarose, 0.1% 
SDS in 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. 
Results 
Effect of Tunicamycin on vWf Processing 
and Secretion 
Culturing of human umbilical vein endomelial cells in the 
presence of 1 ~g/ml tunicamycin, an antibiotic which prevents 
N-linked glycosylation by inhibiting the formation of the 
donor dolicol-sugar (27), had a profound effect on vWf proc- 
essing and secretion (Fig. I a). vWf purified from control cells 
contained similar amounts of precursor (260,000-mol-wt) and 
cleaved (220,000-mol-wt) subunits. The tunicamycin-treated 
cells contained only precursor subunits and these were not 
secreted (Fig. 1 a, Medium). Secretion ofvWfwas not restored 
in the presence of the lysosomal enzyme inhibitor, leupeptine 
(3) (not shown). The precursor subunit from the tunicamycin- 
treated cells migrated more rapidly than the 260,000-mol-wt 
precursor of control cells (Fig. I a), because tunicamycin 
inhibited the addition of N-linked carbohydrate to the pre- 
cursor. That most of the high mannose carbohydrate was 
lacking from the subunit was verified by its resistance to 
endoglycosidase H (Fig. I b), which cleaves the chitobiosyl 
unit of high mannose carbohydrate (2 l, 28). Whereas the 
migration of 260,000-mol-wt precursor subunit from un- 
treated cells, which contains high mannose carbohydrate, 
increased after endoglycosidase treatment, that of precursor 
produced by tunicamycin-treated cells was unchanged. 
Figure 1. (a) The effect of tunicamycin on pro-vWf cleavage and 
secretion by human endothelial cells. Cells were incubated overnight 
in the presence (+) or in the absence (-) of 1 ug/ml of tunicamycin 
and then metabolically labeled with [3~S]methionine for 24 h in the 
same medium, vWf was purified from the culture medium and cell 
lysates and analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gels, autoradiographs of 
which are shown. Tunicamycin-treated cells contained precursor 
subunit but no cleaved subunit (220). Secretion of vWf was com- 
pletely inhibited in tunicamycin-treated cells, in that the medium 
lacked the precursor (275) and cleaved subunits (220) that were 
secreted in control cultures. (b) Digestion of pro-vWf synthesized in 
the presence of tunicamycin with endoglycosidase H. vWf purified 
from cells treated in the presence (+) or absence of tunicamycin (-) 
was digested with endoglycosidase H (E). The 260,000-mol-wt pre- 
cursor subunit (260) in control cells contains high mannose carbo- 
hydrate (32); therefore endoglycosidase H treatment produced a shift 
in its migration towards a smaller apparent molecular weight. The 
precursor synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin co-migrated 
with the endoglycosidase H-treated (260,000-mol-wt) precursor pres- 
ent in control cells, and no shift in migration occurred after enzymatic 
treatment. This indicates that tunicamycin inhibited the addition of 
N-linked carbohydrate. The 220,000-mol-wt subunit present in con- 
trol cells is resistant to endoglycosidase H (32), since it contains 
mature complex-type carbohydrate. 
The effect of tunicamycin on dimer formation was studied 
by pulse-chase experiments. Cells preincubated in the pres- 
ence of 1 ug/ml of tunicamycin were labeled with [3~S]- 
methionine for 20 min. The cells were then chased in unla- 
beled medium for varying time intervals. Tunicamycin was 
present during the labeling and the chase periods. Purified 
vWf from treated and control cells was examined nonreduced 
on 4.5% acrylamide gels (Fig. 2). While the monomeric 
precursor in the control cells dimerized almost completely in 
the first hour from the onset of labeling, dimers were not 
formed in the tunicamycin-treated cells. It appears therefore 
that initial glycosylation of vWf precursor monomers is re- 
quired for processing and secretion of vWf. 
Effect of a Weak Base on the Processing of v Wf 
Endothelial cells were metabolically labeled for 3 d in the 
presence of varying concentrations of ammonium chloride to 
determine whether any of the processing steps in vWf biosyn- 
thesis are pH sensitive, vWfwas purified from culture medium 
and lysed cells and analyzed nonreduced (Fig. 3) or reduced 
(Fig. 4a) by gel electrophoresis. Ammonium chloride inhib- 
ited interdimer disulfide bond formation in a dose-dependent 
manner (Fig. 3) that was similar to that produced by monensin 
(33). In contrast to monensin, however, carbohydrate proc- 
essing and precursor cleavage were not significantly affected 
Wagner et al. Requirements for Multimerization of vWf 
1321 
by ammonium chloride, vWf subunits produced by treated 
cells migrated at the same position as subunits from control 
cultures (Fig. 4a) and the secreted material was resistant to 
endoglycosidase H (Fig. 4b), indicating that these subunits 
contained complex-type carbohydrate. Sulfation of vWf (5) 
also was not inhibited by ammonium chloride (not shown). 
The ratios of precursor to mature subunit in secreted vWf 
were quantitated by densitometric scanning. In three inde- 
pendent experiments, precursor cleavage was inhibited only 
20% by 25 mM ammonium chloride, a concentration which 
completely inhibited multimerization ofvWfdimers. Concen- 
trations of 5 mM and higher depleted the endothelial cells of 
processed subunits (Fig. 4a) and small multimers (Fig. 3). 
The ratio of secreted to cell-associated vWfincreased threefold 
in treated cells, duplicating the effect seen with monensin 
(33), and reflected in the loss of Weibel-Palade bodies (Fig. 
5). It appears therefore that the multimerization of vWf and 
the formation of Weibel-Palade bodies from the Golgi appa- 
ratus (26) are pH dependent. The same results (not shown) 
were obtained with another weak base, chloroquine (10-50 
#M), using shorter labeling periods because of the toxic effect 
of chloroquine on cells. The small multimers synthesized in 
the presence of 5 mM NH4C1 contained fully processed sub- 
units, but did not incorporate into endothelial cell extracel- 
lular matrix (Fig. 5), confirming prior observations that vWf 
multimer size is a crucial factor in this interaction (33). 
Figure 2. The effect of tunicamycin on dimerization of wVf. Human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells were metabolically labeled for 20 min 
in the absence (-) or in the presence (+) of 1 #g/ml of tunicamycin 
and then chased in unlabeled medium, vWf was purified from the 
lysed cells and examined nonreduced on a 4.5% acrylamide gel after 
autoradiography. Numbers indicate time in hours from the onset of 
labeling. In control cultures, monomeric vWf formed dimers, while 
in tunicamycin-treated cells the subunit remained monomeric. 
Figure 3. The effect of ammonium chloride on multimerization of 
vWf. Endothelial cells were metabolically labeled for 3 d in the 
presence of ammonium chloride, vWf was purified from the lysed 
cells and culture media and electrophoresed nonreduced on 2% 
agarose gels, autoradiographs of which are shown. Some of the 25 
mM ammonium chloride-treated cells lifted prior to cell lysis and 
therefore less radioactivity was present in this sample. Ammonium 
chloride inhibited interdimer disulfide bond formation in a dose- 
dependent manner and the small multimers produced in its presence 
were not stored in the cells. 
Figure 4. The effect of ammonium chloride on precur- 
sor cleavage and carbohydrate processing of vWf. (a) 
vWf purified from endothelial cells treated as in Fig. 3 
was analyzed reduced on 5% polyacrylamide gels. The 
autoradiograph shows that the majority of the pro-vWf 
subunits were cleaved to the 220,000-mol-wt size in the 
presence of ammonium chloride and that the electro- 
phoretic migration of the subunits did not change with 
increasing concentration of ammonium chloride. (b) 
Endothelial cells were labeled for three days in the 
presence of 25 mM ammonium chloride, and vWf 
purified from lysed cells and culture medium was 
treated with endoglycosidase H (E). Both of the secreted 
subunits (275 and 220) were endoglycosidase H resist- 
ant, indicating that the carbohydrate was processed to 
the complex type. As noted for untreated cultures in 
Fig. I b, only the cellular precursor of 260,000-mol-wt 
was endoglycosidase H sensitive.

Discussion 
Importance of lnitial Glycosylation on Dimerization 
and Intracellular Transport of Human vWf Subunits 
The inhibition of N-linked carbohydrate addition to the grow- 
ing polypeptide chain of vWf by tunicamycin appeared to 
have a profound effect on its subsequent fate. It is likely that 
the carbohydrate provides the vWf monomer with a confor- 
mation that favors dimerization. The presence oftunicamycin 
inhibited the formation of dimers entirely (Fig. 2) and no 
subsequent processing of the pro-vWf monomers took place, 
i.e., the pro-sequence was not cleaved and the monomers were 
not secreted. 220,000-mol-wt monomers are not found in 
untreated endothelial cells, nor are they secreted (32). It 
appears therefore, that only dimer molecules are recognized 
to be packaged for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum 
to the Golgi apparatus where processing continues. The hy- 
pothesis that tunicamycin causes the accumulation of mono- 
meric vWf in the endoplasmic reticulum is further supported 
by strong perinuclear immunofluorescence staining and a 
gradual decrease in Weibel-Palade body number (11; also, 
our unpublished observations). 
Tunicamycin inhibition of vWf transport and processing is 
specific to human endothelial cells, since precursor subunits 
are cleaved and secreted by bovine cells in the presence of 
tunicamycin (17). A tunicamycin-preincubation period of >3 
h was necessary to inhibit N-linked glycosylation. When 
tunicamycin treatment was initiated simultaneous with met- 
abolic labeling, both glycosylated and nonglycosylated pre- 
cursor subunits were produced, and cleavage of the former to 
a 220,000-mol-wt subunit occurred (not shown). This could 
explain the observation by Hormia et al. of three distinct vWf 
bands in reduced samples of tunicamycin-treated human 
endothelial cells (11). 
The presence oftunicamycin resulted in human endothelial 
cell cultures with the phenotype of severe von Willebrand 
disease, i.e. absence of secretion of vWf. Subtle changes in the 
vWf gene, translated into missing glycosylation sites, could 
produce a similar effect in vivo. 
Acidic pH Is Necessary for Multimerization of v Wf 
and for Formation of Weibel-Palade Bodies 
Our previous study (33) on biosynthesis of vWfin the presence 
of the carboxylic ionophore monensin (29) demonstrated 
inhibition of all the processing steps localized to the Golgi 
apparatus. However, the exact mechanisms of this inhibition 
are not known. It has been shown that the Golgi vesicles 
contain a proton pump capable of creating a transmembrane 
pH gradient (10) and since monensin dissipates such a gra- 
dient (2, 4), some of the inhibitory effects of monensin might 
reflect its action on the pH of the Golgi cisternae. We therefore 
decided to compare the effect of a weak base (25) with that 
of monensin on vWf processing and secretion. The difference 
was striking in that monensin blocked all the Golgi-localized 
processing steps (33) while the weak base completely inhibited 
only the interdimer disulfide bond formation (Figs. 3 and 4). 
It appears that monensin acts on the Golgi apparatus by at 
least two different disruptive mechanisms, only one of which 
is abolishment of a pH gradient that can be replicated by a 
weak base. Anderson and Pathak have demonstrated by im- 
munocytochemical techniques that the trans-Golg~ apparatus 
and the forming secretory vesicles are acidic (l). Thus, the 
pH-sensitive multimerization of vWf dimers (Fig. 3) can be 
localized to the trans-Golg~ apparatus and possibly to the 
Weibel-Palade bodies. Two observations lead us to the con- 
clusion that at least some multimerization takes place in the 
Golgi apparatus and that not all multimers are formed in the 
Weibel-Palade bodies. First, multimers larger than dimers are 
produced in the presence of 10 -8 M monensin (33) or 5 x 
10 -3 M ammonium chloride (Fig. 3), but Weibel-Palade 
bodies are not found in cells treated in this manner (11) (Fig. 
5). Second, while only one of the two pathways for secretion 
of vWf by endothelial cells involves the Weibel-Palade bodies 
(16), the protein secreted by both pathways is multimeric 
(Sporn L. A., V. J. Marder, and D. D. Wagner, manuscript 
submitted for publication). Conversion of high mannose to 
complex type carbohydrate is initiated in the central cisternae 
of the Golgi stack (7), consistent with the lack of inhibitory 
effect of ammonium chloride on this processing step (Fig. 
4 b). The pH in the trans-Gol~ apparatus is probably regulated 
Wagner et al. Requirements for Multimerization of vWf 
1323 
by a proton pump (10). Any defects in its functioning would 
be reflected by incomplete multimerization of vWf, resulting 
in the phenotype of type IIA von Willebrand disease. 
The effect that the weak base had on storage of vWf in the 
Weibel-Palade bodies was not entirely unexpected. There are 
two other examples where the presence of a weak base inter- 
feres with the targeting of proteins. Newly synthesized lyso- 
somal enzymes are secreted instead of delivered to the lyso- 
some in the presence of chloroquine (13) and ACTH is 
secreted through a constitutive pathway rather than being 
stored in secretory granules in cells treated with chloroquine 
(19). Despite the differences in size and function of these 
molecules, i.e., lysosomal enzymes, a peptide hormone and a 
large adhesive glycoprotein, a similar pH-dependent mecha- 
nism appears to control their sorting. Perhaps low pH is a 
fundamental requirement for specific binding between a car- 
rier protein (l 3) and the molecule to be delivered to a storage 
or lysosomal vesicle. 
The small amount (20%) of inhibition of precursor cleavage 
observed with high concentrations of ammonium chloride 
(Fig. 4 a) could be due to dilution of the substrate and enzyme 
as the Golgi apparatus dilates under the effect of the drug (6) 
or it could represent the amount of precursor that is removed 
during storage of the molecules (32). Still, even in the presence 
of 25 mM ammonium chloride, the pro-sequence was re- 
moved from most of the vWf subunits, and since multimers 
did not form under these conditions, it is unlikely that mul- 
timerization is a spontaneous process initiated by prosequence 
removal. 
To conclude, we have identified two important conditions 
in the biosynthesis of the large multimers ofvWf: the addition 
of N-linked carbohydrate in the endoplasmic reticulum and 
the acidic pH in the trans-Golgj apparatus and possibly Wei- 
bei-Palade bodies. Interference with these conditions in tissue 
culture by the use of tunicamycin and a weak base, respec- 
tively, produced changes in endothelial cells that were phe- 
notypically similar to those found in von Willebrand disease.

Abstract. Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythro- 
cytes (IRBCs) synthesize several histidine-rich proteins 
(HRPs) that accumulate high levels of [3H]histidine but 
very low levels of amino acids such as [3H]isoleucine 
or [35S]methionine. We prepared a monoclonal anti- 
body which reacts specifically with one of these HRPs 
(Pf HRP II) and studied the location and synthesis of 
this protein during the parasite's intracellular growth. 
With the knob-positive Malayan Camp strain of P. fal- 
ciparum, the monoclonal antibody identified a mul- 
tiplet of protein bands with major species at Mr 72,000 
and 69,000. Pf HRP II synthesis began with immature 
parasites (rings) and continued through the trophozoite 
stage. The Mr 72,000 band of Pf HRP II, but not the 
faster moving bands of the multiplet, was recovered as 
a water-soluble protein from the culture supernatant of 
intact IRBCs. Approximately 50% of the total 
[3H]histidine radioactivity incorporated into the Mr 
72,000 band was extracellular between 2 and 24 h of 
culture. Immunofluorescence and cryothin-section im- 
munoelectron microscopy localized Pf HRP II to 
several cell compartments including the parasite 
cytoplasm, as concentrated ""packets"" in the host eryth- 
rocyte cytoplasm and at the IRBC membrane. Our 
results provide evidence for an intracellular route of 
transport for a secreted malarial protein from the para- 
site through several membranes and the host cell 
cytoplasm. 
T 
HE avian malaria Plasmodium lophurae and the ma- 
jor pathogenic human malaria P. falciparum synthe- 
size proteins of extraordinary histidine content called 
histidine-rich proteins (HRPs). I Asexual blood stage P. 
lophurae parasites synthesize an HRP (P1 HRP) containing 
72 mol % histidine according to amino acid analysis (8) and 
sequencing of genomic DNA (17). Despite the fact that in 
duckling infections it can account for 10% of the total para- 
site dry weight (8) its function is unknown. At least three 
HRPs are made by blood stage P. falciparum, denoted here 
as Pf HRP I, II, and III in order of discovery. Pf HRP I is 
associated phenotypically with expression of knob-like pro- 
trusions on the surface membrane of infected erythrocytes 
(IRBCs) (9). Pf HRP I appears to be associated with the 
IRBC membrane (23), particularly the cytoskeleton (13). Pf

tidine-rieh protein; [3H]-ILEU, [3H]isoleucine; IRBC, infected erythro- 
cyte; K +, knobby; K-, kn0bless; rnAb, monoclonal antibody; Pf HRP I, 
Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein I synthesized only by K* 
parasites; Pf HRP II, Plasmodiumfalciparum histidine-rich protein II syn- 
thesized by K ÷ and K- parasites and reactive with mAb 87; RBC, eryth- 
rocyte. 
HRP II, described in detail in this report, is expressed by 
both knob-positive (K ÷) and knob-negative (K-) IRBCs 
(13), unlike Pf HRP I which is only expressed by K ÷ IRBC 
(5, 9, 24). Sequencing of genomic DNA has shown that Pf 
HRP II contains 35% histidine, as well as relatively high 
contents of alanine and aspartate (40 and 12 %, respectively) 
(25). Pf HRP III has been recently identified by sequencing 
a cDNA clone and shown to contain 30% histidine and 29% 
alanine (19). 
Since the roles that these HRPs play in the complex inter- 
action of blood-stage malaria parasite and vertebrate host are 
unknown, and the structure-function relationship of proteins 
with such high contents of imidazole groups are still a matter 
for conjecture, we have prepared monoclonal antibodies 
(mAb's) to dissect some of their properties. This report 
describes the synthesis and subcellular location of Pf HRP 
II using one of these antibodies (mAb 87). We show that al- 
though a multiplet of bands react with mAb 87 in IRBCs, 
only one of these bands is secreted into the culture superna- 
tant. By immunoelectron microscopy, we could identify Pf 
HRP II in several compartments including the host erythro- 
cyte cytoplasm. Our results provide direct evidence for intra-

cellular trafficking of malarial proteins within IRBCs and 
have several implications for the extent to which the intracel- 
lular parasite can not only alter the properties of the host 
erythrocyte (RBC), but affect the host through secretion of 
soluble proteins. 
Materials and Methods 
Culture and Metabolic Labeling 
Cryopreserved IRBCs of the uncloned K + Malayan Camp strain of P. fal- 
ciparum, derived from Aotus monkeys (13), were thawed (15) and fraction- 
ated on a Percoll gradient containing sorbitol (1) to remove any leukocytes 
and mature IRBCs. The purified ring-IRBCs (5-30% parasitemia) were 
washed twice in RPM11640 and resuspended in culture medium (22). Meta- 
bolic labeling with 100 gCi/mi of [3H]histidine ([3HI-HIS) or [3H]isoleu- 
cine ([3H]-ILEU) was performed as described earlier (13) with 2-3 × 107 
IRBCs/rnl and hematocrits of 2-6%. 
Collection of Supernatants and Cells from Culture 
Cultures were harvested by low-speed centrifugation (300 g, 5 min); the su- 
pernatant was collected and centrifuged again (18,000 g, 30 min at 4°C). 
A portion of the second supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2X 
SDS sample buffer for SDS PAGE analysis. The remaining supernatant was 
stored at -90°C. A third centrifugation of the supernatant (110,000 g, 40 
min at 23°C) had no effect on the SDS PAGE pattern of soluble radiolabeled 
proteins. 
The pelleted cells from low-speed centrifugation were washed once in 
RPMI, resuspended in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; 0.15 M NaCI, 20 
mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3) at 5 × l0 s RBCs/ml, 50 ttl removed for 
SDS PAGE analysis; and the remaining cells were extracted with detergents. 
Detergent Extraction of lRBCs 
IRBCs were resuspended in PBS (5 × 108 RBC/mi) and a mixture of pro- 
tease inhibitors added with vortexing to the following final concentrations: 
1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM chymostatin, 1 mM pepstatin, 2 mM EGTA, and 
2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (all from Sigma Chemical 
Co., St. Louis, MO). An equal volume of 2 % Triton X-100 in PBS was 
added, the sample vortexed, and incubated at 0°C for 30 min. After cen- 
trifugation (18,000 g, 30 min) the supernatant (i.e., Triton X-100 extract) was 
removed. A 50-gl portion of supernatant was mixed with 50 ixl of2X SDS 
sample buffer for SDS PAGE. The remaining Triton X-100 extract was stored 
at -90°C. The pellet (i.e., Triton X-100-insoluble material) was washed 
once with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS (18,000 g, 30 min) and extracted by vor- 
texing for 10-30 win at 23""C with 2% SDS in PBS (in a volume equivalent 
to 109 RBC/mi). Centrifugation (18,000 g, 30 rain, 23°C) fractionated this 
sample into 2% SDS-soluble material (i.e., supernatant) and an insoluble 
pellet. A portion of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2X 
SDS sample buffer for SDS PAGE analysis and the remainder stored at 
-90°C. 
Production of Monoclonal Antibodies and Antiserum 
BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 1 × 107 purified 
IRBCs of Malayan Camp strain, K ÷ P. falciparum emulsified in complete 
Freund's adjuvant. Immunization was repeated at 2 and 7 wk using IRBCs 
in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and finally at 14 wk without adjuvant. 3 d 
later, spleen ceils from the immunized mouse were fused with myeloma cell 
line P3-NSI/1-Ag 4-I (11) according to the method of Galfr6 et al. (4). Cells 
were plated directly into 660 microtiter wells and cultured (18) such that 2 
wk later, 1 or 2 hybrids were observed in all wells. Culture supernatants 
were collected and screened by radioimmunoassay using intact normal Ao- 
tus RBC or K + or K- infected Aotus RBC coated onto plastic microtiter 
wells and mI-goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin. 90% of the wells con- 
tained mAb's against K + and/or K- IRBC but not normal/lotus RBCs. 
These cells were expanded and cryopreserved. Secondary screening was 
performed by immunoprecipitation and SDS PAGE with supernatants from 
expanded cultures that had been concentrated roughly 10-fold by centrifuga- 
tion with Amicon Centriflo Membrane Cones. Cells producing mAb's that 
irnmunoprecipitated a protein labeled with [3H]-HIS but not with [3H]- 
ILEU were passaged into pristane-primed mice for ascites production. In 
this way we identified mAb 87 which immunoprecipitated Pf HRP II (see 
Results). Ouchterlony analysis of rnAb 87 from culture supernatants and im- 
munoelectrophoresis of ascites showed that this antibody was homogeneous 
and of the IgM 0tk) isotype. 
Rabbit antiserum against the P lophurae HRP was prepared by immuni- 
zation with 0.3 mg of protein (purified according to the original protocol 
[8]) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Serum was coUected 1 mo 
after three intramuscular injections at intervals of 6 wk and 6 mo. 
Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron Microscopy 
Immunofluorescence was performed with a 1:100 dilution of mAb 87 ascites 
(or control IgM mAb IA1DS) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse 
Ig (Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA) using thin smears of infected 
blood fixed for 1 s in 100% acetone at 23°C. For immunoelectron micros- 
copy, infected blood was mixed with 1.0% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% 
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 4°C. Speci- 
mens were embedded in 30% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cross-linked 
with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer for 10 rain, then incubated in 
1.3 M sucrose in phosphate buffer for 3 h on a rotator and frozen in liquid 
nitrogen. Thin sections were cut on a Sorvall MTS000 Ultramicrotome at 
-91.5°C with an FS1000 Cryo Sectioning Accessory, picked up on a freez- 
ing drop of 2.3 M sucrose in phosphate buffer, and transferred onto ionized 
carbon-coated formvar grids, according to the methods of Tokuyasu (20). 
After washing in PBS, pH 8.6, containing 0.01 M glycine (PBS-G), the sec- 
tions were incubated with 2 % gelatin in PBS-G for 10 rain, washed with 
PBS-G, and incubated overnight at 23°C on a drop of monoclonal antibody 
solution diluted with PBS-I% BSA. The specimens were washed with 
PBS-I% BSA, incubated 2 h at 23°C on a drop of 20-nm gold particles 
bound to protein A (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), washed with PBS- 
G, and fixed with 1.25% ghitaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. 
Staining was performed using 0.5 % osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer, 
pH 7.4; 2% uranyl acetate in 0.15 M oxalic acid, pH 7.0; and 3% aqueous 
uranyl acetate. The sections were embedded in a mixture of 2% methylcel- 
lulose and 2% polyethylene glycol (M~ 1,540) in distilled water (4:3:3; 
vol/vol/vol). To stain membranes, 3 gl of 0.8% aqueous uranyl acetate was 
included per ml of embedding medium. The dried specimens were exam- 
ined in a JEOL 100CX electron microscope. 
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting 
Supernatants from culture and Triton X-100 extracts of washed IRBCs were 
used directly for immunoprecipitation. SDS extracts were diluted with Tri- 
ton X-100 solution before addition of antibody (6). Immunoprecipitation was 
performed by standard methods (6) using 1(30 I.tl-l.0 ml of antigen solution 
and 20 gl of rabbit antiserum, 200-400 gl of hybridoma supernatant, and 
3-5 gl of mouse ascites. Antigen-antibody complexes were purified using 
Protein A-Sepharose as solid-phase adsorbent (6). In some experiments, 3 
gl of rabbit antiserum to mouse IgM (generously provided by Dr. R. 
Asofsky, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) was in- 
cubated with the primary complexes of mAb 87 for 2 h at 23°C, however, 
since mAb 87 binds directly to Protein A this did not affect the results. 
Immunoblotting was performed with washed IRBCs or culture superna- 
tants solubilized in 1X SDS sample buffer (21). For electrophoretic transfer 
to nitrocellulose (21) (30 V for 16 h at 4°C) we used 0.5 M glycine, 50 mM 
Tris base in 20% vol/vol methanol. After quenching in PBS plus 0.3% 
wt/vol Tween 20 and 0.3% wt/vol bovine serum albumin, sample strips 
were incubated 1-2 h at 23 °C in a 1:100 dilution of ascites in PBS plus 0.05 % 
wt/vol Tween 20. Bound mAb 87 was detected by incubation with rabbit 
anti-mouse IgM serum (1:1,000 dilution, 1 h at 23°C) and t2~I-Protein A 
(1 h at 23°C). The nitrocellulose was dried onto Geibond (FMC Corpora- 
tion, Marine Colloids Div., Rockland, ME) for autoradiography. 
SDS PAGE and Radioactivity Analysis 
SDS PAGE was performed on 1.5-mm-thick gels of 5-15 % acrylamide gra- 
dients using the Laemmli buffer system (12). The distribution of [3H]radio- 
activity was determined by fluorography (2). Radioactivity in individual 
protein bands on dried gels was determined after solubilization with Pro- 
tosol (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) as described earlier (7).

P. falciparum as a cell-associated Mr 72,000 protein strongly 
labeled by biosynthetic uptake of [3H]-HIS but not with 
[3H]-ILEU or [35S]methionine (13). Pf HRP II was also ex- 
pressed by a K- variant of the Malayan Camp strain. In 
contrast, the Mr 92,000 knob-associated HRP (Pf HRP I) of 
the same strain was expressed by the K ÷ parasites but not by 
the K- variant (13). These two HRPs are identified in the 
extreme right lane of Fig. 1, which shows the SDS PAGE pat- 
tern of [3H]-HIS-labeled proteins of K + parasites extracted 
with SDS. It should be noted that uptake of [3H]-amino 
acids into protein by IRBCs implies biosynthetic incorpora- 
tion by the malaria parasite since in control cultures of unin- 
fected erythrocytes none of the proteins described here are 
radiolabeled. 
mAb 87 specifically immunoprecipitated an Mr 72,000 
[3H]-HIS-labeled band from sequential Triton X-100 and 
SDS extracts of washed IRBCs (lanes b, TX-100 and SDS, 
Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation with a control IgM mAb 
(1A1D5) is shown for comparison (lanes c, TX-100 and SDS, 
Fig. 1). Four pieces of evidence indicate that the antigen im- 
munoprecipitated from IRBCs by mAb 87 is Pf HRP II. (a) 
The immunoprecipitated antigen has the same Mr as the 
[3H]-HIS-labeled protein in both detergent extracts (com- 
pare lanes b and d, Fig. 1). The protein in these cell extracts 
characteristically migrates as a broad band with a sharp trail- 
ing edge at Mr 72,000 and diffuse leading edge extending to 
Mr ~60,000. mAb 87 immunoprecipitated an antigen band 
with the same Mr range and appearance. (b) The protein 
immunoprecipitated by mAb 87 is strongly labeled by [3H]- 
HIS uptake but not at all with [3H]-ILEU, pH]leucine, or 
PsSlmethionine. (c) mAb 87 also immunoprecipitates an 
antigen with the same properties as described in points a and 
b from the K- variant of Malayan Camp parasites. Thus, 
expression of the antigen recognized by mAb 87 is not related 
to knob-phenotype, mAb 87 also immunoprecipitated an 
HRP (with slightly different Mr) from two other pairs of K + 
and K- parasites (Howard, R., manuscript in preparation). 
(d) The antigen immunoprecipitated from IRBCs by mAb 87 
co-migrates with a protein immunoprecipitated by antiserum 
to the P. lophurae HRP (not shown). Such rabbit antisera 
have been shown to cross-react with both Pf HRP I and Pf 
HRP II of P. falciparum (10). 
Immunoblotting with mAb 87 (Fig. 2) confirmed the reac- 
tivity of this antibody with PfHRP II. mAb 87 failed to react 
with proteins of uninfected Aotus RBCs transferred to 
nitrocellulose, indicating that the antibody is specific for an 
IRBC antigen. The antibody reacted with a multiplet of 
bands from K ÷ IRBC, the slowest moving component at Mr 
72,000, with faster components, or a smear, extending to Mr 
~50,000. Fig. 2 shows four discrete bands at Mr 72,000, 
63,000, 58,000 and 49,000. The same pattern ofmAb 87 reac- 
tivity was observed with immunoblots of the K- variant of 
the same strain (Howard, R., manuscript in preparation). 
Release of Pf HRP H into Culture Supernatant 
Pf HRP II was identified in supernatants of cultured IRBCs 
by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1) and immunoblotting using 
mAb 87. Fig. 1 shows a single sharp band at Mr 72,000 im- 
munoprecipitated from culture supernatants. This band was 
strongly labeled after biosynthetic labeling with [3H]-HIS, 
but was not labeled with [3H]-ILEU (compare lanes b, SU- 
PERNATANT, Fig. 1), [3H]leucine, or [35S]methionine. The 
extracellutar antigen immunoprecipitated by mAb 87 co- 
migrated with an antigen immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti- 
serum to the P. lophurae HRP (lanes a, SUPERNATANT, Fig. 
l), confirming its identity as an HRE Identical results were 
obtained with the K- variant (not shown). Immunoblotting

were solubilized in 5 % SDS

mouse IgM, immune com-

of culture supernatants with mAb 87 also identified a single 
sharp band of antigen reactivity at M~ 72,000. This superna- 
tant antigen corresponded in apparent Mr to the trailing 
edge of the Pf HRP II band associated with washed IRBCs. 
Thus, mAb 87 reacts with a multiplet of Pf HRP II in IRBCs 
(Mr 72,000-50,000) and a single antigenically related band 
of Mr 72,000 in culture supernatants. 
Kinetics of HRP Synthesis and Release 
of Pf HRP H into Supernatants 
A kinetic experiment was performed to examine the relation- 
ships between the extracellular Pf HRP II, the intracellular 
Pf HRP II, and the pool of Pf HRP I that previous studies 
have associated with intracellular or membrane fractions of 
IRBCs. It was also of interest to determine whether Pf HRP 
II was released from intact IRBCs before the time of cell rup- 
ture and parasite reinvasion. Purified IRBCs containing a 
synchronous population of immature ring-stage parasites 
were cultured directly with [3H]-HIS and samples of culture 
supernatant and cells collected at various times and elec- 
trophoresed. The results of SDS PAGE and fluorography for 
the washed cells and the 24 h supernatant are shown in Fig. 
3. HRPs were excised from the gels and uptake of [3H]-HIS 
radioactivity into individual bands was measured (Fig. 4). 
During the first 16 h of in vitro culture with [3H]-HIS, as 
ring stages developed into trophozoites, a doublet of pro- 
teins, Mr 72,000 and 69,000, were the quantitatively major 
[3H]-HIS labeled proteins associated with washed IRBCs. 
From parallel cultures with [3H]-ILEU in which these 
bands were not radiolabeled we could identify both of these 
proteins as HRPs. This Mr 72,000 HRP corresponds in Mr 
with slowest moving Pf HRP II antigen reactive with mAb 
87 by both immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1) and immunoblotting 
(Fig. 2). The Mr 69,000 HRP was particularly well resolved 
from the Mr 72,000 band in Fig. 3. It corresponds to part of 
the faster moving zone of Pf HRP II (Mr 50,000-72,000) 
seen in other experiments (see Figs. 1 and 2). 
Although ring-stage malaria parasites are relatively inac- 
tive in protein synthesis (16), it was notable that synthesis of 
the Mr 72,000 and Mr 69,000 HRP occurred in the first 2 h 
of culture. The Mr 69,000 band did not continue to accumu- 
late additional radioactivity after 12 h. In contrast, radioac- 
tivity accumulated continuously up to 20-24 h in the Mr 
72,000 protein. The Mr 72,000 protein was found in the cul- 
ture supernatant and in the washed IRBCs, while the Mr

Figure 4. Quantitative analysis of the kinetics of labeling HRP dur- 
ing synchronous parasite growth. After fluorography of the gel 
shown in Fig. 3, sections of the gel were excised and their [3HI ra- 
dioactivity counted. (o) M, 72,000 HRP in culture supernatant; 
(e) Mr 72,000 HRP in IRBC; (1) Mr 69,000 HRP in IRBC; ([]) Mr 
92,000 HRP in IRBC; (ll) Mr 83,000 HRP in IRBC. At the times 
indicated by arrows the parasite morphology is shown as the per- 
centage of total parasite as rings (R), trophozoites (T), or schizonts 
(S). Similar results were obtained in another experirnent with a 
different cryopreservate. 
69,000 protein was only recovered from the washed IRBCs 
(Fig. 3). Approximately half the total radioactivity in the 
Mr 72,000 protein was found in the supernatant at any time 
(Fig. 4). This protein was the dominant [3H]-HIS-labeled 
protein in the culture supernatant such that at the film ex- 
posure time shown in Fig. 3 it was the only component de- 
tected (see also Fig. 1, lane d, SUPERNATANT). 
The knob-associated HRP of Malayan Camp strain para- 
sites (Pf HRP I) first incorporated [3H]-HIS between 8 and 
12 h of culture, steadily accumulated more radioactivity up 
to 20 h of labeling and then failed to accumulate additional 
radioactivity (Figs. 3 and 4). Another [3H]-HIS-labeled 
protein at Mr 83,000 incorporated low level radioactivity at 
2 and 8 h, increased to maximal uptake of 8-12 h, and con- 
tained less radioactivity thereafter (Figs. 3 and 4). In other 
experiments we have established that this protein is antigeni- 
caily cross-reactive with Pf HRP I (Leech, J., unpublished 
results). The flow of [3H]-HIS radioactivity through this Mr 
83,000 protein and its antigenic relatedness to Pf HRP I are 
compatible with the hypothesis that this molecule is a 
precursor for Pf HRP I. An analogous relationship was pro- 
posed for an Mr 75,000 HRP of FCR-3/Gambia strain K ÷ 
parasites and the Mr 80,000-85,000 Pf HRP I of this para- 
site (10). 
Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron 
Microscopy with mAb 87 
The immunofluorescence results with mAb 87 and acetone- 
fixed IRBCs of K ÷ Malayan Camp Strain parasites are 
shown in Fig. 5. Identical results were obtained with K- 
parasites of the same strain, mAb 87 reacted in a diffuse 
granular pattern over the entire IRBC containing ring, 
trophozoite, or early schizont stages. This implies the pres- 
ence of the antigen recognized by mAb 87 in the host cell 
cytoplasm. Often, less fluorescence was seen over part of the 
IRBC that appeared to correspond to the location of the 
malaria parasite (Fig. 5,a and b). The fluorescence intensity 
increased as the parasite matured (compare Figs. 5,a and b). 
With mature IRBC in which individual merozoites had seg- 
mented, the immunofluorescence pattern was quite different. 
A pronounced granular pattern was observed at this stage 
with the antigen concentrated in very small areas localized 
to individual parasites. Uninfected RBCs were always nega- 
tive by immunofluorescence. 
These results are consistent with the identification of the 
antigen recognized by mAb 87 (Pf HRP II) as a malarial pro- 
tein that is synthesized and present throughout the asexual 
growth cycle. The presence of strong imrrlunofluorescence in 
the host cell cytoplasm is also consistent with the release of 
Pf HRP II from intact IRBCs and the fact that this antigen 
must somehow traverse the host cell cytoplasm to be released 
as a soluble protein. 
The subcellular distribution of Pf HRP II was examined 
in greater detail by cryothin-section immunoelectron micros- 
copy using mAb 87 (Fig. 6). The location of bound mAb 87

immunofluorescence patterns for K + and K- parasites were identical when compared at the same parasite stage. No fluorescence was ob- 
served in controls omitting primary antibody or using a control mAb as primary antibody. Bar, 10 lam.

was identified by the pattern of Protein A-conjugated colloi- 
dal gold particles. Gold particles were associated with 
IRBCs of all stages of parasite maturity but not with unin- 
fected RBCs. They occurred as clusters within the cytoplasm 
of the intracellular malaria parasite, as very dense clusters 
or ""packets"" within the cytoplasm of the host cell, and as pe- 
ripheral clusters at and just exterior to the IRBC surface 
membrane (Figs. 6, b and c). The dense ""packets"" of gold 
particles in the host cell cytoplasm were often but not invaria- 
bly associated with a localized deposit of electron-dense 
material (e.g., Fig. 6 c). These ""packets"" of gold particles 
were occasionally seen at the unit membrane vesicles (or 
""Maurer's clefts"") in the host cell cytoplasm, but more often 
these clefts were entirely devoid of gold particles (e.g., Fig. 
6 c). The gold clusters associated with the periphery of the 
IRBCs were generally immediately under the IRBC mem-

brane (Fig. 6 b), suggestive of an intracellular location for 
Pf HRP I] just before release. The peripheral clusters occa- 
sionally appeared to be extracellular but it is impossible to 
exclude the possibility that the RBCs membrane was sec- 
tioned tangentially at these points. In some sections, the pe- 
ripheral clusters were located at knobs (e.g., Fig. 6 b), but 
there were many sections in which no knob protrusions of 
the IRBC membrane bound colloidal gold. 
The patterns of reactivity for Protein A-gold were shown 
to reflect specific binding of mAb 87. In the absence of mAb 
87 or with a control monoclonal as primary antibody, very 
few gold particles were associated with IRBCs (Fig. 6 a). 
When particles did appear in these control sections they were 
present as single, or at most, two particles together, unlike 
the clusters of up to ~80 particles seen with rnAb 87. 
The reactivity of mAb 87 within the malaria parasite 
confirms the identification of Pf HRP II as a malarial protein. 
It was noted that in any section of trophozoites probed with 
mAb 87 there were less gold particles in the parasite than in 
the host cell cytoplasm, consistent with the immunofluores- 
cence data and the release of >40 % of Pf HRP II into culture 
supernatants. The presence of gold particles in ""packets"" in 
the host cell cytoplasm and at the IRBC periphery is also 
consistent with the release of the Pf HRP II antigen from in- 
tact IRBCs. 
Discussion 
This report has demonstrated that a P. falciparum HRP, Pf 
HRP II, is synthesized by the intraerythrocytic asexual para- 
site and exported through the erythrocyte cytoplasm and sur- 
face membrane to accumulate in the extracellular culture su- 
pernatant. An IgM mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb 87) 
was shown to specifically react with Pf HRP II, thereby al- 
lowing us to study both the molecular form of this antigen 
by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and the subcel- 
lular location of Pf HRP II by immunofluorescence and 
cryothin-section immunoelectron microscopy. 
Previous reports distinguished Pf HRP II from the two 
other HRP of P. falciparum according to its expression by 
both K + and K- parasites (10, 13) (unlike Pf HRP I which is 
only expressed by K + parasites [5, 9, 13, 24]) and its Mr on 
SDS PAGE (Pf HRP UI or SHARP is considerably smaller, 
Mr ,~21,000 [19]). mAb 87 further distinguishes Pf HRP II 
since this antibody did not react with the other HRPs by im- 
munoprecipitation or immunoblotting (Figs. 1 and 2). 
Several lines of evidence show that Pf HRP II as identified 
here with mAb 87 is in fact ""histidine rich: First, im- 
munoprecipitation of biosynthetically radiolabeled malarial 
proteins with mAb 87 showed that Pf HRP II was labeled 
by uptake of [3H]-HIS but not by uptake of [3H]-ILEU, 
[3H]leucine, or [35S]methionine (e.g., Fig. 1). This result 
has been obtained with several isolates of K + or K- para- 
sites cultured in Aotus or human erythrocytes (not shown). 
The analogous protein (Mr 65,000) of FCR-3/Gambia strain 
parasites was also found to incorporate [3H]-HIS but no de- 
tectable labeled proline, serine, or lysine (10). Second, mAb 
87 has been used to screen a LGT 11 genomic expression li- 
brary of P. falciparum and identified a fusion protein with 
a peptide sequence corresponding to part of the gene encod- 
ing Pf HRP II (25). The deduced protein sequence from 
sequencing genomic DNA contains 35 % histidine and nu- 
merous tandem repeats of Ala-His-His-Ala-Ala-Asp or Ala- 
His-His (25). Third, Pf HRP II (as immunoprecipitated by 
mAb 87) co-migrated with a [3H]-HIS-labeled antigen im- 
munoprecipitated by rabbit antiserum against the P. lophurae 
HRP (Fig. 1). Such rabbit antisera, raised against a protein 
containing 72 mol % histidine, appear to immunoprecipitate 
several HRPs from P falciparum (reference 10, and Howard, 
R., unpublished data), presumably through immunocross- 
reactivity with sequences of contiguous histidine residues. 
The recovery of Pf HRP II from culture supernatants also 
distinguishes this HRP from PfHRP I (comparable informa- 
tion is not yet available for Pf HRP HI). Pf HRP I is only 
solubilized from IRBCs by treatment with 1-2 % SDS (refer- 
ence 13, and see Fig. 1) or by freeze-thaw of parasites and 
suspension in pH 8.5 buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 and 
5 mM EDTA (10). In contrast, Pf HRP II was identified as 
a water-soluble extracellular protein that could not be 
pelleted by centrifugation (110,000 g, 40 min), as well as a 
component of washed IRBCs (Fig. 1). 
Extracellular Pf HRP II could arise by artifactual lysis of 
immature IRBCs, by lysis of mature IRBCs at the time of 
parasite liberation and reinvasion of new RBCs, or by a 
specific process of release from intact IRBCs containing liv- 
ing parasites. The following results demonstrate that Pf HRP 
II is released from RBCs containing growing parasites. Pf 
HRP II was recovered from 2 and 8 h culture supernatants 
of ring-IRBCs that had been purified before in vitro cul- 
ture in such a way that mature parasitized IRBCs were re- 
moved. The ring-infected RBCs are much less likely to lyze 
artifactually in vitro than mature IRBCs. Furthermore, im- 
munofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy local- 
ization studies with acetone or paraformaldehyde/glutar- 
aldehyde-fixed IRBCs, respectively, identified Pf HRP II 
in the cytoplasm of the IRBCs (Figs. 5 and 6). In particular, 
the electron microscopy studies identified ""packets"" of Pf 
HRP II en route to the RBC membrane and under this mem- 
brane in cells with morphologically intact, normal parasites. 
Thus, Pf HRP II is exported from the parasite to the culture 
supernatant as a normal metabolic process. 
The kinetics of synthesis of Pf HRP II during the asexual 
growth cycle also distinguish Pf HRP II from Pf HRP I. 
Pf HRP II incorporated [3H]-HIS radioactivity within 2 h 
when immature parasites (ring-stages) were cultured, where- 
as Pf HRP I was not labeled until between 6 and 10 h of cul- 
ture (Figs. 3 and 4). An earlier study showed that Pf HRP 
I was first synthesized 9 h after merozoite reinvasion and cor- 
related its synthesis and recovery from purified erythrocyte 
membranes with the time of appearance of knobs at the 
erythrocyte membrane (23). It should be noted that not only 
is synthesis of Pf HRP II separated kinetically from knob 
synthesis, but that Pf HRP II is synthesized by both K ÷ and 
K- P. falciparum (10, 13). Our kinetic studies also identified 
an HRP of Mr 83,000 that appears to be a kinetic precursor 
of the Mr 92,000 Pf HRP I molecule (Figs. 3 and 4). Simi- 
lar results were obtained with the FCR-3/Gambia strain of 
parasites wherein an Mr 72,000 precursor of an Mr 85,000 
Pf HRP I was identified (10), although a separate set of ex- 
periments failed to identify a precursor to Pf HRP I (23). 
One of the most intriguing properties of Pf HRP II is the 
identification of a multiplet of bands reactive with mAb 87 
with washed IRBCs (Mr ~50,000-72,000), yet recovery of 
only one of these bands (Mr 72,000) in the extracellular 
Howard et al. P. Falciparura-soluble Histidine-rich Protein 
1275 
medium (Fig. 1). This property is shared by at least five other 
isolates of P. falciparum: only the slowest moving band as- 
sociated with IRBCs is exported from the cells (Howard, R., 
unpublished results). We do not know the structural basis for 
the differences in apparent Mr on SDS PAGE for the multi- 
ple Pf HRP II bands found within IRBCs. These cell- 
associated forms of Pf HRP II appear to be different to the 
extracellular Pf HRP II, since although hypotonic lysis of 
IRBC releases some of these bands into the supernatant, the 
bulk of radioactivity in the Pf HRP II multiplet requires Tri- 
ton X-100 or SDS to effect solubilization (Fig. 1). Since the 
apparent Mr of the extracellular Pf HRP II is higher than 
that of some of the cell-associated bands, proteolysis alone 
is probably not the mechanism for generation of the water- 
soluble Pf HRP II exported from the cell. 
Our studies on the subcellular localization of Pf HRP II 
visualized export of this protein from the parasites via the 
host cell cytoplasm, to the extracellular medium. They also 
raise several fascinating questions that await additional ex- 
periments. Indirect immunofluorescence of acetone-fixed 
IRBCs with mAb g7 localized Pf HRP II within the asexual 
parasite (rings, trophozoites, and schizonts) and also within 
the cytoplasm of the host RBC (Fig. 5). This was confirmed 
more precisely by cryothin-section immunoelectron micros- 
copy using mAb 87 and Protein A-gold (Fig. 6). Gold par- 
ticles were evident as very dense clusters or ""packets"" in 
the RBC cytoplasm, some of which were associated with 
electron-dense material of unknown composition, while 
other clusters were associated with the unit membrane clefts 
(Maurer's clefts). Many gold particles were detected directly 
under the RBC membrane. The presence of dense ""packets"" 
of Pf HRP II in the host RBC cytoplasm and under the RBC 
membrane is consistent with the recovery of Pf HRP II in the 
culture supernatant and the implication that Pf HRP II must 
traverse the host cytoplasm. These results provide the first 
detailed evidence for the subcellular route of export of a 
malarial antigen from the intraerythrocytic parasite to (and 
in this case, through) the host erythrocyte membrane. It will 
be of great interest to determine whether other malarial anti- 
gens, especially membrane-associated proteins destined for 
expression on the surface of the IRBC (14), move indepen- 
dently of Pf HRP II through the RBC cytoplasm. We would 
predict that separate subcellular routes and mechanisms of 
antigen trafficking must exist in malaria-infected cells for 
water-soluble and membrane-associated antigens. Addition- 
al studies are also required to explain how Pf HRP II tra- 
verses the two membrane barriers that appear to separate the 
intraerythrocytic parasite from the extracellular medium 
(i.e., the parasitophorous vacuole membrane sheathing the 
parasite and the host RBC membrane). From our immuno- 
electron microscopic results, there is no obvious morpholog- 
ical explanation for movement of the dense ""packets"" of Pf 
HRP II through these topological barriers. 
The function of Pf HRP II for the malaria parasite has not 
yet been explored. Since at any time during the asexual cycle 
roughly 50% of this protein was extracellular (Fig. 4), it is 
likely that it has some special function in the extracellular 
medium. In vivo, this would correspond to the blood plasma. 
By radioimmunoassay, we have identified an antigen in 
malarious plasma or sera which reacts with mAb g7 (Taylor, 
D., unpublished data). An assay for circulating Pf HRP II 
may be useful for diagnosis of low levels of blood parasites. 
One speculative role of HRP in plasma during malaria 
stems from in vitro studies demonstrating an inhibitory effect 
of L-histidine on neutrophil-mediated intraceUular killing of 
P. falciparum (3). Neutrophils can mediate intracellular kill- 
ing of asexual P. falciparum parasites via the release of free 
radicals (3). The capacity of L-histidine to react with free 
radicals and thereby neutralize their effect on malaria para- 
sites could be fulfilled in vivo by the high histidine content 
of Pf HRP II released into the plasma. 
To conclude, using an mAb that reacts specifically with Pf 
HRP II, we have shown this protein to be very different to 
Pf HRP I, or the knob-associated HRP of P. falciparum, in 
that it is exported from living infected cells into the extracel- 
lular medium. This study has identified a subcellular route 
of trafficking of Pf HRP II from the parasite, through the host 
cell cytoplasm, to the plasma, where we presume this un- 
usual protein mediates a function for the intracellular malar- 
ia parasite. Numerous questions remain to be addressed con- 
cerning not only its function, but the structural basis for its 
size heterogeneity within the cell and its precise mechanism 
of export.

Note Added in Proof'. Using a rabbit antiserum raised against a pentapeptide 
repeat of Pf HRP III (25) we have identified this HRP as a quantitatively 
minor biosynthetically labeled protein of M, 45,000 with Malayan Camp P. 
falciparum, mAb 87 cross-reacts weakly with Pf HRP III on im- 
munoprecipitation. A rabbit antiserum raised against the hexapeptide repeat 
of Pf HRP II (25) does not cross-react with Pf HRP Ill (or Pf HRP I). The 
results of immunofluorescence and cryothin-section immunoelectron mi- 
croscopy with the rabbit antiserum to Pf HRP II are identical to those 
reported here for mAb 87.
