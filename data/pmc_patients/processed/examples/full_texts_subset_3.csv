Many case reports have suggested an association between Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and cancer,
but studies of the cancer incidence in larger groups of men with KS are lacking. A cohort of 696 men with KS
was established from the Danish Cytogenetic Register. Information on the cancer incidence in the cohort was
obtained from the Danish Cancer Registry and compared with the expected number calculated from the age.
period and
site specific cancer rates for Danish men. A total of 39 neoplasms were diagnosed (relative
nsk = 1.1). Four mediastinal tumours were observed (relative risk = 67):
all four were malignant germ cell
tumours. No cases of breast cancer or testis cancer were observed. One case of prostate cancer occurred within
a previously irradiated field. No excess of leukaemia or lymphoma was found. An increased risk of cancer
occurred
in the age group 15-30 years (relative risk = 2.7). All
six tumours in this group were germ cell
tumours or sarcomas. The overall cancer incidence is not increased and no routine cancer screening seems to
be justified. A considerably elevated risk of mediastinal germ cell tumours occurs in the period from early
adolescence until the age of 30.

manifestations. The diagnosis is rarely made before puberty
because of the paucity of clinical manifestations in childhood.
The karyotype is most frequently 47,XXY, but other variants
(mosaicism or more than two X chromosomes) may be
found. KS is the most common sex chromosome disorder,
occurring in about one out of 600 males (Gerald,
1976;
Nielsen and Wohlert, 1991).
KS has been reported to be associated with a variety of
neoplasms,
including
several haematological
malignancies:
acute myeloid
leukaemia (Mamunes
et
al.,
1961;
Muts-
Homsma et al.. 1982; Foot et al.. 1992). acute lymphocytic
leukaemia (Gale and Toledano.
1984; Shaw et al.,
1992),
chronic myeloid leukaemia (Oguma et al.. 1989; Adhvaryu et
al..
1990).
chronic
lymphocytic
leukaemia
(Pienkos
and
Meisner, 1991) and lymphomas (Groupe Francais de Cyto-
genetique Hematologique. 1988; Liang et al., 1990; Koyama
et al., 1992). It has often been concluded that KS predisposes
to leukaemia. however this assumption is almost exclusively
based upon case reports and may be the result of a chance
association. There is more evidence to support a hypothesis
of an increased risk of breast cancer (Scheike et al., 1973).
although a review published in 1987 identified only 27 cases
(Evans and Crichlow. 1987).
A
relatively
large
number
of extragonadal
germ
cell
tumours have been reported associated with KS, the vast
majority located in the mediastinum (Dexeus et al.,
1988;
Gohji et al., 1989). A recent review described 40 cases of
primary mediastinal germ cell tumours associated with KS
(Hasle et al., 1992). Compiled data demonstrated a frequency
of KS among male
patients with
mediastinal germ
cell
tumours of at least 8%, or 50 times the expected frequency
(Hasle
et
al.,
1992). In contrast to the many reports of
extragonadal germ cell tumours, there have been only a few
reports of testicular tumours (Carroll et al., 1988; Dexeus et
al., 1988; Reddy et al., 1991).
No studies of cancer incidence in cohorts of men with KS
have been published. A study of the causes of death in 466
men with KS showed an increased mortality from cerebro-
vascular disease, but based on 15 neoplasms no increase in
the overall cancer mortality. However, two deaths from car-

cinoma of the breast were observed. which was similar to the
expected incidence in women (Price et al.. 1985).
The many case reports of KS and cancer are suggestive of
a relationship. but do not allow any estimates of the relative
risk of cancer in men with KS. Such data are important to
help in prenatal counselling and to physicians who take care
of patients with KS. This study presents the cancer incidence
in a large cohort of men with KS with a virtually complete
follow-up.
Materials and methods
The stud) cohort
The Danish Cytogenetic Register was founded in 1968 and
has
collected
information on chromosomal
abnormalities
diagnosed in Denmark (Nielsen. 1980). The register is based
upon reports from seven cytogenetic laboratories throughout
the country.
It is assumed that the register has a virtually
complete coverage of the constitutional chromosomal abnor-
malities diagnosed in Denmark since 1961.
A total of 707 men with a diagnosis of KS were registered
in the Cytogenetic Register by December 1992. Two persons
were not Danish
residents and were excluded from
the
cohort. Two persons were excluded because of insufficient
follow-up data. Six persons were excluded because of an
additonal somatic trisomy (five with trisomy 18 and one with
trisomy 21). One of the prenatally diagnosed patients had a
twin brother with normal karyotype and had to be excluded
from
the
study
because
the
case
person
could
not
be
identified. Accordingly, the final study cohort consisted of
696 men with KS, of whom 20 were diagnosed prenatally.
Follow-up
Information on vital status and emigration of persons in the
cohort were obtained by linkage

Population Register using the personal identification number.
unique to every Danish resident. For those who died before
the introduction of the personal identification number in
1968 information on vital status was sought by contact with
the local municipal population
registries. By
this method
follow-up data were obtained for the entire cohort except for
the previously mentioned two persons who consequently were
excluded.
Each person was followed up from
1 January 1943 (or
from the day of birth for persons born after this date) until
date of death, emigration or 31 December 1991, whichever
occurred first.
Information on the cancer incidence was obtained from the
Danish
Cancer
Registry,
which
since
1943
has
received
notifications
on malignant
diseases from
all
clinical and
pathological departments in the country. The notifications to
the
registry
are supplemented by a scrutiny of all death
certificates. The registry is considered to have a practically
complete coverage of the occurrence of cancer in Denmark
(Storm,
1988).
All cases of ambiguous or unusual cancer notification in
the cohort were verified by a review of the
clinical and
pathological data from the hospital where the patient had
been treated.
Statistical analysis
The site-specific cancer incidence in the study cohort was
compared with the expected incidence, which was calculated
from the 5 year age- and period-specific rates for all Danish
men. The relative risk was calculated as the ratio of the
observed vs the expected number. The statistical evaluation
was based on the calculation of 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) on the assumption that the observed number follows a
Poisson distribution. The relative risk was considered to be
statistically different from

Results
The year of birth in 10-year periods of the 696 men with KS
is shown in Figure 1. The number of men diagnosed with KS
was relatively low in the early 1960s, but from 1968 onwards
has remained fairly stable, with about 25 new cases ascer-
tained each year. Most of the men were diagnosed in adoles-
cence or young adulthood (56% were diagnosed between the
age of 15 and 35 years). The mean age at the cytogenetic
investigation (excluding the prenatal cases) was 27 years and
decreased with year of examination (37 years in 1961 -65 and

duet
(relative
risk = 9.6, 95%
Cl = 1.1-34). Of the nine cases of lung tumours, two were
anaplastic carcinomas, three were adenocarcinomas and four
were squamous cell carcinomas.
Four cases of mediastinal tumours occurred; all four were
malignant non-seminomatous germ cell tumours in young
men (age range 14-29 years).
No cases of testicular tumour (expected 1.8) and only one
case of prostate carcinoma (expected
2.2) occurred. The
patient with prostate cancer had a perineal rhabdomyosar-
coma at the age of 19 which was treated with radiotherapy
and prostate cancer developed within the field of radiation 40
years later.
Two
brain
tumours
were
noted.
Bilateral
acoustic
neurilemmomas were found in a 31-year-old. One patient had
at the age of 20 a tumour in the posterior part of the third
ventricle. Biopsy was not obtained. The location and the
clinical history make pineal germinoma the most likely diag-
nosis.
Low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma developed in a 47-
year-old and in a 63-year-old. One case of chronic lymphatic
leukaemia was observed in a 77-year-old man.
Three sarcomas occurred while only 0.8 was expected: an
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in the perineum of a 19-year-
old, an alveolar soft-tissue sarcoma in the thoracic region in
a 43-year-old and an osteosarcoma in a 21-year-old.
The observed and expected numbers of cancer cases in
different age groups are shown in Table III. An excess of
cancer was observed in the age group 15-30 years. The six
cases of cancer in this age group were: two sarcomas, three

and

Of the 36 men with cancer, 29 (81%) showed the classic
KS karyotype (47,XXY).
Six showed
different
types of
47,XXY mosaics and the patient with cancer of the lip had a
48,XXXY karyotype.

KS remains undiagnosed in a significant number of men. A
Danish study of systematic chromosome examinations of
liveborn infants found KS in one out of every 600 boys
(Nielsen and Wohlert, 1991), corresponding to about 50 boys
with KS born each year in Denmark. Cytogenetically recog-
nised cases of KS in Denmark number fewer than 15 per
year of birth (Figure 1), which represents less than 30% of
the expected number of cases. The frequency of cytogeneti-
cally diagnosed KS decreases with increasing distance to the
nearest cytogenetic laboratory and increases in areas close to
laboratories with a special interest in KS (Nielsen, 1980). The
more abnormal the phenotype, the more likely is KS to be
diagnosed. Consequently, the cohort is not representative of
all men with KS, but only of those with cytogenetically
recognised KS.
The cohort consists of men with cytogenetically diagnosed
KS. The karyotype analysis has only been available from
1961. The cancer occurrence has been followed from 1943
onwards. The design implies a risk of selection bias during
the first decades of the observation period, because only

became available would be included in the cohort. This could
result in an underestimation, particularly of tumours with a
high mortality
rate. An analysis of the observed
vs the
expected numbers of cancer cases in 10-year periods did not
show any change in the relative risk with time (data not
shown).
Patients with cancer undergo a large number of investiga-
tions which might introduce a surveillance bias resulting in a
higher rate of recognised KS in those men who develop
cancer. However, an analysis of the temporal relationship
between the time of the cancer and the KS diagnosis showed
that in only four men was KS diagnosed during the year that
followed the cancer diagnosis. In five men KS was diagnosed
more than a year from the cancer diagnosis In the remaining
27 patients cancer was diagnosed after the establishment of
the KS diagnosis.
The two types of selection bias (cancer diagnosed without
the recognition of KS and KS diagnosed as a result of the
cancer diagnosis) may influence the relative risk of cancer in
opposite directions. The analyses we have performed indicate
that the possible bias did not have any major effect on the
estimate of the overall risk of cancer in the study.
Several reports have been published on the occurrence of
cancer in children with KS (Gale and Toledano, 1984; Liang
et al., 1990; Foot et al., 1992; Hasle et al., 1992; Shaw et al.,
1992). In this study only one childhood tumour was observed
(malignant germ cell tumour of the mediastinum in a 14-
year-old) as compared with one expected case. However, KS
is seldom diagnosed in prepubertal boys because of the
paucity of clinical manifestations in childhood. Therefore,
KS
is likely to be diagnosed mainly in those boys who
survive childhood cancer and may even then be overlooked
because the infertility may be considered
to be therapy
related. Consequently, the present study is less capable of
evaluating the risk of childhood cancer in boys with KS.
No cases of breast cancer were observed. The expected
number was only 0.05 and the previously reported 20-fold
inCreased risk (Scheike et al., 1973) may be overlooked in this
study. The paper by Scheike et al. (1973) included a Danish
patient not included in this study. The KS diagnosis was
ascertained as part of a research protocol on breast cancer in
men and not reported to the Cytogenetic Register. The mean
age of the reported patients with breast cancer and KS is 58
years (Evans and Crichlow, 1987), and a longer follow-up of
the
present cohort
is needed
to
obtain a more precise
estimate of the risk of breast cancer. It has been claimed that
the risk of breast cancer in men with KS is similar to the
incidence in women (Jackson et al., 1965; Price et al., 1985).
Screening mammography in patients with KS has been con-
sided (Evans and Crichlow, 1987), or even prophylactic
total mastectomy (Miller and Lynch, 1985). By applying the
age-specific rates for breast cancer in women to the present
cohort, the expected number of breast cancers was calculated
to be 9.4 Our findings are not consistent with the assumption
of a similar risk of breast cancer in men with KS and in
women and give no justification for routine screeing or
prophylactic surgery.
No increased risk of either leukaemia or lymphoma was
noticed. This
is in contrast to the many reports of KS
associated
with
lymphoma
(Group
Fran$ais
de
Cytog6n6tique Hematologique,
1988;
Liang
et
al.,
1990;
Koyama et al., 1992) and especialy leukaemia (Mamunes et
al., 1961; Muts-Homsma et al., 1982; Gale and Toledano,
1984; Oguma et al., 1989; Adhvaryu et al., 1990; Pienkos and
Meisner, 1991; Foot et al.,
1992; Shaw et al.,
1992). An
increased risk of acute myeloid leukaemia of up to
100-fold
has been reported (Muts-Homsma
et al., 1982). Major text-
books of medicine and haematology mention KS as a predis-
posing condition to leukaemia and lymphoma (Champlin and
Golde, 1991; Nadler, 1991; Greer and Kinney, 1993). The
many reports of haematological malignancies associated with
KS and the widespread interpretation of a causal relationship
probably result from the use of routine cytogenetic investiga-
tions in patients with leukaemia or lymphoma, which exag-
gerate the chance association of KS and leukaemia. The lack
Cancer iniden

of an increased risk of leukaemia in the present study
is
consistent with a cytogenetic study of 1200 consecutive male
patients with suspected leukaemia in which only one case of
KS was found (Horsman et al., 1987).
Myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS)
have
recently
been
reported
in
association
with KS
(Groupe
Francais
de
Cytogenetique Hematologique, 1988; Yamauchi, 1993). We
found one case of MDS (refractory anaemia with ring sidero-
blasts) in a 62-year-old man. The case
is not included in
Table
II because the expected number could not be cal-
culated owing to the lack of routine notification of MDS to
the Cancer Registry.
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate was found in one patient
with a 47,XXY karyotype and previous exposure of the
prostate to therapeutic radiation. Studies of employees in the
atomic industry have shown a statistically significant associa-
tion between prostate cancer and external radiation exposure
(Fraser et al., 1993). Despite the fact that prostate cancer is
one of the most common neoplasms in men, we are aware of
only three cases with KS, each one associated with unusual
characteristics - karyotype mosaic (Arduino, 1%7), multiple
malignancies
(Pienkos
and
Meisner,
1991)
or
radiation
exposure (present report) - and this may indicate a lower risk
of prostate cancer in men with KS. No consistent association
has been detected between the risk of prostate cancer and the
serum
concentrations
of gonadotropins
and
testosterone
(Andersson et al.. 1993), but the persistently lower level of
testosterone in men with KS may be a protective factor.
The four cases of mediastinal tumours contrast with only
0.06 expected and a relative risk of 67. All four cases were
primary mediastinal germ
cell tumours (PMGCT), which
normally constitute only 10% of mediastinal tumours (Davis
et
al.,
1987).
This indicates that the risk of PMGCT
is
increased by several hundred fold. Although the relative risk
of PMGCr in men with KS is very high, the lifetime risk is
only about 1% because of the rarity of this tumour type. The
four cases of PMGCT all occurred in 47,XXY men, and were
all
of
non-seminomatous
histology
and
restricted
to
adolescents and young adults, which is in accordance with
the previous reports of KS and PMGC[ (Hasle et al., 1992).
Of the two brain tumours, one was a possible germinoma
of the pineal gland. In contrast to the dominance of non-
seminomatous
histology
in PMGCT.
all of the reported
cerebral germ cell tumours associated with KS have been of
the germinoma type (Arens et al., 1988).
The genesis of extragonadal germ cell tumours is supposed
to be related to incomplete migration of the pnrmordial germ
cells from the endoderm of the yolk sac to the gonads.
resulting in later malignant transformation to midline germ
cell tumours along the urogenital ridge. The more frequent
neoplastic transformation of germ cells in KS might be a
result of the disarrangement of the hormonal milieu With
persistent elevated gonadotropin levels. However, it remains
puzzling why
the
increased
risk
of germ
cell
tumours
observed with KS is apparently exclusively related to non-
seminomatous neoplasms of mediastinal location and per-
haps to germinoma of the pineal gland.
We found two carcinomas of the gall bladder or bile duct
(relative risk = 9.7) and three sarcomas (relative risk = 3.7).
A search of the literature from 1966 onwards showed no
reports
of carcinoma
of
the
gall
bladder
or
sarcoma
associated with KS, and the present finding may be a chance
association.
A few reports have descrnbed the occurrence of multiple
malignancies in patients with KS (Coley et al.. 1971; Pienkos
and Meisner. 1991). We found three patients with two neo-
plasms; one of these (the prostate cancer) was considered to
be therapy related. thus leaving two persons each one with
two primary tumours. One had bilateral acoustic neurilem-
momas and 11 years later a sarcoma; the second had bladder
cancer and a year later skin cancer. These data do not
support
the hypothesis of an
increased
risk
of multiple
primary tumours in men with KS.
In conclusion,
the study found no
overall
increase
in
cancer incidence. The nrsk of male genital cancer may even be
decreased. There is a considerably elevated nrsk of medias-
tinal germ cell tumours occurring in the period from early
adolescence until the age of 30. Physicians caring for young
men with KS who present with respiratory symptoms should
be aware of this risk and make appropriate examinations for
this potentially curable tumour. No routine cancer screening
seems to be justified in men with KS.

Complex Gene Expression in Primary Sensory 
Neurons, Satellite Cells, and Schwann Cells of Mice 
in Response to Acute but Not Latent Herpes Simplex 
Virus Infection In Vivo 
By Rosemarie A. Pereira, David C. Tscharke,

SA 5000, Australia 
Summary 
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) deficiency is typical of almost all resident cells in normal 
neural tissue. However, CD8 + T cells, which recognize antigenic peptides in the context of 
class I MHC molecules, are known to mediate clearance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from 
spinal ganglia of experimentally infected mice, leading to the hypothesis that class I expression 
in the peripheral nervous system must be upregulated in response to HSV infection. In addressing 
this hypothesis it is shown, in BALB/c (H-2 a) mice, that normally deficient class I transcripts 
transiently accumulate in peripheral nerve Schwann cells, ganglionic satellite ceUs, and primary 
sensory neurons, indicating that in each of these cell types class I expression is regulated at the 
transcriptional level in vivo. Furthermore, for 3-4 wk after infection, H-2Kd/D a antigens are 
expressed by satellite and Schwann cells but not neurons, suggesting additional posttranscriptional 
regulation of class I synthesis in neurons. Alternatively, the class I RNAs induced in neurons 
may not be derived from classical class I genes. Factors regulating H-2 class I expression emanate 
from within infected ganglia, probably from infected neurons themselves. However, induction 
of class I molecules was not maintained during latency, when viral gene expression in neurons 
is restricted to a single region within the virus repeats. These data have implications for the 
long-term survival of cells in HSV-infected neural tissue. 
ter cutaneous inoculation, HSV replicates in epidermal 
cells and concurrently invades the peripheral nervous 
system (PNS) 1, where primary sensory neurons are the virus' 
main target (1). Productive infection of sensory neurons 
generates the potential for lethal spread of virus throughout 
the nervous system but, in immunocompetent hosts, viral 
replication is usually terminated rapidly, by timely develop- 
ment of an adaptive immune response (2). After recovery from 
primary infection, elimination of HSV from the PNS is not 
complete. Rather, viral DNA sequences persist in a propor- 
tion of neurons in a latent, nonreplicating state, forming a 
reservoir from which infection can periodically reactivate (3). 
During latency, viral gene expression is repressed, with the 
exception of a single region within the virus repeats (4). Puta- 
tive translation products of latency-associated transcripts (LATs) 
have, to date, been described only in experimental models

latency-associated transcript; TK, thymidine kinase. 
of latency in vitro (5) and the function of LATs remains poorly 
understood. 
The mechanisms responsible for controlling productive in- 
fection and maintaining latency have been studied intensively, 
mostly in well characterized experimental models (for a re- 
view see reference 2). MHC-linked genes influence the severity 
of herpes simplex (6), in line with the established role of T 
lymphocytes as mediators of recovery from acute infection. 
It is interesting to note that the mechanisms responsible for 
clearance of infectious virus from the skin and the nervous 
system appear to differ. Resolution of cutaneous lesions de- 
pends primarily on CD4 + (MHC class II restricted) CTLs 
and/or a delayed type hypersensitivity response (7), whereas 
CD8 + cells play a pivotal role in clearance of HSV from the 
PNS (8). The mechanisms of action of antiviral CD8 + cells 
in the peripheral or central nervous systems (CNS) have not 
been determined, but two lines of evidence suggest that the 
classic paradigm for control of viral infections- lysis of in- 
fected cells by CD8 + CTLs-is not satisfactory for neuronal 
targets. First, neural tissue is sheltered from the immune system

in several ways, and prominent among these is deficient ex- 
pression of MFIC molecules by almost all resident cells (for 
a review see reference 9). Class I MHC gene products are 
required for presentation of antigenic peptides to CD8 + T 
lymphocytes, induding classical CTLs (10), from which it 
follows that virus-infected ceils must synthesize class I mole- 
cules in order to be lysed by CTLs. In the CNS, several neu- 
rotropic viruses are known to induce MFIC class I antigen 
synthesis in glial cells, but in this respect, neurons are notably 
resistant (11). It has been proposed that neurons have evolved 
a mechanism for escaping CTL attack based on downregula- 
tion of class I synthesis, allowing nonlytic antiviral mecha- 
nisms to predominate (12, 13). Second, we previously showed 
that treatment of HSV-infected mice with anti-CD8 enhances 
neuronal destruction and conversely, survival of viral antigen- 
positive neurons is dependent on a CD8 + T cell-mediated 
response (8). The prominent role played by CD8 + cells in 
clearance of infectious virus from spinal ganglia challenges 
the view that PNS tissues are entirely MHC deficient, be- 
cause irrespective of their mechanism of action, CD8 + T 
ceils must be stimulated at the site of infection in a class I-re- 
stricted manner. These considerations led to the hypothesis 
that synthesis of class I molecules by resident cells of the PNS 
is modulated in response to HSV infection. To address this 
hypothesis, we examined the effect of HSV on class I RNA 
and antigen synthesis in spinal ganglia and peripheral nerves 
of experimentally infected mice. 
Two features of the experimental system used in these studies 
require introduction. First, HSV was introduced into the PNS 
of mice by retrograde axonal transport along spinal nerves, 
after inoculation of virus into flank skin (14); the inocula- 
tion procedure caused minimal disruption to the physical in- 
tegrity of spinal ganglia. Second, in some experiments, mice 
were infected with an HSV thymidine kinase (TK) deletion 
mutant that cannot replicate its DNA within the PNS and 
therefore cannot spread from cell to cell. In this way it was 
possible to strictly confine I-ISV to neurons directly inner- 
vating the site of inoculation and restrict the number of viral 
lytic genes expressed, in an attempt to determine whether 
infected neurons participate directly in the afferent arm of 
the neuroimmunological response. 
Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed 
that class I transcripts were present in low but detectable 
amounts in PNS tissues of uninfected mice. However, after 
inoculation of HSV into flank skin, heterogenous and ma- 
ture class I RNAs transiently increased in abundance in sat- 
ellite cells, Schwann cells, and primary sensory neurons, sug- 
gesting transcriptional regulation of class I expression in each 
of these cell types in vivo in response to acute ganglionic 
infection with HSV. Classical class I antigens (FI-2Ka/D a) 
were detected in satellite and Schwann cells, but not in neurons, 
suggesting that there may be an additional block in class I 
synthesis at the posttranscriptional level in neurons. Alterna- 
tively, the RNAs detected in neurons may not have been de- 
rived from classical class I genes. Factors regulating H-2 class 
I expression emanated from within infected ganglia, prob- 
ably from infected neurons. However, latent infection of 
neurons, during which viral gene expression is restricted to 
a single region of unknown function within the virus repeats, 
did not maintain the stimulus for class I expression. 
Materials and Methods 
Viruses. In most experiments, mice were infected with HSV 
type 1, strain SC16, a well-characterized isolate that has been shown 
to be neuroinvasive in several mouse strains (15). Where indicated, 
mice were infected with HSV type 1, strain TKDM21, which has 
an 816-bp deletion in the TK gene (16). As a consequence of the 
TK deletion, TKDM21 cannot replicate in neurons. Strains SC16 
and TKDM21 were grown and titrated in Veto cells and stored 
at -70~ until required. When required, inocula were inactivated 
by exposure to ultraviolet light (17). 
Infection of Mic~ Adult female BALB/c (H-2 d) and C3H (H-2 k) 
mice (Specific Pathogen-Free facility, Animal Resource Centre, 
Perth, Western Australia) were used at greater than 8 wk of age. 
Characteristics of the zosteriform model used in these experiments 
have been described in detail previously (14). Briefly, after depila- 
tion with Nair (Carter-Wallace, New South Wales, Australia), a 
small patch of skin on the left flank, innervated by the eighth 
through tenth thoracic dorsal root ganglia (T8-T10) was scarified 
with a 27-gauge needle through a 10 #1 drop of virus suspension. 
In this system, it was shown that infectious virus and viral an- 
tigens are cleared from ganglia ""~7 d after inoculation with 1.5 
x 10 s PFU HSV-1 strain SC16 (14, 18). 
Immunohistochemistry. H-2 antigens were detected on acetone- 
fixed frozen sections (6 #m) of pooled ganglia (>30). Biotinylated 
monoclonal anti-H-2Kd/D d primary antibodies were used as 
follows: HB79 (American Type Culture Collection, RockviUe, MD) 
or 34-7-23S (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada) at dilutions of 1:20 and 
1:10, respectively. Rather than direct detection of avidin-HRP 
(1:400) binding at this stage it was found that sensitivity could 
be increased by reacting bound avidin-HRP with rabbit antiavidin 
(1:50) followed by swine anti-rabbit Igs (1:25) and finally, rabbit 
peroxidase antiperoxidase complex (1:200) (all reagents from 
Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark, unless stated otherwise). All anti- 
bodies were diluted in ""Iris saline buffer (TSB) (pH 7.4) containing 
10% BSA, 5% normal mouse serum, and 5% normal swine serum. 
Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37~ 
and sec- 
tions were washed twice with TSB (pH 7.4) between steps. Bound 
antibody was detected with 3,Y-diaminobenzidine containing 0.1% 
H202. HSV antigens were detected as described previously (18). 
Nucleic Acid Probes. pRK1 and pTK were constructed by sub- 
cloning the BamHI-EcoKI fragment of pUC-H-2K d (19) into 
Bluescribe M13- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pGEM4Z (Pro- 
mega, Madison, WI), respectively. Transcription ofpRK1 and pTK 
from the T7 promoter generated sense and antisense H-2K d 
mRNA riboprobes, respectively, pSLAT2 (20), containing a 1.6-kb 
PstI-HpaI subfragment of HSV-I BamHI B (strain SC16), was used 
to generate riboprobes for detection of LATs. Plasmids were linear- 
iced by restriction enzyme digestion and gel purified to remove 
uncut templates before transcription, which was done according 
to Promega recommendations with the following modifications: 
12 #m-rUTP, 0.085 #m [32p]rUTP, and 250 #m digoxigenin-11- 
rUTP (Boehringer Mannheim, GmBH, Mannheim, Germany). The 
following plasmids were used to make DNA probes for Northern 
blot analyses: pRK1, containing full-length H-2K d cDNA (see 
above); pGEM3fl2(A), containing/32-microglobulin (B2m) cDNA, 
derived from pBReB4 (21) and pAL41 (22), containing murine fl 
actin cDNA. Inserts were purified by gel electrophoresis and la- 
beled with 32p to a specific activity of 1-2 x 109 dpm/#g, using 
a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim).

MHC Class I Induction in Peripheral Nervous Systems of HSV-infected Mice 
Northern Blot Analysis. Total RNA was extracted from spleens 
or pooled ganglia and analyzed by Northern blotting using stan- 
dard protocols (23). Filters were washed at a final stringency of 
Tm -10~ (i.e., 10~ below the 50% hybrid melting tempera- 
ture) and bound probe was detected by Phosphorlmage analysis 
(Phosphorlmager 400; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Bands 
were quantified relative to uninfected ganglionic RNA, using Im- 
ageQuant software (v3.0; Molecular Dynamics). In studies on the 
kinetics of MHC induction (see Fig. 2), after analysis for H-2K d, 
filters were stripped and reprobed for fl2m mRNA and finally, Im- 
ageQuant values were normalized after reprobing the filters for tran- 
scripts of a cellular housekeeping gene, mouse fl-actin. 
In situ Hybridization. Nonisotopic detection of class I RNAs 
and HSV-1 LATs was done on paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate 
(PLP) fixed tissue sections (5 #m) as described (20), with the fol- 
lowing modifications: (a) tissues were refixed in 4% paraformalde- 
hyde in PBS; (b) H-2 class I hybridization was done at 55~ (Tm 
- 30~ 
with a stringent posthybridization wash at 53~ (Tm 
-13~ 
for 15 min; and (c) LAT probes were hybridized at 65~ 
(Tin -26.5~ 
with a stringent posthybridization wash at 75~ 
(Tin -5~ 
Tissue blocks each contained 30-60 ganglia. 
Results 
HSV Infection Increases MHC Class I Transcription in the 
PNS. 
The effect of HSV on MHC class I transcription was 
initially investigated by Northern blot analysis of RNA ex- 
tracted from 60-120 spinal ganglia (left T6-L1) removed from 
BALB/c mice either before infection, or 9 d after flank in- 
oculation with HSV-1, strain SC16 (Fig. 1). Heterogenous 
and mature class I RNAs were present at low but detectable 
levels in uninfected ganglia which, to our knowledge, is the 
first demonstration of class I RNAs in normal adult neural 
tissue. 9 d after infection, mRNA levels had increased fivefold 
compared with uninfected ganglia, without alteration of the 
ratio between the heterogenous and mature species (,x,1:10). 
The kinetics of induction of class I heavy and light (fl2m) 
chain RNA synthesis were determined by studying RNA 
samples extracted from BALB/c ganglia 5, 11, and 17 d after 
infection (Fig. 2). As bases for comparison, RNA was also 
extracted from spinal ganglia and spleens of uninfected animals. 
Class I heavy chain and/32m mRNAs accumulated progres- 
sively in a coordinated manner for at least 17 d after infec- 
tion, by which time the levels of these transcripts in ganglia 
exceeded those present in spleens of uninfected animals. We 
reasoned that accumulation of class I pre-mRNAs in the PNS 
after infection with HSV, together with the stable pre- 
mRNA/mRNA ratio, might indicate enhanced transcription 
of class I genes in resident neural cells, infiltrating cells, or 
both. This issue was addressed by studying the cellular loca- 
tion of MHC transcripts by in situ hybridization. 
Neurons Synthesize Class I RNA Molecules. Spinal gan- 
glia (left T6-L1) were removed from groups of uninfected, 
acutely infected, and latently infected BALB/c mice and PLP 
fixed sections (5/~m) were hybridized with a strand-specific 
digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe generated from full-length 
H-2K d cDNA, under conditions designed to detect class I 
RNA transcripts in situ. Class I molecules were generally 
not detected in uninfected ganglia (Fig. 3 a), though in some 
reactions very weak hybridization was observed in occasional 
Schwann cell nuclei. Schwann cells may therefore be the main 
source of the low level of class I transcripts detected in unin- 
fected PNS tissue by Northern hybridization. As early as 3 d 
after flank inoculation with 1.5 x 105 PFU HSV-1 strain

SC16, strong hybridization was detected in the nuclei and 
cytoplasms of numerous satellite cells, Schwann cells, and pri- 
mary sensory neurons (Fig. 3 b). On days 5-8, confluent 
staining of neurons and satellite cells was observed in many 
ganglia (e.g., Fig. 3 c) and staining of Schwann cell nuclei 
was widespread (e.g., Fig. 3 d). The extent of HSV infection 
6 and 8 d after infection was estimated by staining ganglionic 
sections for viral antigens and, in concordance with previous 
studies (18), <10% of neurons were viral antigen positive 
on day 6 and acute infection had resolved by day 8 (data not 
shown). 
In the model system described here, HSV is known to 
spread, via neural connections, from the inoculated neuroder- 
matomes (T9/T10) to adjacent ipsilateral areas of the PNS 
(e.g., T11-T13) but, in immunocompetent animals, con- 
tralateral spread of virus is minimal (24). These characteris- 
tics of the model were used to address the issue of whether 
MHC induction is regulated by local or other factors. First, 
in situ hybridization was used to compare ipsilateral and con- 
tralateral ganglia from a group of mice infected 7 d earlier 
with SC16. Despite extensive induction of class I RNAs in 
mid-thoracic ganglia on the side of inoculation (Fig. 4 a), 
in contralateral ganglia the H-2K a probe hybridized weakly 
and to only a minority of cells (Fig. 4 b), suggesting local- 
ized rather than systemic MHC regulation. Second, ganglia 
directly innervating the inoculation site (T9) were compared 
with neighboring ipsilateral ganglia (T13), which receive virus 
via neural pathways. 30 ganglia from each spinal level were 
removed 5 and 8 d after infection, pooled, and tested for the 
presence of class I transcripts in situ. Temporally, MHC in- 
duction at T13 lagged T9 (Fig. 4, c-J~, presumably reflecting 
the time taken for transneuronal transfer of virus within the 
PNS (25). Nonetheless, widespread appearance of class I tran- 
scripts on day 8 in satellite cells and neurons at T13 (Fig. 
4 J~ strongly implied local MHC regulation in response to 
spread of virus to this site, rather than retrograde axonal trans-

HSV Infection Induces Classical MHC Class I Antigen Expres- 
sion in Satellite and Schwann Cells but Not Neurons. 
Numerous 
immunohistochemical studies have indicated that CNS neurons 
lack the ability to express MHC class I genes in vivo (for 
a review see reference 9), even in response to viral infections, 
including herpes simplex (26). In view of the readily detect- 
able HSV-induced synthesis of class I RNAs in primary sen- 
sory neurons and other resident cells of the PNS (see above), 
induction of classical H-2Ka/D d antigens was studied im- 
munohistochemically in dorsal root ganglia and proximal 
spinal nerve trunks (left T8-T13), using two unrelated pri- 
mary antibodies. In uninfected mice, H-2Kd/D d antigens 
could not be detected, despite the presence of low levels of 
class I mRNAs in the PNS (see above). However, widespread 
class I antigen induction was detected, by two anti-H-2Kd/D d 
antibodies (HB79 and 34-7-23S), in ganglia and nerves of 
mice infected 10 d earlier with strain SC16 (Fig. 5). Staining 
was prominent in satellite cells which surround primary sen- 
sory neurons and peripheral nerve Schwann cells (e.g., HB79, 
Fig. 5 a), but no staining was observed in neurons. Staining 
was H-2 a specific; primary antibodies did not react with

MHC Class I Induction in Peripheral Nervous Systems of HSV-infected Mice 
ganglia from infected C3H (H-2 k) mice (e.g., HB79, Fig. 
5 b). No staining was seen after inoculation with 107 PFU 
UV-inactivated SC16 (Fig. 5 c), from which we concluded 
that viral infection, rather than the trauma of cutaneous in- 
oculation, was the stimulus for class I expression. Thus, clas- 
sical MHC class I proteins are expressed in satellite and 
Schwann cells of the PNS in response to HSV infection but, 
like their CNS counterparts, PNS neurons are resistant to 
MHC antigen induction. 
A characteristic feature of the experimental model used in 
these experiments is delivery of virus to ganglia by retrograde 
axonal transport, which initially restricts viral access to neurons 
alone. Infectious virus and viral antigen positive neurons can 
first be detected in this system 3 d after inoculation of the 
flank (18), at which time induction of MHC class I mRNAs 
could be demonstrated readily (Fig. 3 b). These data impli- 
cate infected sensory neurons as the initial source of the local 
stimulus for MHC class I induction and this hypothesis was 
addressed by infecting mice with a mutant strain of HSV-1, 
TKDM21 (16). This virus has an 816-bp deletion in the TK 
region of the genome, which selectively eliminates viral DNA 
replication in neurons compared with epidermal cells (16), 
thereby preventing cell to cell spread of HSV in the PNS. 
In ganglia removed from BALB/c mice 10 d after flank in- 
oculation with 107 PFU of strain TKDM21, immuno- 
histochemical staining with anti-H-2Kd/D a (HB79) dis- 
dosed widespread expression of MHC class I genes in satellite 
cells (Fig. 5 d) and Schwann cells, despite the restricted na- 
ture of the infection. 
Class I Synthesis Is Transient and Not Stimulated by Latent 
Infection. Avoidance of effective immune surveillance is an 
implicit feature of virus persistence and several strategies used 
by viruses to evade the immune response have been described. 
Prominent among these are (a) downregulation of normal 
antigen presentation mechanisms (27) and (b) infection of 
cells, especially neurons, that appear to be deficient in consti- 
tutive MHC class I expression (e.g., 28, and this report). The 
function of HSV LATs is unknown, and we were interested 
to determine whether this restricted form of viral gene ex- 
pression was sufficient to maintain the stimulus for enhanced 
MHC class I expression in the PNS. Spinal ganglia from a 
group of BALB/c mice killed 400 d after infection (tissue 
PS320, kindly provided by P. Speck, Cambridge University, 
Cambridge, UK) were tested for the presence of class I KNAs 
and HSV-1 LATs by in situ hybridization. Class I transcripts 
were not detected whereas, in the same tissue, a substantial 
proportion (>10%) of neurons were LAT + (data not 
shown). 
To characterize the transient nature of class I antigen in- 
duction, H-2Kd/D a antigen synthesis was studied in 
BALB/c ganglia removed at various times after cutaneous in- 
oculation with 3 x 107 PFU HSV-1, strain TKDM21. In 
thoracic ganglia pooled from groups of six mice killed 10, 
17, 21, and 27 d after midflank inoculation, immuno- 
histochemical staining (using HB79) of satellite and Schwann 
cells increased in intensity up to and including day 17, declined 
by day 21, and was undetectable by day 27. On day 27, PLP- 
fixed ganglia from an additional group of concomitantly in- 
fected mice were paraffin embedded and sections (5 #m) were 
examined for HSV-1 LATs by in situ hybridization (Fig. 6). 
LAT § neurons were readily detected, demonstrating the 
presence of TKDM21 latent infection at this time point. 
Overall, these data indicate that (a) MHC class I antigens 
are detectable for at least 15 d after viral antigen synthesis 
ceases; (b) the PNS returns to a state of relative MHC 
deficiency; and (c) the restricted viral transcriptional activity 
associated with established latency does not maintain the 
stimulus for H-2 antigen expression. 
Discussion 
In previous studies, MHC-linked genes and CD8 + T cells 
were shown to strongly influence the severity of HSV infec-

tion of the PNS (6, 8), despite the MHC-deficient nature 
of resident cells in normal neural tissue. We hypothesized 
that class I expression in the PNS must be upregulated in 
response to HSV infection and, in the present study, this was 
shown to be the case. HSV transiently stimulated MHC class 
I gene expression in satellite and Schwann cells by a regula- 
tory mechanism that acted at the transcriptional level, as de- 
termined by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridiza- 
tion. Satellite cells, which are the most prominent cell type 
in spinal ganglia, are counterparts of CNS macroglia, which 
include oligodendrocytes and astrocytes; astrocytes are known 
to be able to stimulate CD8 + T cells in vitro (29). Satellite 
cells are not permissive for HSV replication, but abortive in- 
fection, based on electron microscopy studies, has been de- 
scribed in vivo (30, 31). Together, the properties of satellite 
and Schwann cells and their relationship to CNS glia, sug- 
gest they may have a role in presenting HSV antigens to 
CD8 § T cells in the PNS. A study of their immunological 
properties in vitro may shed further light on this issue. 
Primary sensory neurons, like neurons in the CNS, appear 
to be resistant to induction of MHC antigens in vivo. This 
conclusion is based on failure to detect classical class I an- 
tigens in neurons in HSV-infected spinal ganglia, despite wide- 
spread H-2Kd/D a antigen expression in neighboring satel- 
lite cells, with the caveat that the sensitivity of class I antigen 
detection in this and previous studies is unknown. The iden- 
tity of the transcripts detected in neurons is a focus of future 
work. It is possible that they are classical class I mRNAs, 
induced in neurons by the same mechanisms responsible for 
MHC class I induction in satellite cells and that a posttran- 
scriptional block in synthesis, transport, or processing of class 
I proteins is responsible for deficient H-2Ka/D a expression. 
In line with this hypothesis, a defect in peptide transport, 
preventing efficient assembly of mature class I molecules and 
transport to the cell surface, has been described in a neuronal 
cell line in vitro (32). However, it has been suggested that 
MHC class I gene expression in the nervous system is con- 
trolled differently among different cell types (33). Two jux- 
taposed cis-acting regulatory elements upstream of H-2 class 
I coding sequences have been identified, one of which is an 
IFN response consensus sequence (34, 35). In the presence 
of y-IFN, the regulatory sequences have been shown to en- 
hance MHC class I promoter activity in transfected primary 
cultures of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, but not CNS 
neurons; in neurons, y-IFN failed to induce a DNA binding 
factor associated with enhancement of transcription (33). Con- 
sequently, the class I RNAs detected in neurons may not be 
derived from classical class I genes. Several nonclassical class 
I gene products, which lack the polymorphism characteristic 
of classical MHC antigens, have been identified in mice, rats, 
and humans, and a study of the rat MHC locus suggests that 
many more nonclassical molecules await discovery (36). The 
role of nonclassical MHC class I molecules is poorly under- 
stood, though it has been suggested that these molecules might 
act as restriction elements in association with invariant anti- 
genic determinants on ubiquitously encountered foreign pro- 
teins (37). DNA sequence analysis of several routine nonclas- 
sical class I genes has revealed a high degree of similarity with 
classical genes, with very long segments of identity, particu- 
larly in exon 3. By design, the cDNA probe used in this study 
could not distinguish classical from nonclassical MHC class 
I transcripts. Whereas probes could be constructed to distin- 
guish, in situ, between classical H-2K/D transcripts and nu- 
cleic acid sequences unique to those nonclassical genes for 
which DNA sequence information is available, novel ap- 
proaches will be required to determine whether neurons re- 
spond to infection by upregulating the synthesis of as yet 
unidentified nonclassical class I molecules. 
The source of the stimulus for class I mRNA and antigen 
synthesis merits discussion. Class I expression was anatomi- 
cally restricted to ganglia reached by virus, either directly, 
by retrograde axonal transfer from skin and or indirectly, via 
neural connections. Thus, the stimulus for upregulation of 
class I synthesis most probably emanates from within the 
infected ganglion. Class I molecules were present in ganglia 
(e.g., T13) free of histologically evident infiltrating leuko- 
cytes, suggesting that MHC regulation is independent of 
inflammation. Although the number of viral genes expressed 
by TK- strains of HSV in the PNS is severely restricted 
(38), H-2Kd/D a antigen expression was stimulated by pe- 
ripheral inoculation with TKDM21, which cannot replicate 
on reaching the PNS and is unable to escape from neurons. 
These data implicate neurons as the initial source of the 
stimulus for upregulation of MHC class I, and the previous 
suggestion that neurons may synthesize 3'-IFN or related mol- 
ecules may be relevant in this respect (39). 
MHC class I transcripts were detected in neurons for up 
to 2 wk after recovery from acute infection. It is not known 
whether prolonged MHC induction is a general feature of 
acute viral infections of the nervous system but it is intriguing 
to speculate that this pattern may be a unique feature of the 
transition between the productive and latent phases of herpes 
simplex. MHC class I induction was not maintained during 
latency, when, judged by the most sensitive methods avail- 
able, viral gene expression is restricted to a single region within 
the virus repeats. Putative translation products of LATs have 
been described only in vitro (5) and the function of LATs 
remains unknown. Further advances in our understanding 
of the latency-associated transcription unit may help to de- 
termine why latent gene expression does not stimulate class 
I MHC expression. This issue has broad implications because 
viruses, including HSV, have long been suspects in the eti- 
ology of demyelinating diseases (40) and dysmyelination is 
a known consequence of prolonged, aberrant expression of 
class I molecules in the nervous system (41). It is tempting 
to speculate that neurological damage might be caused by 
inappropriate class I induction in response to latent viral gene 
expression, particularly in view of the fact that HSV can per- 
sist in the CNS, as well as the PNS (42). The experimental 
system described in this report may be useful in addressing 
this hypothesis, because HSV is itself, a useful neurotropic 
vector (43) into which expression cassettes containing, for 
instance, MHC or other immune response genes, could be 
inserted under the control of the LAT promoter.

High serum procalcitonin concentrations in patients
with sepsis and infection
High 
concentrations 
of 
calcitonin-like
immunoreactivity have been found in the blood of
patients with various extrathyroid diseases. By
means of a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for
calcitonin precursors, we have measured serum
concentrations of procalcitonin in patients with
various bacterial and viral infections.
79 children (newborn to age 12 years) in hospital
with suspected 
infections 
were investigated
prospectively. 19 patients with severe bacterial
infections had very high serum concentrations of
procalcitonin at diagnosis (range 6-53 ng/mL) in
comparison with 21 children found to have no signs
of infection (baseline concentrations <0&middot;1 
ng/mL).
Serum procalcitonin values decreased rapidly during
antibiotic therapy. 11 patients with peripheral
bacterial colonisation or local infections without
invasive sepsis and 18 (86%) of 21 patients with viral
infections had concentrations within or slightly
above the normal range (0&middot;1-1
&middot;5 ng/mL). Among 9
severely burned patients studied in an intensive care
unit, the post-traumatic course of procalcitonin
concentrations (range 0&middot;1-120 ng/mL) was closely
related to infectious complications and acute septic
episodes. Concentrations of mature calcitonin were
normal in all subjects, whatever procalcitonin
concentrations were found.
Concentrations of a substance immunologically
identical to procalcitonin are raised during septic
conditions. Serum concentrations seem to be
correlated with the severity of microbial invasion.

Introduction
Increased production of calcitonin by medullary thyroid
carcinoma (MTC) is well known, and serum calcitonin is
used as a marker of this cancer. High serum concentrations
of calcitonin-like immunoreactivity have also been reported
in various extrathyroid disorders, including many cancers,
acute and chronic inflammatory disease of the lung, acute
pancreatitis, renal failure, benign liver disease, and
fulminating infantile meningococcaemia.1-9 The presence of
several circulating immunoreactive forms of calcitonin and
its precursors in MTC patients has been shown by several
groups ’11,10-13 but the nature of circulating immunoreactive
calcitonin species in other disorders remains unknown.
However, Ghillani and colleagues8 lately showed that,
unlike MTC, which produces both precursors and mature
hormones, most of the extrathyroid diseases produce
calcitonin precursors in the absence of mature hormone.
We have investigated calcitonin species in patients with
severe bacterial infections and sepsis.
Patients and methods
Two groups of patients were studied. The first comprised 79
newborn and older infants and children admitted to a paediatric unit
with suspected infections (table) and the second included 9 severely
burned patients admitted to an intensive care unit (burn injuries
16-80% of body surface area). Blood samples were centrifuged for
15 min at 1500 g and serum was stored at -20&deg;C until analysis.
Procalcitonin 
was 
measured 
with 
a 
monoclonal
immunoradiometric assay (m-IRMA).8 This assay uses two
monoclonal antibodies, one directed against residues 96-106 of
procalcitonin, as the capture antibody, and one recognising residues
70-76, as the tracer antibody (fig 1). This assay has a detection limit
of 100 pg/mL. Serum calcitonin was measured with a commercial
m-IRMA (CIS Bio-International, Gif sur Yvette, France) which
is specific for mature calcitonin and has a sensitivity limit of
10 pg/mL. Circulating immunoreactive forms of calcitonin
were analysed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). After partial purification on a Sep-Pak
cartridge, serum was injected into a C 18-Nucleosil (Macherey-
Nagel, Diiren, Germany) column equilibrated with 0-1% (by
volume) trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at room
temperature and at a flow rate of 1 mL per min with a 60 min
gradient of 20-70% acetonitrile in 0-1% trifluoracetic acid.
CLINICAL DATA FOR STUDY CHILDREN
Immunoreactivity of the fractions was tested by four assays: the two
described above; a radioimmunoassay based on a polyclonal goat
antiserum directed against residues 1-57 of procalcitonin, which
recognises both procalcitonin and the putative cleavage peptide

Fig 2 shows the 
distribution 
of procalcitonin
concentrations in the five subgroups of children with and
without infection. Procalcitonin was undetectable (<0-1 1
ng/mL) in 21 children without infection. At the time of
diagnosis, 10 newborn infants and 9 older infants or children
with severe bacterial infection (100%) had high serum
concentrations of procalcitonin (6-53 ng/mL). Antibiotic
treatment rapidly decreased procalcitonin concentrations
(days 2-6 of treatment). Among the 5 infants and children
with locoregional infection and the 6 newborn infants with
skin bacterial colonisation and no sepsis, procalcitonin
concentrations did not exceed 1-5 ng/mL (0-3-1-5 ng/mL).
Of the 21 patients with viral infections, 18 (86%) had values
within or slightly above the normal range (maximum 1-4
ng/mL); 2 children with gastroenteritis (1 coronavirus, 1
rotavirus) had values of 3-5 ng/mL and 8-0 ng/mL, and a
child with acute hepatitis A had concentrations of 17 ng/mL
on admission and 2 ng/mL on day 8.
Serum procalcitonin concentrations varied widely among
the 9 burns patients from 0- to 120 ng/mL. Three
subgroups were identified according to the time course of
procalcitonin changes (fig 3). 2 patients had peak

procalcitonin concentrations of 2 ng/mL and 3 ng/mL
within 3 days of the burn; concentrations then fell
progressively to normal (subgroup I). These patients did not
have any infectious complications during the hospital stay. 3
patients (subgroup II) had higher values, up to 19 ng/mL.
The peak concentrations were found at the onset of sepsis,
confirmed by clinical and microbiological signs. In
subgroup III, serum concentrations of 3 patients were high
1 day after the burn (14 ng/mL, 21 ng/mL, and 78 ng/mL)
and continued to rise during the next few days, during acute
septic episodes. 1 of these patients, who had severe
infectious complications (E coli positive blood culture on day
4, septic shock on day 6, Pseudomonas aerwinosa positive
culture on day 20), had high concentrations of procalcitonin
in all serum samples; the highest value (120 ng/mL) was
measured during septic shock. The 4th patient in subgroup
III had toxic shock syndrome 18 days after the bum, and
procalcitonin reached a maximum of 70 ng/mL at that time.
Only 1 burns patient (subgroup II) died (pulmonary
embolism 57 days after injury). Concentrations of mature
calcitonin were normal at all times in both burns patients
and children.

Analysis of serum extracts by reverse-phase HPLC
showed a major peak eluting at 37-39 min, as detected by
several immunoassays (fig 4). It is likely that this
immunoreactive peak corresponded to the whole molecule
of procalcitonin. Two other small peaks detected in some
samples could not be identified. Calcitonin was consistently
undetectable by a specific m-IRMA.
Discussion
Serum calcitonin-like immunoreactivity has been
reported in various extrathyroid diseases.1-9 Our study
shows that 
serum concentrations of a substance
immunologically identical to procalcitonin increase at the
onset of infections. In addition, serum concentrations of this
substance seemed to be correlated with the severity of the
infection. In all but 2 children with procalcitonin
concentrations above 5 ng/mL, the diagnosis of severe
bacterial sepsis was confirmed microbiologically. The study
of bums patients suggests that bum injuries may lead to
moderate systemic release of procalcitonin. However,
among these patients, very high peak concentrations of
procalcitonin were associated with septic complications,
although no direct correlation was found between the
post-bum course of the procalcitonin concentrations and the
size of the bum or pulmonary injury. The correlation of
procalcitonin with the severity of infection was confirmed by
findings of serum concentrations up to 200 ng/mL (2000
times the normal value) in patients with septic shock (data
not shown). Antibiotic treatment lowered procalcitonin
rapidly. By contrast, high circulating procalcitonin
concentrations persisted in 1 burns patient who had
overwhelming microbial invasion and a long septic episode.
Do the procalcitonin molecules originate from the thyroid
gland or from other tissues in these patients? Thyroid
C-cells do not seem to be the production site of
procalcitonin; indeed, 1 burns patient who had undergone
thyroidectomy 2 years earlier had high procalcitonin values
but no secretion of mature calcitonin. The finding that
procalcitonin was detectable in the absence of mature
calcitonin shows that the procalcitonin-producing cells are
unable to process this precursor form to the mature
hormone. MTC 
are capable of producing and secreting all
the biosynthetic pathway products.12-14 Pulmonary
neuroendocrine cells in the bronchial epithelium have been
reported 
to 
be 
a 
major 
source 
of 
calcitonin
immunoreactivity.’S However, most of our patients with
sepsis did not have pulmonary injury. Others have reported
the isolated presence of calcitonin precursors in patients
with benign liver diseases (such as hepatitis) or with
hepatocellular carcinoma, and also the presence of
calcitonin-related RNA in this tumour.8 Perhaps the liver is
the site of procalcitonin production in patients with sepsis.
Since serum calcitonin-like immunoreactivity has been
described in a wide variety of extrathyroid diseases, it is
likely that inflammatory processes other than infection lead
to the elaboration of calcitonin-like immunoreactivity by
various types of cells. Such immunoreactivity and a clinical
picture resembling sepsis have been reported in some
patients with acute pancreatitis.s
The place, if any, of procalcitonin induction in the
cytokine cascade that occurs in sepsis and other
inflammatory processes remains to be investigated. Rapid
and substantial release of procalcitonin, at the same time as
tumour necrosis factor alpha and before interleukin-6, has
been observed in patients with renal cancer after intravenous
administration of interleukin-2 (unpublished). This
observation could help elucidate the mechanism of rapid
procalcitonin production in the septic process. Our results,
based on several specific immunoassays, strongly suggest
that the molecule detected in the serum of patients with
sepsis is procalcitonin. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that some of the aminoacids not involved in the
recognised epitopes may differ. A second calcitonin
messenger, encoding a procalcitonin bearing eight different
aminoacid residues on the carboxy-terminal region, has
been identified in the thyroid. 16 Concentrations of calcitonin
gene-related peptide, the product of the calcitonin gene in
nerve cells, are also increased in patients with sepsis.1?
Further studies are needed to elucidate the importance of
procalcitonin production in association with infection and to
assess a potential role in diagnosis and follow-up of patients
with bacterial sepsis.

Association of fibrinolytic tests with outcome of
acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding
Endogenous fibrinolysis may play a part in acute
upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding by causing
digestion of haemostatic plugs. We assessed the
predictive value of fibrinolytic tests for hospital
outcome in a prospective study of 122 patients with
acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding who
underwent endoscopy.
Serum fibrin degradation products (FDP) were
above the normal range in 32% (95% Cl 21-44%) of
patients who survived and did not require transfusion
or surgery, in 53% (37-69%) of patients who
survived without surgery but required transfusion,
and in 100% (82-100%) of patients who required
surgery or died. Multivariate analysis showed that
after adjustment for the effects of established risk
factors 
(age, 
pulse 
rate, 
blood 
pressure,
haemoglobin, site of bleeding, and stigmata of active
bleeding at endoscopy), serum FDP was a powerful
independent predictor of outcome (p=0&middot;003).
Doubling of serum FDP was associated with a 59%
increase in the risk of a poor outcome (95% Cl
14-120%).
These findings are consistent with roles for
endogenous fibrinolysis in gastrointestinal-tract
bleeding, for fibrinolytic tests in prediction of adverse
outcome, and for fibrinolytic inhibitors in treatment.
Lancet 1993; 341: 518-21
Introduction
About 3000 of the 30 000 people admitted to hospital in
the UK each year for acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract
bleeding will die.1 Prognostic indicators for outcome
include: age, pulse rate, blood pressure, and haemoglobin at
admission, and findings at endoscopy, such as presence, site,
and nature of a bleeding lesion, and stigmata of recent
bleeding.2-4 One factor that may promote continued
bleeding and hence an adverse clinical outcome is the
fibrinolytic activity of the upper gastrointestinal tract,
because fibrinolysis may lead to digestion of haemostatic
plugs.5 Consistent with this possibility, Poller and
colleaguess 
demonstrated 
increased 
serum 
fibrin
degradation products (FDP) in a small series of patients with
acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding; however, the
prognostic value of serum FDP concentrations has not been
reported in a prospective study. We therefore investigated
the prognostic value of both serum FDP concentrations (a
measure of in-vivo fibrinolysis) and the fibrin plate lysis area
(FPLA) of the plasma euglobulin fraction an in-vitro
global test of the fibrinolytic potential of blood.
Patients and methods
We studied 122 patients with acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract
bleeding (haematemesis and/or melaena in the preceding 24 h) who
were admitted between April, 1986, and April, 1988, to the medical
receiving unit of Glasgow Royal Infirmary and who underwent
emergency endoscopy. Because of the known diurnal variation in
FPLA 
patients were assessed and blood sampled between 0900 h
and 1000 h at the time of assessment for endoscopy. Patients who
had emergency endoscopy before this time or who were assessed on
Saturday or Sunday mornings were not included in the study.
Patients were also excluded if they had haemostatic disorders or
were 
receiving 
anticoagulant, 
antifibrinolytic, 
or 
recent
thrombolytic therapy. Clinical prognostic factors recorded included
age, pulse rate, blood pressure, and haemoglobin on admission.
Endoscopic findings were recorded. Patients were followed up until
either discharge or death in hospital, and outcome was recorded in
increasing order of adversity-ie, no blood or red cell transfusion,
acute surgery, or death (group 1); blood or red cell transfusion only
(group 2); or surgery and/or death (group 3).
A venous blood sample was taken from the arm contralateral to
that used for intravenous access or infusions, anticoagulated with
trisodium citrate, and kept on melting ice. Platelet-poor plasma was
obtained by centrifugation at 4&deg;C within 60 min of sampling and
aliquots stored at - 70&deg;C before assay. In addition, serum was
obtained from a clotted blood sample for measurement of FDP as
fibrin-related antigen by tanned red cell haemagglutination-
inhibition immunoassay (Wellcome FDP, Wellcome Diagnostics,

Microangiopathy of Cutaneous Blood and Lymphatic
Capillaries in Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI)*

The severity of microangiopathy in patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) determi-
nates the extent of the trophic disturbances of the skin. Resulting from valvular incompetence
of deep and/or perforating veins and the accompanying venous outflow obstruction caused by
deep venous thrombosis (DVT), the increased ambulatory venous pressure heads are transmit-
ted retrograde into the microvasculature of the skin at the ankle region. In the present study, we
have assessed the changes in the cutaneous microvasculature by dynamic fluorescence video
microscopy, fluorescence microlymphography, and transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2)
measurements.
In mild forms of CVI, capillary density, morphologic characteristics, and tcPO2 are still
normal. Fluorescent light intensity is, however, significantly increased, indicating an increased
transcapillary diffusion of sodium fluorescein (NaF) as a marker for enhanced leakage of the
capillaries in the early stage of the disease. The pericapillary halo diameters are significantly
enlarged, compared to controls (p < 0.01).
In the severe stages of CVI and in patients with venous ulcers, capillary thromboses, probably
caused by endothelium-blood cell interactions, may lead to a reduced capillary density. In order
to enlarge the exchange surface area, the remaining skin capillaries become tortuous (capillary
tufts). Parallel to the reduced capillary number, tcPO2 decreases and can be extremely low at
the ulcer rim or at white atrophy spots. Fibrin cuffs are not a specific finding for venous
ulceration and do not significantly impair oxygen diffusion.
Fluorescence microlymphography permits visualization of the lymphatic capillaries of the
superficial skin. In severe stages of CVI, the lymphatic capillary network at the medial ankle
area is destroyed, and the remaining lymphatic capillary fragments have an increased permeabil-
ity to FITC-dextran with a molecular weight of 150,000. These findings demonstrate a special
lymphatic microangiopathy in CVI, suggesting an additional lymphatic component in the
edema formation.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is mainly caused by chronic obstruction and/or
valvular insufficiency of the deep veins secondary to deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
or by incompetent perforating veins. It is confined almost exclusively to the lower
extremities and leads eventually to trophical skin changes and to venous ulceration at
the medial ankle region. During walking, the pressure heads of ambulatory venous
hypertension are transmitted retrograde via insufficient perforating veins to the skin

microvasculature. This process leads to alterations of the nutritional capillaries and
microlymphatics of the skin and also of the interstitial tissue.
Today new methods permit study of the arising morphologic and functional
changes of the cutaneous microvasculature. In the following study, fluorescence
video microscopy, transcutaneous oxygen tension measurements, and fluorescence
microlymphography were used to assess these changes in patients with chronic
venous insufficiency.
METHODS
Transcutaneous Oxygen Tension Measurements
Transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2) measurements have been described in
detail before [1,2]. This method is basically a polarographic determination of
molecular oxygen diffusing to the skin surface, by means of a modified Clark-type
oxygen electrode. The partial oxygen pressure (PO2) signal results from the reduc-
tion current at the cathode of the electrode, which is proportional to the amount of
oxygen diffusing from the capillaries to the skin surface. This technique gives a
quantitative measure for skin oxygenation.
A special probe, used in this study, permits the simultaneous observation of the
capillaries at the oxygen sensing site by video microscopy [3]. The electrode consists
of a single platinum cathode (tip diameter, 15 Rxm) melted in a glass cylinder and a
silver-silver/chloride anode ring surrounding the transparent center portion.
A core temperature of 45°C, which results in an effective skin surface temperature
of 43°C, was used to obtain maximal local flow conditions. Figure 1 shows the
investigational set-up.
Fluorescence Video Microscopy
Dynamic fluorescence video microscopy [4] includes capillaroscopy of the skin by a
video microscopy system before and after intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye
sodium fluorescein (NaF). This fluorochrome is used to study transcapillary diffusion
and to visualize structures, for example, the pericapillary space which cannot be
depicted otherwise. Video microscopy is the only method that promotes direct
information about the cutaneous microcirculation.
The apparatus consits of an incident light fluorescence microscope (Leica AG,
Herbrugg, Switzerland) with a mercury vapor lamp (HBO 100W, Osram, Germany),
a cadmium-selenide camera (c-vidicon, K30, Siemens, Karlsruhe, Germany), a video
timer (For-A-Company, Chiba, Japan), a video scale marker (For-A-Company), a
video monitor (Philipps, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), and a video tape recorder
(S-VHS, Panasonic, Japan). The microscope and the camera are mounted on a
special support (Leica AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland), which permits optimal adjust-
ment of the microscope to the skin [5].
Fluorescence Microlymphography
Unlike the blood capillaries of the skin, the cutaneous microlymphatics cannot be
visualized without contrast media. Therefore a subepidermal injection of 0.01 ml
FITC (fluorescein-isothiocyanate)-dextran with a molecular weight of 150,000 in a 20
percent solution is administered at the medial ankle region by means of a steel
microcannula with an outer diameter of 0.2 mm. From an initial deposit of the

PATIENTS
Combined Transcutaneous P02-Capillary Morphology Study
Healthy Subjects:
The group of 24 healthy subjects consisted of seven women
and 17 men with a mean age of 48 years (range, 19-75 years). They had no clinical
evidence of peripheral atherosclerotic or venous disease. In this group, 35 measure-
ments of tcPO2 were obtained (11 bilateral measurements).
Patients:
The CVI group included 17 patients with a mean age of 56 years
(range, 22-76 years). Forty-four measurements were obtained in this group. In 12
patients, CVI was caused by deep venous thrombosis, and five patients suffered from
primary varicose veins with incompetent perforating veins. Nine patients had trophic
skin changes with ulcers or healed ulcers. The diagnosis was based on the patient's
history, the clinical findings, and the results of Doppler ultrasound examination.
Venograms were obtained in seven patients.
Fluorescence Video Microscopy-NaF Studies
Healthy Subjects:
Fifteen healthy probands without evidence of CVI served as
controls (mean age, 61 years; range, 35-73 years). Only volunteers with normal
venous Doppler examinations were included.
39
FRANZECK ET AL.
Patients with Mild CVI:
In this study group, 15 patients with lower limb edema,
corona phlebectatica paraplantaris, and slight trophic skin changes were included.
The mean age was 54 years (range, 28-75 years). Four patients had primary varicose
veins (incompetence of perforating veins), and 11 patients exhibited post-thrombotic
changes.
Patients with Severe CVI:
The study group consisted of 15 patients with severe
chronic venous insufficiency, with pronounced trophic skin changes, hyperpigmenta-
tion, and induration of the gaiter area. Ten patients had healed venous ulcers (mean
age, 57 years; range, 47-73 years). Venous Doppler studies were performed in all
patients. In seven patients, the findings were typical for obstruction and/or valvular
insufficiency of deep veins (post-thrombotic syndrome), whereas, in eight patients,
primary varicose veins with incompetent perforating veins were present.
Fluorescence Microlymphography Study
Healthy Subjects:
In the control group, 15 healthy volunteers were included.
Their mean age was 31 years (range, 23-45 years). A total of 17 microlymphographies
were performed (twice bilateral).
Patients:
Twenty-one patients (14 women, seven men) with a mean age of 51
years (range, 19-80 years) were in the CVI group. Thirty-two studies were performed
(11 times bilateral examinations).
In 20 legs, CVI had developed as a consequence of deep venous thrombosis. In the
remaining 12 legs, primary varicose veins with insufficient perforators were diag-
nosed.
RESULTS
Combined Transcutaneous P02-Capillary Morphology Study
Control Group:
In 24 healthy subjects, mean tcPO2 of the medial ankle region
was 56.8 + 9.9 mm Hg (range, 38-79 mm Hg).
The superficial skin capillaries were homogeneously distributed. The capillary
density averaged 45 capillaries per mm2. Depending on the skin transparency, usually
only the apex of the capillary loops could be observed, because the skin capillary
loops at the ankle area run perpendicular to the skin surface.
Patients with CVI:
In CVI patients, the mean tcPO2 was 47.7 + 14.5 mm Hg
(range, 21-83 mm Hg) when the measurements were performed at the medial ankle
area above incompetent perforating veins and without major trophic skin changes
(p > 0.05).
The simultaneous video microscopic examination at the oxygen sensing site
revealed dilated and tortuous capillaries, which frequently appeared to be sur-
rounded by a distinct halo structure. The number of capillaries was not significantly
reduced (p > 0.05) at these sites (see Fig. 2).
Over skin areas with moderate to severe trophic changes, tCP02 averaged 22.5 + 7.0
mm Hg (range, 13-26 mm Hg). This value is significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that
in the control group and in the CVI group without trophic changes of the skin.
The capillary density was less than ten capillaries per mm2 in these areas. The
tortuosity and dilatation of the capillaries increased in proportion to the reduction in
capillary number. The remaining capillaries that were observed were extremely
dilated, with irregularly shaped arteriolar and venular limbs (capillary tufts). Capil-

laries were counted after the study on single frames at the video monitor during
playback of the video tape.
In the center of white atrophy spots, no capillaries were visible (avascular fields),
whereas, in the border zones, they were enlarged and meandering. The capillaries
sometimes had a glomerulus-like appearance, and mean tcPO2 reached 24.0 mm Hg
(range, 12-44 mm Hg) in these border zones. An example is shown in Fig. 3.
The large range of single P02 determinations is the result of the varying distances
between oxygen sensor and adjacent capillaries in the border zone of white atrophy
and in areas of decreased capillary density. This distance is of great importance for
tcPO2 measurements, since greater distance results in lower P02 values, and vice

The measurements were performed using large-window video densitometry. Fluorescent light

versa. The same situation applies to the center areas of white atrophy where no
capillaries were observed. The tcPO2 values were measured at 0 mm Hg or close to 0
mm Hg at these sites (see Fig. 3). The distance between the cathode tip of the oxygen
sensor and the capillary was more than 100 p.m when the tcPO2 was extremely
reduced.
Fluorescence Video Microscopy-NaF Studies
Healthy Subjects and Patients with Mild CVI:
The appearance of the fluorescent
dye in the capillaries of skin areas without trophic lesions was homogeneous in both
groups. The transcapillary diffusion of NaF was significantly enhanced in patients, as
indicated by the mean fluorescent light intensities, which are significantly increased
(p < 0.01) until 15 minutes after dye appearance (Table 1). The maximum fluores-
cent light intensity (FLI) is reached earlier than in healthy controls (p < 0.05).
The mean diameter of the pericapillary space (halo) was significantly enlarged
(p < 0.001), which is the expression of an initial pericapillary microedema. Whereas
in healthy probands the mean diameter was 81 ± 15 pm, in patients with mild CVI
the diameter amounts to 138 ± 13 pLm. The distribution of single values in the control
group is normal (Gaussian distribution). This distribution was not the case, however,
in patients with CVI [7], which indicates that the enhanced capillary leakage is not a
regular phenomenon but is inhomogeneously distributed.
Severe CVI:
In contrast to healthy subjects, in whom all capillaries of the
observation field were perfused within 32 seconds after the initial appearance of the
dye (filling time), the appearance of NaF in the skin capillaries of patients with
severe CVI was mainly asynchronous. The filling time was prolonged, and it could

last 64 seconds, until all capillaries of the observation field were perfused. These
findings speak in favor of an increased heterogeneity of the microvascular perfusion
in these severe stages.
In some patients, there can be found capillary convolutes filled with red blood cells
and flow-stop, which are not perfused with the fluorescent dye even after 30 minutes.
This finding is interpreted as capillary thrombosis (microthrombosis).
Whereas the transcapillary diffusion was no longer increased (p > 0.05) in severe
CVI, compared to the control group [7] as an indicator of end-stage disease, the
enlargement of the halo diameters was significant (p < 0.001).
Fluorescence Microlymphography Study
Mild CVI.
In cases with CVI without trophic changes, no changes of lymphatic
capillary morphology were observed. The propagation of the fluorescent dye was,
however, significantly enhanced (refer to Table 2). The enlarged extension of the
microlymphatic network is probably due to the increased lymphatic drainage caused
by the enhanced leakage of the blood capillaries.
Moderate and Severe CVI:
In patients with trophic changes in the medial ankle
region, the superficial network of the lymphatic capillaries was damaged. The
meshes which form a regular network in healthy controls and in patients without
trophic skin changes were interrupted, only partially filled, or completely obliterated
(Fig. 4). Fragments of lymphatic capillaries may be filled relatively far away from the
deposit. In cases with no filling of capillaries at all, the dye moved diffusely into the
interstitial space.
DISCUSSION
The present studies demonstrate a pronounced microangiopathy of blood and
lymphatic capillaries in patients with severe chronic venous insuffiency as a conse-
quence of the increased venous pressure during walking; this condition results
mainly from valvular incompetence of the deep and perforating veins. In addition,
venous outflow obstruction caused by deep venous thrombosis may contribute to the
peripheral venous hypertension.
In the initial stages ofCVI, the microangiopathy is characterized by dilatation of the
blood capillaries. As a result of the proposed retrograde transmitted pressure heads,

the capillaries eventually become dilated, tortuous, and form capillary convolutes or
tufts [8,9]. So far, however, capillary pressure measurements in patients with chronic
venous incompetence have not been performed because of technical difficulties;
therefore it must be stated that the proposed mechanism is hypothetical and not yet
proven.
The transcapillary diffusion of the low molecular fluorochrome sodium fluorescein
is increased as a result of enhanced capillary leakage. The pericapillary space is
enlarged, due to the developing microedema, and its diameters are no longer
normally distributed but show a wider range than that in healthy subjects.
The morphology of lymphatic capillaries is still normal in the initial disease. The
extension of the FITC-stained network is already significantly increased, however,
compared with control subjects [10]. This condition is caused mainly by the increased
capillary leakage, which consequently leads to an increase in lymph fluid.
Transcutaneous oxygen tension is normal in this early stage of the disease, where
capillary density at the sensing site is normal [9], which demonstrates a sufficient
oxygen supply to the skin in the mild form of chronic venous incompetence. The
normal range of transcutaneous oxygen tension is between 50 and 80 mm Hg.
In more severe stages of CVI, microthrombosis of capillaries can be found [11]
contributing to the locally reduced capillary density at potential ulcer sites of the
medial ankle region. Most likely these microthromboses are the consequence of
interactions between leucocytes and other blood cells with the vessel wall of
post-capillary venules. The capillaries are stuffed with red blood cell aggregates,
which would not be the case if thrombosis were to start in the terminal arterioles or at
the arterial side of the capillary loop. In such cases, the capillaries are void of
corpuscular blood elements.
Transcutaneous oxygen tension decreases parallel to the reduction in capillary

number. The role of pericapillary fibrin cuffs as an oxygen diffusion barrier, indicated
by the decreased P02 values, is unlikely. It was shown by Michel [12] that pericapil-
lary cuffs do not impair oxygen diffusion. Vanscheidt et al. [13] found no clear
relationship between the presence of fibrin cuff and tcP02; however, capillary density
is the number one factor for reduced tcP02 values in CVI [9].
At the border zones of white atrophy spots, which are potential sites for venous
ulcer formation, the capillary density is significantly reduced, and the capillaries are
even more tortuous than in the mild stages of the disease. In these cases, the increase
in capillary size is most likely necessary to increase the exchange area between intra-
and extravascular compartments for fluids and soluble substances. Similar changes in
capillary morphology are observed at cutaneous scar sites after injuries. The measure-
ment of transcutaneous P02 depends on the distance between oxygen sensor and
adjacent capillaries at such sites with reduced capillary number and irregular
distribution of capillaries. The reduced P02 implies localized, spot-like ischemia of
these areas, and additional minor external and internal factors may lead to the tissue
damage and ulcer formation.
In the center of white atrophy, avascular fields are present, which result in
enlarged diffusion distances and in significantly prolonged diffusion times [14]. In
this stage of the disease, lymphatic microangiopathy progresses, and the lymphatic
capillary network becomes destroyed and obliterated [10]. The diffusion of FITC-
dextran 150,000 is enhanced. In severe cases, only fragments of lymphatic capillary
can be found. These changes demonstrate an additional lymphatic component of
edema formation in CVI.
Finally, venous ulceration is obviously caused by localized microvascular ischemia,
which does not result only from one, but from multiple factors [15]. Further research
is necessary in order to gain more direct evidence of the importance of white cells in
the cascade of events leading to ulcer formation. We will also try to measure capillary
pressures at the ankle area in those patients with impeding venous ulceration in
order to prove the proposed mechanism of retrograde transmitted pressure eleva-
tion.

8349732,"Beta and Gamma Actin mRNAs Are Differentially 
Located within Myoblasts 
Mark A. Hill and Peter Gunning 
Cell Biology Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Wentworthville, New South Wales 2145, Australia 
Abstract. Actin is of fundamental importance to all 
eukaryotic cells. Of the six mammalian actins, beta 
(/3) and gamma (3"") cytoplasmic are the isoforms found 
in all nonmuscle cells and differ by only four amino 
acids at the amino-terminal region. Both genes are 
regulated temporally and spatially, though no differ- 
ences in protein function have been described. Using 
fluorescent double in situ hybridization we describe 
the simultaneous intracellular localization of both/3 
and 3' actin mRNA. This study shows that myoblasts 
differentially segregate the/3 and 3' actin mRNAs. The 
distribution of 3' actin mRNA, only to perinuclear and 
nearby cytoplasm, suggests a distribution based on 
diffusion or restriction to nearby cytoplasm. The dis- 
tribution of fl actin mRNA, perinuclear and at the cell 
periphery, implicates a peripheral localizing signal 
which is unique to the fl isoform. The peripheral fl 
actin mRNA corresponded to cellular morphologies, 
extending processes, and ruffling edges that reflect cell 
movement. Total actin and 3' actin protein steady-state 
distributions were identified by specific antibodies. 3' 
actin protein was found in both stress fibers and at the 
cell plasma membrane and does not correspond to its 
mRNA distribution. We suggest that localized protein 
synthesis rather than steady-state distribution function- 
ally differentiates between the actin isoforms. 
emerging mechanism for controlling protein expres- 
sion is intracellular localization of the translation 
event, mRNA localization occurs in early embryonic 
development (Yisraeli et al., 1990), in neurons (for review 
see Steward and Banker, 1992), and in wound repair (Hoock 
et al., 1991). Actin mRNAs were among the first shown to 
be localized within cells (Lawrence and Singer, 1985, 1986) 
and probes which identify all isoforms show actin mRNA at 
the motile periphery of chick fibroblasts and myoblasts 
(Lawrence and Singer, 1985, 1986; Sundell and Singer, 
1990), and in association with the cytoskeleton (Sundell and 
Singer, 1991). Indeed, mRNA association with the cyto- 
skeleton for transportation and positioning is probably the 
mechanism used both in development (Yisraeli et al., 1990) 
and in mature cells (Hesketh and Pryme, 1991; Taneja et al., 
1992). Mammalian endothelial cells localize/3 actin mRNA 
to peripheral regions of motility (Hoock et al., 1991). Trans- 
port of mRNA is probably a process involving either the 3' 
untranslated region (3'UTR) t sequence (Gottlieb, 1992) 
or its secondary structure (Macdonald and Struhl, 1988; 
Mowry and Melton, 1992) binding to a carrier. Interestingly, 
the/3 and ~ actin isoforms share no sequence homology in

their 3'UTR when analyzed by sequence comparison rou- 
tines (Erba et al., 1986). If the 3'UTRs of these two mRNAs 
have a specific function, then it is possibly different for each 
of these actin isoforms. One function for the 3'UTR of/3 actin 
mRNA is its localization within cells (Singer, R. H., per- 
sonal communication). One question this raises is whether 
the actin mRNAs are identically located within cells. 
The microfilaments of the cell cytoskeleton are made from 
the two nonmuscle cytoplasmic /3 and ""t actin isoforms. 
While both actin isoforms are very similar, differing by only 
four amino acids near the amino terminus (Vanderkerckhove 
and Weber, 1978), they have different roles in overall cell 
cytoarchitecture. The/3:3/ratio within cells is strictly regu- 
lated (Otey et al., 1987), and perturbation of this ratio in 
myoblasts by transfection with either fl or -y actin has 
significant and opposite effects (Schevzov et al., 1992; Lloyd 
et al., 1992). Increasing /3 actin results in larger cells 
whereas increasing 7 actin decreases cell size (Schevzov et 
al., 1992). This suggests that myoblasts differentiate between 
isoforms and use the proteins differently. Similarly, there 
have been shown to be differences between the ability of actin 
protein isoforms to incorporate into myotubes in vitro (Peng 
and Fischman, 1991). In contrast, both muscle and non- 
muscle isoforms have been shown to incorporate into the 
cytoskeleton (Gunning et al., 1984; McKenna et al., 1985). 
It is therefore not yet clear at what level and how the differ- 
ences between actin isoforms occur and what these differ- 
ences may mean to actin isoform function within the cell.

within the cell. We report in this study that ""y and ~/actin 
mRNAs are not identically located in myoblasts. 
Materials and Methods 
Cell Culture and Protein Analysis 
The intracellular distribution of 3, and/~ actin mRNA and protein was ana- 
lyzed in C2 myoblasts (Yaffe and Saxel, 1977) and C2 clones transfected 
with the human/~ actin gene (Schevzov et al., 1992). Cells were grown on 
collagen-coated (calf-skin collagen, Calbiochem, Sydney, Australia) glass 
multiwell slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL), in MEM plus 20% FCS 
(Cytosysterns, Sydney, Australia), and 0.5% chick embryo extract (Flow, 
Sydney, Australia). The next day cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, and 
then in cold methanol for 20 rain. 
For protein studies cells were fixed and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 
primary antibody, washed three times with PBS, and identified with a 
fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody (Tago Inc., Burlingame, CA). 
Confocal microscope analysis on double-labeled cells was carried out as de- 
scribed for in situ analysis. The C4 monoclonal total actin antibody was 
provided by Dr. J. Lessard (Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cin- 
cinnati, OH). The 3' actin rabbit antisera was provided by Dr. J. C. Bulinski 
(Columbia University, New York). 
RNA Probes 
Isoform specific 3' UTR probes were derived from the mouse genes, with 
complementary strands used as the controls. The ~ actin probe was a 198 
bp fragment from 1,468-1,665 (accession no. x03672). The ""y actin probe 
was a 264 bp fragment from 1,310-1,574 (accession no. x13055). These 
fragments were cloned into pGEM-3Z (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and 
orientation determined by Northern and slot blot analysis (data not shown). 
All chemicals were of RNA grade, solutions diethylpyrocarbonate treated 
and/or autoclaved with sterile plnsticware used throughout. Plasmids were 
linearized appropriately for either SP6 or T7 polymerase directed RNA syn- 
thesis. Synthesized RNA was labeled by incorporating either digoxigenin- 
conjugated UTP or fluorescein-conjugated UTP as recommended by the 
manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim, Sydney, Australia). Briefly, to 1/,tg 
of linearized template was added 2 #1 of a 10 retool/1 nucleotide mix (includ- 
ing 6.5 mmol/l labeled UTP and 3.5 mmol/l unlabeled UTP), 2 #1 of 10× 
transcription buffer, 2 #1 of either polymernse, 12 /tl H20, and 1 #1 of 
RNnse inhibitor. After 2 h at 37°C, the template was destroyed by DNase 
treatment, RNA precipitated and resuspended in 98 #1 of H20, and 2 ttl of 
RNase inhibitor. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA was then quantified by compari- 
son with known standards on slot blot analysis with alkaline phosphatase 
(AP)-conjngated antibodies and staining as described for slide staining be- 
low. Typically 1/10 of the labeled product was used for each hybridization 
series. 
In Situ Hybridization 
Hybridization procedures were based on those described in Lawrence and 
Singer (1985, 1986). All chemicals were of RNA grade. All solutions 
diethylpyrocarbonate treated and/or autoclaved. Glassware and instruments 
were baked overnight at 200°C. Hybridization solution was made fresh each 
time and contained: 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% N-lanrosarcusine, 
0.1% SDS, 100 #g/ml tRNA, 5 % blocking solution (Boehringer Mannheim, 
Sydney, Australia), 20% dextran sulfate. Slide prehybridizatiou was in 500 
~1 of hybridization solution without probe at 45°C for 1 h with a coverslip. 
The prehybridization solution was removed and probe or control RNA was 
added in 100/zl of hybridization solution, coversfipped, and then incubated 
at 45ec overnight in a humidified container. In double-labeling experiments 
both probes were added together. Slides were washed with 2 × SSC at 450C, 
and then 1 × SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C. High stringency wash conditions were 
three washes in 0.1× SSC at 65°C each for 30 rain with agitation. Lower 
temperature washes at 40°C in 0.5× SSC with addition of 50% formamide 
and posttreatment with RNase gave similar results. Slides were then 
equilibrated in PBS. Experiments using fluorescein-conjngated RNA alone 
were then mounted and analyzed. Experiments using digoxigenin-labeled 
RNA alone or double-labeled with fluorescein-conjugated RNA were fur- 
ther processed. Rhodamine- and fluorescein-conjngated antibodies (Boeh- 
ringer Mannheim, Sydney, Australia) were diluted 1:10 in PBS with 0.5% 
BSA, reacted with blocked slides (10% inactivated FCS in PBS 1 h at 370C) 
for 1-2 h at 37""C, and then washed in PBS at pH 7.5, or at pH 8 to reduce 
nonspecific binding. Slides were mounted in 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane 
(Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO) in glycerol. 
For AP-conjngated antibodies, the slides were blocked for 30 rain, 
washed three times in TBS, pH 7.5, for 10 rain, incubated with anti- 
digoxigenin-AP (Boehringer Mannheim, Sydney, Australia) diluted 1:100 
with ""rBS, reacted in staining solution for 1 h, color development stopped 
with water, and then were dehydrated, mounted, photographed, and ana- 
lyzed (Leitz Fluorovert FS). Staining solution (Boehringer Mannbeim, Syd- 
ney, Australia) consisted of: 10 ml Tris buffer, pH 9.5; 50 #1 nitroblue 
tetrazulium chloride solution (100 mg in 1.3 ml dimethylformamide, 70% 
vol/vol); 37.5 ~tl 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate solution (50 mg in 
1 ml dimethylformamide). 
Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope Analysis 
A ConFocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) (W'dd Leitz Instruments, 
Heidelberg, Germany) with a 40× objective (1.3 NA) allowing a minimum 
slice thickness of 0.75 ~tm was used to analyze label distribution within 
cells. Cells with a fully spread morphology, previously determined by lime- 
lapse video analysis (data not shown), were analyzed for ~ and -y actin 
mRNA distribution. Cells were optically sectioned in the xy and xz planes 
(parallel and perpendicular to substratum) with multiple scan averaging and 
all images stored on optical disc. Extended focus is an algorithm which 
compiles individual sections of the whole cell (Wilson and Carlini, 1988). 
In double-labeling experiments, identical confocal sfices were taken for 
both probes allowing direct comparison of both mRNAs within each cell. 
Labeling intensity was analyzed directly on the CLSM with supplied 
software or on images ffansferred to Macintosh computers (Apple, Austra- 
lia) and examined with NIH Image 1.41. 
YUTR Sequence Comparison 
Primary sequence comparisons for both mouse/~ and 7 actin full length 
3~-TR sequences were compared using Macvector (Version 3.5, IBI, New 
Haven, CT) routines. Secondary structures of the 3~I'R sequences were 
determined by the minimal energy folding method of Zuker (1989). 
Results 
Folding of ~ and.v Actin mRNA 3'UTRs 
Many studies to date point to the 3'UTR as the region of lo- 
calization signals either as part of the primary sequence 
(Gottlieb, 1992) or the secondary structures they form (Mac- 
donald and Struhl, 1988; Mowry and Melton, 1992). We 
compared 1~ and ~ actin 3~tYl'R primary sequences and found 
no similarities between them. In contrast, the YUTR of each 
has been highly conserved between species (Erba et al., 
1988; Tokunaga et al., 1988), suggesting an evolutionary se- 
lection to maintain some specific function. Minimal energy 
folding of both YUTRs by the method of Zuker (1989) 
showed quite different overall secondary structures (Fig. 1). 
The complex patterns of stem loop structures does not ex- 
clude the possibility that a specific smaller subsequence 
could be involved with a common mRNA localizing mecha- 
nism. However, the lack of similarity between the two 
YUTRs suggested to us the possibility of different handling 
of the actin isoform mRNAs by the cell.

substantially larger, allowing more accurate mRNA localiza-

staining in ruffling edges and filipodia which are features of 
motile cells. The regions of peripheral localization of/3 actin 
mRNA differed from cell to cell. Narrow processes typically 
had very positive labeling at the growing tips (white arrows, 
Fig. 2 b). The same cells could also have strong peripheral 
labeling in broad peripheral cytoplasmic regions (black ar- 
rows, Fig. 2 b). This type of different regionalized peripheral 
labeling varied from cell to cell and within individual cells. 
More accurate localization was determined by CLSM with 
fluorscent labeling (Fig. 3). In spread cells, 3' actin mRNA 
was found mainly in two intracellular regions, nuclear and 
cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus (perinuclear) (Fig. 3B). 
Nuclear labeling was itself in two forms, diffuse and local- 
ized ""hotspot"" labeling. The hotspots may represent true 
localized accumulation of mRNA (Carter et al., 1991) but 
were also occasionally seen in some controls (Fig. 3 F). 
Perinuclear labeling appeared strongest in cytoplasm directly 
surrounding the nucleus and decreased in intensity with dis- 
tance from the nucleus. Individual xy cell slices (equal cell 
volumes) and direct probe detection gave the same result, 
showing that the concentration of 3"" actin mRNA decreases 
away from the perinuclear region. In rounded cells, 3' actin 
mRNA labeling was always higher than in spread cells (Fig. 
3, B, H, and I) and found surrounding the nucleus. CLSM 
scans of cells which have recently divided and are in the pro- 
cess of separation (Fig. 3, G, H, and I), show high 3"" actin 
mRNA labeling in the cytoplasmic regions between the two 
cells and on the opposite side of the nucleus in cytoplasm 
directly opposite the cleavage plane. 
In spread cells,/~ aetin mRNA was found mainly in three 
intracellular regions (Fig. 3 D): nuclear, perinuclear, and at 
the periphery of the cell. The nuclear and perinuelear label- 
ing was similar to that found for 3' aetin mRNA. The labeling 
at the periphery was similar tothat seen in the AP study, in 
ruffling edges, and in processes (Fig. 3 D). Processes were 
generally always labeled (white arrows, Fig. 3 D) while 
regions of labeling near membrane edges in the main cell 
cytoplasm were always found but were variable in both 
amount and location. 
Double Labeling of[3 and,y Actin mRNA 
Single-labeling experiments show that the distribution of 
and 3' actin mRNA is different within populations of cells, 
but cannot be directly compared in an individual cell. To 
localize both rnRNA species within individual cells, double 
in situ hybridization labeling was required (Figs. 4 and 5). 
This obviates the variations resulting from any dynamic 
differences in morphology between cells. Double labeling 
for individual cells confirmed the general distributions of 
and 3' actin mRNA found in our cell population study: 
colocalization in the nuclear and perinuclear regions, with 
only ~ at the periphery of the cells (Fig. 4, i and j). 
Serial CLSM optical slices parallel to the substrate (Fig. 
4, a-j) show that most of both mRNAs are in the lowest plane 
of the cell (Fig. 4, i and j). The cells have morphologies that 
suggest that they have recently divided and are in the early 
stages of actively spreading on the collagen substrate; the left 
hand cell is still fairly rounded and the right hand cell is ex- 
tending its cytoplasm (Fig. 4 i, white arrow). The rounded 
cell shows both/~ and 3, act.in mRNA labeling in the small 
amount of cytoplasm present (Fig. 4, e-j). The lowest plane 
optical slice in the extending cell (Fig. 4 i) also shows that 
actin mRNA is concentrated in a peripheral motile region 
(Fig. 4 i, white arrow), while the same region (Fig. 4j) is 
negative for 3"" actin mRNA. A scan of ~ and 3' actin fluores- 
cence intensity in the lowest plane optical slice (Fig. 4 1), 
along a line from nucleus to periphery (shown in Fig. 4 k), 
clearly shows the difference between the two mRNAs at the 
peripheral region. For both plots the fluorescence intensity 
scale has been equalized, removing quantitative differences, 
and shows that increasing 3, fluorescence does not give any 
peripheral signal.

ried out for individual single-labeled cells along a line from 
the center of the nucleus to the cell periphery (Fig. 5 A).

(Schevzov et al., 1992) within the cells. 
The same arbitrary divisions (nuclear, perinuclear, cyto- 
plasmic, peripheral) of the cell were used for analysis of 
whole cell populations. In the AP study, peripheral localiza- 
tion occurred in 80 and 85% of cells (in random samples C2 
and/3 actin transfected clones, respectively, n > 80). Quanti- 
tation of all the cells in the fluorescence studies produced 
very similar results (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, high density cul- 
tures show less overall peripheral distribution of label (data 
not shown). Cells in high density cultures are in close con- 
tact and less motile, supporting the concept of an association 
of peripheral/3 actin mRNA with cell motility (Hoock et al., 
1991). 
Total and 7 Actin Protein Localization 
The asymmetric distribution of actin isoform mRNA would 
perhaps predict a restricted 3' actin protein distribution. The 
distribution of total actin and 3"" actin protein was found to 
be essentially the same, in both cytoplasmic bundles and at 
the cell periphery (Fig. 6). No differences in structures la- 
beled were seen, although some intensity differences oc- 
cuffed. This suggests that the B and 3' proteins are not 
differentially localized overall in structures within myoblasts 
(Otey et al., 1986) though differences have been described 
for muscle and non-muscle isoforms in myotubes (Pardo et 
al., 1983; Peng and Fischman, 1991) and pericytes (DeNofrio 
et al., 1989). In addition, localization differences for two ac- 
tin isoforms which apparently incorporate into similar struc- 
tures may be more subtle or transient than can be detected 
by this form of analysis. This result does however show that 
3"" actin is not restricted by the distribution of its mRNA. 
Discussion 
Intracellular Sorting of mRNAs from a 
Multigene Family 
Localization of mRNA potentially allows intracellular sort- 
ing of protein isoforms from a multigene family that are very 
similar in primary sequence. Such a mechanism has not been 
previously described. We have shown that/~ and 3"" actin iso- 
forms, which differ by only four amino acids (Vandekerck- 
hove and Weber, 1978), have different intracellular distribu-

tions of their mRNAs. We find both/~ and 7 actin mRNA 
in the perinuclear region, and/~ actin mR.NA alone at the cell 
periphery. This suggests that cells can discriminate between 
isoforms at the mRNA level and that this may have a role in 
the function of each specific isoform. 
Early studies suggested that all actin mRNA was localized 
at sites of cell motility (Lawrence and Singer, 1985, 1986; 
Sundell and Singer, 1990). Subsequently,/3 actin mRNA has 
been shown to be localized at motile regions in wound repair 
(Hoock et al., 1991). Our results show that myoblasts also 
localize/3 actin mRNA in morphological regions of motility 
and, as with endothelial cells (Hoock et al., 1991), in other 
non-peripheral regions. We now show that 7 actin mRNA 
has no such association with the cell periphery, though it is 
localized to the perinuclear region and appears redistributed 
in cells after cell division (see Fig. 2). Unfortunately, no 
other studies have looked at 7 actin mRNA intracellular dis- 
tribution. It is therefore not yet clear whether differential 
sorting of actin isoform mRNAs is a general feature of non- 
muscle cells.

in C2 myoblasts. CLSM extended focus visualization show similar 
staining patterns near the nucleus, in stress fibers and at the periph- 
ery of the cell. 3' actin protein does not appear to be restricted by 
its mRNA distribution. Inset shows very high actin labeling in a 
pair of recently divided cells. No differences in overall structures 
labeled were seen, although some intensity differences occurred. 
The Function of mRNA Localization 
Historically, localizing mRNA within the cell appears func- 
tionally important when the synthesis of the protein is re- 
gionally important. In the egg, polarity determining maternal 
mRNAs are specifically targeted to different regions by their 
3~YFR (Macdonald and Struhl, 1988; Mowry and Melton, 
1992; Gavis and Lehmann, 1992). In other cells, specifying 
the location of translation may also regulate the positive 
(Merlie and Sanes, 1985; Simon et al., 1992) or negative

(Colman et al., 1982) effects of appropriate protein expres- 
sion. In neurons, several mRNAs, including those for the 
cytoskeletal protein MAP2 (Garner et al., 1988) and the 
postsynapticaUy concentrated calcium/calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase II (Burgin et al., 1990), are specifically trans- 
ported into dendrites. Thus morphologically and cytoskele- 
tally specialized neuronal cells, as well as simpler epithelial 
cells, use mRNA localization to control protein function. 
Actin mRNA localization does not easily fit such a model. 
Actin is found throughout the cell in microfilaments and 
directly under the plasma membrane. The peripheral local- 
ization of actin mRNA (Lawrence and Singer, 1985, 1986; 
Sundell and Singer, 1990, Hoock et al., 1991) does not re- 
strict the distribution of the actin protein isoforms. Similarly, 
endothelial cells which do appear to concentrate/3 actin at 
motile regions also have/3 actin throughout the entire cell 
(Hooek et al., 1991). We show that in myoblasts 3"" actin is 
also found wherever any actin is found. While we cannot ex- 
clude that temporal or subtle differences in protein distribu- 
tion or concentration may occur, it is apparent that 3"" actin 
mRNA distribution does not act to determine the steady- 
state location of the protein. Furthermore, it would now be 
informative to look at the distribution of both/3 and 3"" actin 
isoforms in the same cell. 
We suggest an alternative model for the function of the lo- 
calization of actin isoform mRNA; that of a single gene used 
to regulate availability of new actin monomer at the cell 
periphery. To form new actin filaments for cytoskeletal 
remodeling, free actin monomer is required at concentra- 
tions that allow polymerization to occur. Free actin mono- 
mer levels are probably very low, with most cellular actin as- 
sociated with binding proteins (for review see Pollard and 
Cooper, 1986) and incorporated into microfilament poly- 
mer. The availability of newly synthesized free/3 actin mono- 
mer at the periphery would provide a ready pool to allow 
rapid changes to the cytoskeleton. Perinuclear mRNA may 
then act as a reservoir which could be drawn upon to supply 
specific motile regions, transported peripherally by micro- 
filaments (Stmdell and Singer, 1991). Alternatively the peri- 
nuclear pool of actin mRNAs may provide a functionally dis- 
tinct source of actin monomer within the cell. 
Localization may allow specific regional changes in the 
cell cytoskeleton to occur in association with cell motility. 
A model of rapid cellular movement is that which occurs 
during wound healing. Epithelial cells in vivo localize actin 
intracellularly at a wound edge as part of the process to close 
the wound (Martin and Lewis, 1992). Endothelial cells in 
vitro localize/3 mRNA, and indeed may enrich for/3 actin 
protein, at wound edges where rapid movement is occurring 
(Hoock et al., 1991). Another system which points to/3 actin 
as the dynamically responsive isoform is in neural regenera- 
tion after lesion. During neural regeneration, when proces- 
ses are extending, /3 actin mRNA increases (Phillips and 
Steward, 1990) while 3' actin is downregulated (Poirier et 
al., 1992). 
Function of Actin Isoforras 
The differential localization of/3 and 3' actin mRNAs may 
contribute to the functional differences between these two 
genes. We have previously observed that transfection of the 
/3 actin gene can produce larger cells whereas transfection of 
the 3' actin gene results in reduced cell size (Schevzov et al., 
1992). In the case of the/3 actin transfection, the total B actin 
mRNA pool more than doubles. In contrast, the 3' actin 
transfection reduces the 13 actin mRNA pool (Lloyd et al., 
1992). 
It is not unreasonable to expect that these changes in the 
/3 actin mRNA level will produce parallel changes in the pe- 
ripheral pool of/3 actin mRNA. If this peripheral pool is 
used to control membrane remodeling, then changes in this 
pool may control the ability of the cell to spread. This 
presents a provocative hypothesis. The difference between 
the impact of the/3 and 3, actin transfections may not simply 
be a function of different properties of the proteins them- 
selves. Indeed, it is possible that whereas/3 actin rather than 
3' actin mRNA is used to supply new monomer at the leading 
edge, the two proteins may be functionally equivalent at this 
intracellular site. Alternatively,/3 actin may be the function- 
ally preferred protein to be used at this site. To test these two 
alternatives, it will be necessary to carry out a transfection 
with the/3 actin mRNA localizing signal inserted into the 3"" 
actin gene. 
Three other results support this concept of actin isoform 
function. First, the effects of 3' actin gene transfection on cell 
size correlates with effects seen in neural regeneration 
models. After neural damage, the regrowth of neuron pro- 
cesses is inhibited by increasing 3' actin mRNA (Poirier et 
al., 1992). Second, during the cell cycle 3' actin isoform ex- 
pression changes (McCairns et al., 1984; Maisbay et al., 
1988). Increasing 3' actin may be involved with cell rounding 
before cell division and potentially with cell cleavage after 
division. Our current experiments do not address the rela- 
tionship between the cell cycle morphological changes and 
actin mRNA expression, though 3' actin mRNA is increased 
and highly localized after karyokinesis. Third, we have 
shown that whereas myoblasts transfected with the entire 3' 
actin gene are small, removal of the 3q.ITR results in myo- 
blast morphologies which exhibit extended processes (Lloyd 
and Gunning, 1993). It is possible that this result may reflect 
a failure to control localization of the 3"" actin mRNA. We are 
currently studying the possible specific functions encoded by 
the 3"" actin gene YUTR. 
All mRNA within a cell is associated with the cytoskele- 
ton either directly or indirectly (Hesketh and Pryme, 1991; 
Taneja et al., 1992). The distribution of mRNA is therefore 
related to the cell architecture, which itself responds to ex- 
tracellular and intracellular signals. Actin is intriguing as it 
is both a major component of the cytoskeleton and provides 
its own mRNA distribution. The localization of mRNA may 
well be a signaling mechanism used by the cell to make mor- 
phological decisions. Alternatively, redistributing mRNA 
within the cell may occur in response to morphological deci- 
sions made by other factors. Thus the crucial issue is now 
to define the biological significance of differential actin iso- 
form mRNA localization. This promises to add a new 
dimension to our understanding of the function of the actin 
multigene family.

Summary 
HLA-A2-restricted, CD3 +, CD8 + , ol/B + cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones were isolated from 
peripheral blood (PBL) or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of two HLA-A2 + melanoma 
patients (9742 and 5810), to evaluate the possible recognition of autologous melanoma and of 
allogeneic HLA-A2-matched normal melanocytes. These CTL clones lysed not only fresh and 
cultured autologous melanoma cells, but also allogeneic HLA-A2 +, but not HLA-A2-, normal 
melanocytes. The lysis of autologous neoplastic cells and of melanocytes could be inhibited by 
an anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Lysis of the normal melanocytes was not dependent 
on the presence of human or fetal calf serum in the culture medium. HLA-A2-restricted CTL 
clones recognized not only proliferating melanocytes cultured in complete melanocyte medium, 
but also melanocytes made quiescent by culture for up to 6 d in a basal medium devoid of exogenous 
factors such as phorbol ester (O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate [TPA]), epidermal growth factor, 
insulin, and pituitary extracts. Analysis of specificity of four CTL clones (A75, A83, A94, and 
119) from patient 9742, performed on a panel of 39 targets, indicated that the three HLA- 
A2-restricted CTL (A75, A83, and A94) lysed all but one of nine allogeneic melanomas expressing 
the HLA-A2 molecule with no reactivity on nine HLA-A2- allogeneic melanomas. Only a few 
instances of borderline reactivity were seen by the same effectors on 21 targets of nonmelanocyte 
lineage, including 12 carcinomas of different histology, four Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B 
cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines [LCL]), including the autologous LCL, four lines of normal 
fibroblasts, and normal kidney cells. Lack of reactivity on allogeneic targets of nonmelanocyte 
lineage occurred in spite of expression of HLA-A2 on 14 of these targets as determined by 
conventional tissue typing and cytofluorimetric analysis with four different anti-HLA-A2 mAb. 
These data indicate that tissue-related antigens can be expressed on normal and neoplastic cells 
of the melanocyte lineage and can be recognized in association with HLA-A2 by CTL clones 
from melanoma patients. 
T 
he clonal analysis ofT cell-mediated response to human 
melanoma has indicated that some of the CTL clones 
from a number of patients can recognize tumor-associated 
antigens (TAA) 1 by a TCR-dependent and HLA-restricted 
mechanism (1). These CTL clones are thought to recognize 
TAA by the same mechanism that controls T cell recogni- 
tion of conventional antigens, i.e., as peptides associated with

one of the HLA molecules expressed by the patient's neo- 
plastic cells (2). 
At least two hypotheses have been put forward to explain 
the genesis of the antigenic peptides seen as TAA by autolo- 
gous CTL clones. The first one is that antigenic peptides may 
originate from the intracellular processing of proteins whose 
genes should be expressed in neoplastic but not in normal 
cells. Molecular evidence in agreement with this mechanism 
has been recently obtained for an antigen recognized on mela- 
noma cells in association with HLA-A1 (3). A second possi- 
bility is that the generation of antigenic peptides in human 
tumors is dependent on the presence in the neoplastic cells 
of gene mutations affecting the structure of proteins expressed 
also in normal cells. Evidence consistent with this mecha-

nism has been obtained by analysis of the antigenicity of pep- 
tides corresponding to regions of R.AS oncogenes altered by 
point mutations (4). Both models of TAA generation share 
the assumption that antigens seen by human T lymphocytes 
on neoplastic cells should not be expressed on the normal 
cells of the same tissue (5). However, this hypothesis could 
not be verified in melanoma because of the lack of normal 
cells sharing the appropriate HLA-restricting element and the 
same histological origin with the neoplastic cells recognized 
by tumor-specific and HLA-restricted CTL clones. 
In this study, CTL clones from melanoma patients were 
tested for cytotoxic activity not only on autologous tumor 
but also on allogeneic HLA-A2-matched melanocytes. The 
results indicate that among the PBL or tumor-infiltrating lym- 
phocytes (TIL) of two HLA-A2 + melanoma patients, one 
with primary and the other with metastatic disease, it is pos- 
sible to find some CD3 +, CD8 +, or~f3 + CTL clones that 
lyse autologous and allogeneic HLA-A2 + melanoma cells 
and allogeneic HLA-A2 + normal melanocytes. These data 
show for the first time that tissue-related antigens can be ex- 
pressed on normal and transformed cells of the melanocyte 
lineage and be recognized in an HLA-restricted fashion by 
patients' T lymphocytes. 
Materials and Methods 
Normal and Neoplastic Cells. All melanoma cells used in this 
study were isolated from primary and metastatic lesions obtained 
from surgical specimens of patients admitted for surgery to the 
Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Milan. All tumor and normal cells 
were kept in culture with 10% FCS-RPMI-1640. Melanoma cells 
to be used as stimulators for mixed lymphocyte tumor cultures 
(MLTC) or for T call clones and all targets to be used in cytotoxic 
assays were instead cultured in 10% pooled human serum (PHS)- 
RPMI-1640. Normal human melanocytes (FM 216/A, FM713, 
FM727, and FM741) isolated from neonatal foreskin were cultured 
with a chemically defined medium as described (6). Briefly, the 
melanocyte complete medium (MCM) consisted of a base medium 
with four parts of MCDB 153 medium supplemented with 2 mM 
Ca 2+ and one part of Leibovitz's L15 medium, 5 ng/ml epidermal 
growth factor (EGF), 40/~g/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5/~g/ml 
insulin, 10 ng/ml phorbol ester (TPA) (all from Sigma Im- 
munochemicals, St. Louis, MO), and 2% FCS (ICN Biomedicals, 
Hyland, CA) or 2% PHS. For some experiments MCM was replaced 
with a basal medium lacking EGF, pituitary extract, insulin, and 
TPA. Normal and neoplastic cells were also checked by electron 
microscopy for the absence of mycoplasma contamination and for 
the presence of premelanosomes in cells of the melanocyte lineage. 
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line [LCL] from four mela- 
noma patients (9742, 10538, 1811, and 4405) were produced by 
infection of PBL with supernatant from the EBV producer line 
B95.8 as described (7). 
T Cell Clones. PBL and TIL were isolated as described (7) from 
melanoma patients 9742 (HLA-A2, -A24; -B13, -B18; -Cw6, -Cw7; 
-DR7, -DK11; and -DQ4) and 5810 (HLA-A2, -A24; -B18, -B63; 
-Cw7; -DR6, -DR11; and -DQ1, -DQ7). The lymphocytes 
(106/ml) were cultured for 3-4 wk with autologous irradiated 
(10,000 tad) metastatic (patient 9742) or primary (patient 5810) 
melanoma cells first in 24-well plates (model 3424; Costar Corp., 
Cambridge, MA) and then in 25 cm 2 flasks (model 25100B; Bibby 
Scientific Products Ltd., Stone, UK) at a lymphocyte/tumor ratio 
of 5:1 in 10% PHS-RPMI-1640 in the presence of 50 U/ml of rib2 
(EuroCetus, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The cultures were re- 
stimulated weekly with autologous tumor cells. At the end of 4 wk 
of culture, cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Cloning was per- 
formed as described (7) in 96 round-bottomed well plates (model 
3799; Costar Corp.) with 10% PHS-RPMI-1640 supplemented with 
50 U/ml of rlL-2 in the presence of irradiated autologous tumor 
cells (5 x 103/well) and allogeneic pooled lymphocytes (5 x 
104/well, irradiated at 3,000 tad) from at least three donors as a 
source of feeder cells. Cloning was performed at 5, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 
cells/well. The plates were restimulated with autologous tumor 
cells and feeder cells after 1 wk of culture and screened at day 14 
for the presence of growing clones. On the basis of the cloning 
efficiency, which ranged between 0.5 and 17%, a frequency ofclono- 
genic precursors was evaluated and used to determine the proba- 
bility of clonality of each clone by Poisson statistics as described 
by Taswell et al. (8). Only clones having ap value for true clonality 
of at least 0.95 were used in this study. True clonality of the effectors 
used in this study was confirmed by analysis of TCR-Vot and -V/3 
expressi'on in each clone, performed by RT-PCK with primers 
specific for all known members of the Vc~ and V/$ gene families. 
This analysis revealed that only one Vcr and one VB mRNA was 
exressed by each clone (Senti, M., S. Salvi, C. Castelli, C. Maccalli, 
A. Mazzocchi, R. Mortarini, M. Herlyn, G. Permiani, and A. 
Anichini, manuscript in preparation). 156 clones from patient 9742 
and 223 clones from patient 5810, selected on the basis of a p value 
for clonality >0.95, were screened for cytotoxicity on the autolo- 
gous melanoma and, at the same time, for inhibition of tumor lysis 
by anti-CD3 and anti-HLA class I antibodies. 63 clones from pa- 
tient 9742 (30 from TIL and 33 from PBL) and 28 clones from 
patient 5810 (12 clones from TIL and 16 from PBL) expressed 
significant cytotoxic activity on the autologous tumor, and were 
inhibited by both anti-CD3 and anti-HLA class I mAb. CTL clones 
from patient 9742 were also obtained by direct cloning at 0.5 and 
0.25 cells/well of fresh PBL in the presence of allogeneic irradiated 
PBL, 50 U/ml of rll.,2, and 1% PHA (Difco Laboratories, Inc., 
Detroit, MI). 207 clones with a p value for clonality of 0.96 were 
screened for cytotoxic activity and 21 were cytotoxic on the auto- 
logous tumor and inhibited by anti-HLA class I mAb. All CTL 
clones used in this study expressed a CD3 +, CD4-, CD8 ~, c~/B + 
phenotype as assessed, respectively, with antibodies OKT3 
(CRL8001; American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Rockville, 
MD), OKT4 (CRL8002; ATCC), OKT8 (CRL8014; ATCC) and 
by the anti-TCK-c~/~ mAb WT31 (Becton Dickinson & Co., 
Mountain View, CA). 
Cytotoxicity Assay. 
Target cells (106) were labeled for 90 rain 
at 37~ with 100 #Ci of Na2SlCrO4 (Amersham International, 
Amersham, Bucks, UK). After three washings with cold medium, 
the targets were adjusted to 10Uml in 10~ PHS-RPMI-1640. 
Effectors were resuspended at various concentrations to give final 
effector/target ratios ranging between 50:1 and 5:1. Effectors and 
targets were then seeded in 0.1 ml aliquots in v-bottomed 96-well 
plates (model 3596; Costar Corp.), centrifuged at 60 g for 5 min 
and incubated at 37~ 
5% CO2 for 4 h. At the end of the incu- 
bation time, 0.125 ml of supernatant was collected, mixed with 
0.7 ml of cocktail (Ready-Solve HP 158726; Beckman Instruments, 
Geneva, Switzerland) in Micronic PPN tubes (Flow Laboratories, 
Settimo Milanese, Italy) and counted in a beta counter (model 
LS1801; Beckman Instruments). Results (in cpm) were expressed 
as follows: percent lysis = experimental release - spontaneous re- 
lease/maximum release - spontaneous release, where spontaneous 
release was assessed by incubating target cells in the absence of 
effectors and maximum release was determined in the presence of 
990 
Cytotoxic T Cell-defined Antigens on Mdanoma and Melanocytes 
1% NP-40 detergent (BDH Biochemicals, Poole, UK). Inhibition 
of lysis by mAb to CD3, HLA-A2, HLA class I, and HLA-DR 
antigens was performed by preincubating the effectors or the targets 
with different purified mAb in 0.1 ml for 45 min at 37~ 
Then 
effectors or targets were added in 0.1 ml aliquots and the cytotox- 
icity assay was carried out as described above. The assays were per- 
formed at the final concentration of 1 #g/ml for each mAb. 
Proliferation Assay. Melanocytes were incubated for 48-72 h in 
0.2 ml of MCM or in a basal medium without EGF, pituitary ex- 
tracts, insulin, and TPA in flat-bottomed 96-well plates (model 3595; 
Costar Corp.) at the initial concentration of 2 x 104 cells/well. 
The cultures were pulsed with 1 #Ci [3H]thymidine/well (sp act. 
6.7 Ci/mmol) (Amersham International) during the last 8 h of 
cultures. Each sample was then harvested, absorbed onto nitrocel- 
lulose paper, and washed using a harvester (Titertek; Flow Labora- 
tories). The nitrocellulose filters were dried and counted after liquid 
scintillation in a beta counter (model LS1801; Beckman Instru- 
ments). The proliferation assay was performed in six replicate wells. 
mAb andPhenotypic Analysis. Phenotype of CTL clones, mela- 
nocytes, and all tumor cells was performed by indirect immu- 
nofluorescence followed by cytofluorimetric analysis on a FACScan | 
cytofluorimeter (Becton Dickinson & Co.) as previously described 
(9). The following mAb were used: W6/32 (10), anti-HLA class I; 
CRll.351 (11), BB7.2 (12), PA2.1 (13) and MA2.1 (14), anti-HLA- 
A2; R24 (15), antiganglioside GD3; 528 (16), anti-EGF-receptor; 
17Fll (17), anti-c-kit protein; C350 (18), anti-gp180; B5.2 (18), anti- 
melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (mCSP); $27 (19), 
anti-adenosine deaminase binding protein (ADAbp); ME20.4 (6), 
anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor; ME9-61 (6), anti-p97 
melanotransferrin; TA99 (20), anti-gp75 tyrosinase-related glyco- 
protein; TR66 (21), anti-CD3; 84H10 (22), anti-intercellular adhe- 
sion molecule 1 (ICAM-1); and TS2/9 (23) anti-LFA-3. 
Results 
Lysis of Autologous HLA-A2 § Tumor and Anogeneic HLA- 
A2 § Metanowtes by CTL Clones from TIL and PBL of Mela- 
noma Patients. Table 1 shows the biological characterization 
of the human newborn foreskin melanocytes used in this study. 
All melanocytes are pigmented cells; have a bipolar/spindle 
morphology; grow as anchorage-dependent cells; are not 
tumorigenic when injected into nude mice; have a normal 
diploid karyotype, undergo senescence after a limited number 
of passages in vitro; and three out of four depended on the 
presence of phorbol ester for growth. By cytofluorimetric 
analysis, all these cells express HLA class I antigens as de- 
tected by the antibody w6/32 (10). In addition, melanocytes 
FM741 and FM727 are positive for HLA-A2 after staining 
with the anti-HLA-A2 antibody CRll.351 (11), whereas the 
melanocytes FM216/A and FM713 do not react with the mAb. 
The expression of HLA-A2 on melanocytes FM741 and FM727 
and the lack of this determinant on FM713 and FM216/A 
was confirmed by conventional HLA tissue typing and by 
immunofluorescence with three additional anti-HLA-A2 mAb, 
MA2.1 (13), BB7.2 (12), and PA2.1 (14) (data not shown). 
All other phenotypic markers were similarly expressed on 
the four melanocyte cultures. In fact, as described for prolifer- 
ating melanocytes in vitro (6, 24), all melanocytes expressed 
the ganglioside GD3 (15) and a low but significant amount 
of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (22). All melanocytes 
991 
Anichini et al. 
reacted significantly with an anti-LFA-3 antibody (23). In 
addition, all melanocytes were weakly positive for the EGF 
receptor (16) and for mCSP, which are considered early markers 
of melanocyte differentiation (18), but were strongly posi- 
tive for gp180, recognized by antibody C350, a late marker 
of melanocyte differentiation (18). Also, all cells expressed 
the tyrosinase-related gp75 marker (20), the NGF receptor 
(6), and p97, melanotransferrin (6). Furthermore, all mela- 
nocytes expressed the product of the c-kit gene (17) and ADAbp 
(19), two antigens that are expressed on normal melanocytes 
but that are lost on melanoma cell lines (19, 25). 
These melanocytes were used as targets to screen CTL clones 
from two HLA-A2 + melanoma patients. CTL clones with 
cytolytic activity on melanocytes were isolated from a larger 
panel of 112 CTL clones initially selected for: (a) cytotoxic 
activity on the autologous tumor; and (b) blocking of mela- 
noma lysis by anti-CD3 and anti-HLA class I mAb. Table 
2 shows that some of these effectors, sharing a CD3 + CD8 + 
WT31 + phenotype and isolated from PBL or TIL of two 
HLA-A2 + melanoma patients, could lyse not only the au- 
tologous tumor but also some allogeneic melanocytes. Lysis 
of autologous tumor by CTL clones A75, A81, A83, A94, 
A103, A37, A54, and 211, but not 119, could be inhibited 
by preincubating melanoma cells with the anti-HLA-A2 mAb 
CRll.351. This is in agreement with the known blocking 
activity of this mAb. In fact, a previous report from this lab- 
oratory has shown that antibody CKll.351 can block the 
lysis of any HLA-A2 + target by an alloreactive HLA- 
A2-specific CTL clone (26). In addition, only allogeneic 
melanocytes expressing HLA-A2 (FM741 and FM727) were 
recognized by the same effectors, suggesting an HLA-A2- 
restricted recognition of antigens expressed on autologous 
melanoma and allogeneic normal melanocytes. Clone 119 
represents an example of the many CTL clones isolated from 
the two patients that did not recognize allogeneic HLA-A2 + 
melanocytes and were not blocked by mAb CRll.351 in the 
lysis on the autologous tumor, thus indicating that clones 
such as 119 are not HLA-A2 restricted. 
Cytolytic Activity on Normal Melanocytes by CTL Clones Is 
HLA-A2 Restricted and Not Dependent on the Proliferative Status 
of the Target Cells or on Composition of the Melanocyte Culture 
Medium. 
Table 3 shows that the lysis of HLA-A2 + mela- 
nocytes by two different CTL clones (CTL A83 and CTL 
A94) from patient 9742 could be inhibited by preincubating 
the targets with the anti-HLA-A2 mAb CRll.351, indicating 
that the recognition of these cells occurs by the same mecha- 
nism seen for the lysis of the autologous melanoma. Also, 
lysis of melanocytes was not due to the presence of bovine 
or human serum in the culture medium. In fact, HLA-A2 + 
melanocytes were equally lysed after culture for at least 2 wk 
in the presence of either 2% FCS or 2% PHS, whereas one 
HLA-A2- melanocyte was not recognized after culture in 
the presence of either FCS or PHS. 
We next tested the possibility that the proliferative status 
of the melanocytes might influence antigen recognition by 
CTL clones. In fact, and in agreement with the data of Table 
1, it is known that proliferating human melanocytes in cul- 
ture can undergo phenotypic changes characterized by de novo

All melanocytes (FM741, FM727, FM713, and FM216/A) grow in liquid culture as adherent cells but do not grow in semisolid medium (0.35% 
agarose). Tumorigenicity was tested by subcutaneous injection of 106 cells into nude mice. 
* Phenotype of proliferating melanocytes kept in MCM was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence with the indicated antibodies. Expression 
of gp75 was measured on permeabilized cells. Expression of HLA-A2 on melanocytes was tested with identical results also with antibodies PA2.1 
(13), BB7.2 (12), and MA2.1 (14).

expression of serologicaUy defined antigens normally found 
on melanoma but not on resting melanocytes (6, 24) such 
as the ganglioside GD3 and ICAM-1. However, antigenic 
recognition of melanocytes by CTL dones was seen not only 
on proliferating cells, as when using target melanocytes cul- 
tured in MCM, but also on growth-arrested cells. In fact (Table 
3), HLA-A2 + quiescent melanocytes, obtained by culture for 
up to 6 d in a basal medium devoid of all main exogenous 
factors (EGF, insulin, TPA, and pituitary extracts), were still 
recognized, even though with less efhciency, by CTL clones 
A83 and A94. However, the quiescent melanocytes were rec- 
ognized with lower efficiency also by LAK cells, the positive 
control of lysability. A possible reason for the reduced lysa- 
bility of resting melanocytes was found, through FACS | anal- 
ysis, by comparing the phenotype of proliferating and quies- 
cent cells. In fact, HLA class I antigens and HLA-A2 molecules 
were expressed at similar levels, whereas ICAM-1 was absent 
on resting cells (data not shown). 
In addition, as seen for proliferating melanocytes, the lysa- 
bility of growth-arrested melanocytes was not influenced by 
presence of FCS or of PHS in the basal medium (data not 
shown). Test of lysis with quiescent melanocytes maintained 
in basal medium for more than 6 d could not be performed 
because substantial cell death ensued after this time point.

Lysis of autologous tumor (Me9742 or Me5810) and of allogeneic melanocytes by CTL clones isolated from TIL or PBL of two melanoma patients 
was tested in a 4-h 5:Cr-release assay at the E/T ratio of 10:1. 
* CTL clones A75, A81, A83, A94, A103, 211 (isolated from PBL), A37, and A54 (isolated from TIL) were obtained after MLTC, whereas clone 
119 (isolated from PBL) was obtained by direct cloning of fresh PBL in the presence of 1% PHA. LAK cells were produced by culturing allogeneic 
PBL from a normal donor in the presence of 100 U/ml of rlL-2 for 1 wk. 
* Lysis of Me9742 and of Me5810 was tested with or without preincubating target cells with 1/~g/ml of the anti-HLA-A2 mAb CRll.351. 
S Results expressed as percent lysis. Underlined values represent significant values of lysis in comparison to the spontaneous release of each target - 
(SNK test p - 0.01). 
tl Lysis of the target in the presence of mAb is significantly different from lysis of the same target in the absence of mAb (SNK test, p = 0.01). 
These data indicate that some antimelanoma CTL clones can 
react in an HLA-A2-dependent fashion to antigens expressed 
on proliferating and resting normal melanocytes. 
HLA-A2-restricted CTL Clones Lyse only HLA-A2 + Cells 
of the Melanocyte Lineage. Table 4 shows the analysis of 
specificity of three of the CTL clones from patient 9742 that 
lysed allogeneic HLA-A2 + melanocytes (CTL A75, CTL 
A83, and CTL A94) and of one CTL clone that did not kill 
these cells (CTL 119). As expected, on the basis of the selec- 
tion criteria adopted to isolate these clones, the lysis of autol- 
ogous tumor by all clones, but not by control LAK cells, 
was inhibited by two different anti-CD3 antibodies (OKT3 
and TR66) and by the anti-HLA class I mAb W6/32, but 
not by a control anti-HLA-DR mAb (L243) (27). CTL clones 
A75, A83, and A94 lysed all but one (Me4855) allogeneic 
melanomas expressing HLA-A2, but did not lyse the mela- 
nomas lacking this determinant, with the exception of a bor- 
derline reactivity by CTL clone A83 on melanomas 665/1 
and 4405. In addition, all four CTL clones failed to lyse the 
two HLA-A2 + LCL obtained by EBV infection of PBL from 
the HLA-A2 + patients 9742 (i.e., the autologous LCL) and 
10538. All clones expressed borderline or no lytic activity 
on most of the allogeneic and normal cells of nonmelanocyte 
lineage, including 12 carcinomas of different histology, four 
lines of normal fibroblasts (F1338/1, F8536, F9203, F3046), 
and normal kidney ceils (Re458), even though HLA-A2 was 
expressed on 10 of these targets. Only one of the HLA-A2- 
restricted clones (A83) expressed a low but signifcant lytic 
activity on two HLA-A2 + fibroblasts (F1338/1 and F3046) 
and on one HLA-A2 + renal carcinoma (Reca458). 
The specificity of CTL clone 119 indicated that additional 
antigenic determinants, seen in association with HLA class 
I alleles which are different from HLA-A2, must be expressed 
on melanoma 9742. In fact, Table 4 shows that the cytotoxic 
activity of this clone on the autologous tumor is inhibited 
by antibodies to CD3 and to HLA class I antigens, indicating 
that this clone acts by a TCR-dependent and HLA dass I- 
restricted mechanism. Lack of lysis of allogeneic targets, either 
in the melanocyte or in the nonmelanocyte lineage by CTL 
119 might be dependent on the presence of unique antigens 
seen only on Me9742 cells or on the lack of appropriate re- 
striction element on the allogeneic targets. The latter possi- 
bility is in agreement with the observation made by com- 
paring the HLA phenotype of the tumor 9742 with that of 
the allogeneic targets used for the specificity assay (data not 
shown). This comparison revealed the existence of a few

Lysis of melanocytes was tested in a 4-h slCr-release assay at the E/T ratio of 10:1. CTL A83 and A94 derived from MLTC of PBL from Patient 
9742. LAK cells were produced as described in the legend to Table 2. 
* Melanocytes were cultured in MCM as described in Materials and Methods in the presence of either 2% FCS or 2% PHS for at least 2 wk before 
using them in the cytolytic assay. The basal medium consisted of MCDB 153 plus L15 without EGF, insulin, pituitary extract, and TPA. After 
48 h of culture in MCM the [3H]thymidine incorporation by FM727 and FM741 was 6,603 +_ 522 cpm and 5,887 _+ 634 cpm, respectively. 
[3H]Thymidine incorporation of the same cells after 48 h of culture in basal medium was 467 _+ 201 cpm (FM727) and 672 _+ 310 cpm (FM741). 
pH]Thymidine incorporation of FM727 and FM741 became negligible after 72 h of culture in basal medium and the cells began to die progressively 
after 144 h. 
* Lysis of melanocytes was inhibited by preincubating the targets with 1 #g/ml of the mAb CRll.351. 
S Results expressed as percent lysis. Underlined values represent significant values of cytotoxicity in comparison to the spontaneous release of each 
target (SNK test, p = 0.01).

matches for HLA-A2, -A24, -B18, -Cw6, and -Cw7, but no 
matches were available for the HLA class I allele B13 expressed 
by 9742 cells. 
Finally, all clones shown in Table 4 lysed not only the cul- 
tured tumor, but also the fresh, uncultured melanoma, even 
though to a lesser extent than the cultured tumor. However, 
the fresh tumor was recognized with lower efficiency than 
the cultured tumor also by LAK cells used as positive con- 
trol of target lysability. By cytofluorimetric analysis, the fresh 
tumor expressed, in comparison with the cultured tumor, 
lower amounts of HLA class I, HLA-A2 antigens, and of 
two main adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and LFA-3 (data not 
shown). The reduced expression of these critical determinants 
of the effector-target interaction may explain the reduced lys- 
ability of the fresh tumor. 
Taken together, the results of the specificity analysis indi- 
cate that CTL clones such as A75, A83, and A94 recognize, 
in a TCR-dependent and HLA class I-restricted fashion, an- 
tigenic determinants preferentially expressed on normal and 
neoplastic cells of the melanocyte lineage and seen in associa- 
tion with HLA-A2. 
Discussion 
The results of this study indicate that some HLA class 
I-restricted CTL clones from melanoma patients can recognize 
HLA-A2 § normal and neoplastic cells of the melanocyte lin- 
eage. This suggests that at least some of the antigens de- 
tected by T lymphocytes from melanoma patients might be 
related to the expression of tissue-related genes. A possibility 
is that peptides seen by the CTL clones in association with 
HLA-A2 derive from the processing of proteins encoded by 
genes preferentially expressed in cells of the melanocyte lin- 
eage. Alternatively, one should hypothesize the existence of 
tissue-specific differences in the mechanisms of antigen pro- 
cessing. These differences might lead, in different cell types, 
to the production and assembly with HLA-A2 of different 
peptides not necessarily originating from tissue-specific pro- 
teins. Both these hypotheses are in agreement with the lack 
of significant reactivity observed by CTL clones as A75, A83, 
and A94 on most HLA-A2 § normal and neoplastic cells of 
nonmelanocyte antigen. 
The experiments performed with quiescent melanocytes 
994 
Cytotoxic T Cell-defined Antigens on Melanoma and Melanocytes 
suggested that the HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones recognize 
antigens whose expression is not restricted to proliferating 
cells. This is true for the significant lysis seen up to 144 h 
after seeding melanocytes in conditions that completely ar- 
rest their proliferation. We cannot rule out the possibility 
that CTL-mediated recognition of the quiescent melanocytes 
may disappear after 144 h of culture in conditions of growth 
arrest. However, experiments of CTL-mediated lysis on quies- 
cent cells beyond the 144 h limit could not be performed 
because of the death of the melanocytes when cultured in 
the basal medium for periods longer than 6 d. On the other 
hand, our data indicate that the same CTL clones that can 
recognize the HLA-A2 + melanocytes can also kill the fresh, 
uncultured autologous melanoma. This is consistent with 
the recognition of antigens expressed in vivo at least by the 
neoplastic cells. Clearly, it remains to be seen whether fresh, 
uncultured melanocytes, directly purified from patients' tissues, 
can be recognized by these CTL clones. In fact, the avail- 
ability of autologous, uncultured melanocytes would allow 
one to perform the critical experiment that may formally prove 
whether antigens recognized by T cells on melanoma are also 
expressed in vivo on normal cells of the same tissue. A finding 
ofCTL lysis on fresh uncultured melanocytes might strengthen 
the hypothesis that an immune mechanism could lead to de- 
struction of melanocytes and melanoma in vivo and might 
also be interpreted as an indication that it is possible to alter 
an existing state of tolerance to tissue-related self antigens. 
Indeed, these hypotheses are in agreement with the develop- 
ment of an unexpected form of toxicity recently described 
in a proportion of melanoma patients subjected to a protocol 
that sequentially combined chemotherapy with IL-2 plus 
IFN-c~ (28). In fact, those authors reported for the first time 
that a depigmentation, defined as ""vitiligo-like"" and surely 
resulting from melanocyte destruction, occurred in a propor- 
tion of the treated patients. More importantly, this ""toxicity"" 
correlated significantly with tumor regression. These results 
suggested to the authors (28) that the combination of che- 
motherapy with immunotherapy, but not each of the two 
components alone, might activate a process leading to in vivo 
destruction of normal and neoplastic cells of the melanocyte 
lineage. Thus, although the precise mechanism of melanoma 
and melanocyte destruction in vivo remains to be elucidated, 
the possibility of an immune recognition of antigens shared 
between normal and neoplastic cells of the melanocyte lin- 
eage is supported by our results. 
The findings described here add new information on the 
antigenicity of human melanoma and on the role of HLA- 
A2 molecule in the immune recognition of this tumor. In 
fact, the available data suggest that the HLA-A2 molecule 
is an immunodominant class I allele for presentation of mela- 
noma antigens to autologous cytotoxic T cells (29), and that 
common melanoma antigens can be expressed by HLA-A2- 
melanomas after transfection with HLA-A2 (30). These data 
indicated that most human melanomas are antigenic and that 
most tumors from HLA-A2 + patients may share common 
melanoma antigens seen by cytotoxic T cells. Our results 
confirmed the data on the existence of common melanoma 
antigens seen in association with HLA-A2. However, the 
findings described here suggest also that at least a proportion 
of these common antigens detected by patients' T cells on 
the tumor are not necessarily expressed as consequence of 
neoplastic transformation, but may represent a property of 
the tissue of origin of the tumor, since cultured normal me- 
lanocytes can be recognized by the same CTL clones that 
recognize all HLA-A2 + melanomas. A possibility is that the 
origin of the antigens recognized by our CTL clones on mela- 
noma and melanocytes may be linked to the differentiation 
program of cells in the melanocyte lineage. In fact, antigens 
expressed on newborn and fetal, but not adult melanocytes, 
were found also on the subset of tumors characterized as being 
in an intermediate stage of differentiation (18). With respect 
to this classification, it is interesting that we used neonatal 
foreskin melanocytes as targets for the screening of CTL clones. 
If antigens detected by T cells on melanoma are associated 
to the differentiation program of melanocytes, as it happens 
for serologically defined antigens, then it is possible that the 
CTL clones described in this study are directed to antigens 
that may be differentially expressed among normal or neo- 
plastic melanocytes corresponding to distinct phases in the 
differentiation program of this lineage. This hypothesis im- 
plies that the heterogeneity for differentiation stage, com- 
monly found among melanomas from different patients (18), 
should correlate with heterogeneity for expression of T 
cell-defined antigens. Therefore not all HLA-A2 + mela- 
nomas may be recognized by CTL clones such as those de- 
scribed in our study. This is in agreement with the observa- 
tion that one out of nine HLA-A2 + melanomas was not 
lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones. Similar possi- 
bilities exist for the recognition of melanocytes. However, 
the issue of differential expression of tissue related antigens 
on normal melanocytes might be settled only by testing the 
CTL clones on HLA-A2 + melanocytes isolated from fetal, 
newborn, and adult skin. 
In addition, the lack of lysis seen on one (Me4855) of the 
HLA-A2 § melanomas might not be dependent on antigenic 
heterogeneity linked to the differentiation stage of the tumors. 
In fact, some patients may express rare HLA-A2 alleles that 
cannot be discriminated serologicaUy, but that are readily dis- 
tinguished by T cells (31), since the HLA-A2 subtype poly- 
morphism produces changes in the peptide-binding groove 
that can affect peptide presentation (31). Therefore, it is pos- 
sible that absence of recognition of some melanomas by the 
CTL clones described in this study is dependent on the pres- 
ence of distinct HLA-A2 subtypes in the population. The 
answer to this possible explanation of heterogeneity in CTL- 
mediated recognition of melanomas will be obtained by ap- 
plying a recently described technique of DNA typing for HLA- 
A2 subsets (32). 
We do not know whether all HLA-A2-restricted CTL 
clones from each patient will kill HLA-A2 + melanocytes. In 
fact, it is possible that the CTL clones detected in this study 
may represent only a fraction of the HLA-A2-restricted killers 
and that other HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones may kill the 
tumor but not HLA-matched melanocytes. Only the screening

Specificity of CTL clones A75, A83, A94, and 119 from patient 9742 was tested in a 4-h slCr-release assay. LAK cells were produced as described 
in the legend to Table 2. 
* Reactivity of different cells with the mAb CRll.351 (anti-HLA-A2) is expressed as percent positive cells by cytofluorimetric analysis. Positive 
reaction with CRll.351 was confirmed also by the mAb anti-HLA-A2 PA2.1, BB7.2, and MA2.1. All targets in the panel are positive for HLA 
class I antigens as detected by the mAb W6/32 (10). 
* Inhibition of Me9742 lysis was performed by preincubating the effectors with 1 #g/ml of anti-CD3 mAb OKT3('*) or TR66(***), and prein- 
cubating the target with 1 gg/ml of W6/32 (anti-HLA-class I), or L243 (anti-HLA-DR). 
S Results are expressed as percent lysis. Underlined values represent significant values of lysis (SNK test, p = 0.01). 
II Lysis in the presence of antibodies is significantly different from lysis of the same target in the absence of antibody (SNK test, p z 0.01). LCL9742, 
LCL10538, LCL1811, and LCL4405 are lymphoblastoid cell lines autologous respectively to the tumors Me9742, Me10538, Me1811, and Me4405. 
Re458 kidney cells and fibroblasts F3046 are autologous respectively to the tumors Reca458 and Me3046/2. 
of a large panel of HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones for lysis 
of melanoma and melanocytes will indicate whether the HLA- 
A2 molecule is a restriction element only for antigens shared 
between melanoma and melanocytes, or also for antigens ex- 
pressed on the neoplastic cells only. 
The CTL clones with reactivity on normal melanocytes 
were found not only in PBL but also in TIL. This indicates 
that HLA-A2-restricted T cells with the ability to recognize 
normal and neoplastic cells of the melanocyte lineage are not 
confined to a single tissue but can be found either in the pe- 
ripheral circulation or the tumor site. However, the analysis 
performed by T cell clones, due to the strong selection that 
occurs during the cloning procedure, does not allow us to 
draw any conclusion on the issue of frequency of these effectors 
either in the PBL or in the TIL populations. This issue may 
be addressed only by analysis of tile molecular structure of 
the TCK expressed by these effectors (Sensi, M., et al., manu- 
script in preparation). 
Finally, the results of the specificity assay performed with 
CTL clone 119 indicated that HLA-A2 is not the only re- 
stricting element for recognition of TAA on tumor 9742 and 
that some of the T cell-defined antigens of this tumor may 
not be frequently shared with allogeneic cells even within 
the melanocyte lineage. This suggests that the antigenicity 
of a human melanoma, as defined by autologous cytotoxic 
T cells, may be a complex phenotype resulting not only from 
heterogeneity in the tissue distribution and molecular origin 
of the antigens, but also from the expression on the same 
tumor of common or unique antigens, and from the pres- 
ence of distinct peptide-HLA complexes.

Summary 
Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of myocardial depression in clinical and ex- 
perimental septic shock. This depression is associated with the presence of a circulating myo- 
cardial depressant substance with physical characteristics consistent with cytokines. The present 
study utilized an in vitro myocardial cell assay to examine the role of various human recombi- 
nant cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)ot and interleukin (IL)113, in depression of 
cardiac myocyte contractile function induced by serum from humans with septic shock. The 
extent and velocity of electrically paced rat cardiac myocytes in tissue culture was quantified by 
a closed loop video tracking system. Individually, TNF-0c and IL-113 each caused significant 
concentration-dependent depression of maximum extent and peak velocity of myocyte short- 
ening in vitro. In combination, TNF-cx and IL-1[3 induced depression of myocardial cell con- 
tractility at substantially lower concentrations consistent with a synergistic effect. Using immu- 
noabsorption, removal of both TNF-cx and IL-113 (but not either alone) from the serum of five 
patients with acute septic shock and marked reversible myocardial depression resulted in elimi- 
nation of serum myocardial depressant activity. IL-2, -4, -6, -8, -10, and interferon ~/failed to 
cause significant cardiac myocyte depression over a wide range of concentrations. These data 
demonstrate that TNF-0t and IL-113 cause depression of myocardial cell contraction in vitro 
and suggest that these two cytokines act synergistically to cause sepsis-associated myocardial de- 
pression in humans. 
D 
espite therapy with appropriate antibiotics and inten- 
sive supportive care, septic shock remains a serious 
disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. The typical 
human cardiovascular response to septic shock is character- 
ized by hypotension, decreased systemic vascular resistance, 
and elevated cardiac index. In addition, myocardial depres- 
sion manifested by reversible biventricular dilation and re- 
duction of ejection fraction has been shown to be common 
in human septic shock (1-3). 
A previously described in vitro model of myocardial cell 
performance utilizes spontaneously beating rat cardiac my- 
ocytes in culture (4-6). This system allows assessment of myo- 
cardial cell performance (i.e., contraction) independent of 
changes in preload, afterload, and heart rate. In this system, 
serum from patients with acute septic shock produced in 
vitro depression of cardiac myocyte contractile function (de- 
creased maximum extent and peak velocity of shortening) 
that correlated quantitatively and temporally with the de- 
pression of ventricular ejection fraction seen in the same 
patients in vivo. This suggested the presence of a poten- 
tially pathophysiologicaUy relevant myocardial depressant 
substance or substances (5, 6). The identity or identifies of 
the specific molecule(s) responsible for this myocardial de- 
pression have not been determined. 
A number of exogenous and endogenous mediators have 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock includ- 
ing endotoxin, complement components (particularly CSa), 
histamine, kinins, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, endorphins 
and cytokines (7, 8). Potentially, any of these could have 
myocardial depressant effects. However, recent studies have 
suggested that the myocardial depressant substance (or sub- 
stances) of septic shock possesses physical properties and a 
molecular mass (10-30 kD) consistent with cytokines (4, 
9). Cytokines that may potentially contribute to septic myo- 
cardial depression include TNF-cx, IL-113, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, 
IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-~/. Each is known to be involved in 
inflammatory states, and serum levels of most are elevated 
in endotoxic and/or septic shock. 
The hypothesis of this study was that one or more of 
these factors may be a myocardial depressant and may ac- 
count for some or all of the cardiac depression associated 
with human septic shock. This study was designed to eval- 
uate whether these factors could act as direct myocardial 
depressant substances in an in vitro model of myocardial

function and whether elimination of these substances from 
human septic serum would attenuate its in vitro myocardial 
depressant activity, 
Materials and Methods 
The methods employed were a modification of those previ- 
ously described (4-6). The basic myocyte assay is designed to 
measure the depression or enhancement of contractility of beat- 
ing cardiac myocytes in cell culture caused by agents that are in- 
troduced into the growth medium. Spontaneously beating new- 
born rat myocardial cells were established using a modification of 
the technique described by Harary and Farley (10). Using sterile 
technique, hearts from 2-d-old Lewis rat pups were removed, 
pooled, and minced into small blocks. The cells were disaggre- 
gated with 0.15% bovine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma Chemical Co., 
St. Louis, MO) in a modified HBSS (potassium, calcium, and 
magnesium free; GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). Suspensions 
were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm (500 g) for 15 min and plated into 
35 • 10 mm petri dishes at a density of 300,000 cells/ml. Plating 
media (standard control media) consisted of 25% Hepes-buffered 
Medium 199 and 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (both 
from GIBCO BIKL) diluted in a balanced salt solution and sup- 
plemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (all from 
Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells were incubated at 37~ in 5% CO2 
and growth media was changed every 48 h. After plating, cells 
became confluent and began spontaneously beating within 4 d. 
Latex microbeads were introduced into the culture after 4 d and 
affixed themselves to cell membranes. Beating cells were used for 
the assay between 5 and 10 d after plating. 
All pipettes, plates, and other equipment used for preparation, 
culture, or testing of cardiac myocytes were endotoxin tested and 
disposable. All liquid media contained < 1 pg/ml endotoxin with 
the exception of newborn calf serum which contained 0.48 ng/ 
ml endotoxin. All recombinant cytokines contained <50 pg en- 
dotoxin per big cytokine. Culture media, cytokine solutions, and 
other test solutions were tested for endotoxin content using a 
quantitative, chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Whit- 
taker M.A. Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD). 
The extent and velocity of myocardial cell shortening during 
cell contraction was assayed by a modification of previously de- 
scribed techniques (4--6). The petri dish containing beating myo- 
cardial cells was fastened to the heated (37~ 
stage of an inverted- 
optics, phase-contrast microscope that had an attached video 
camera. A television monitor displayed the image of the target 
cells. A custom-built electronic tracking system was used to quan- 
titate the movement of a latex bead selected from the many beads 
attached to the membranes of beating myocytes. The typical maxi- 
mum initial extent of rhythmic displacement of the bead was be- 
tween 3 and 10 p,m, depending on the length of the myocyte to 
which it was adherent. The tracking system produced analog sig- 
nals that were relayed to an intervening electronic instrument 
(which derived contraction velocity from rate of change of bead 
displacement) and a two-channel strip chart recorder that printed 
an analog recording of extent and velocity of bead displacement. 
To ensure a fixed contraction frequency, a custom-built alternat- 
ing current electrical pulse generator was used to pace myocytes 
(12 V, maximum 40 mA, 0.7-7-ms pulse duration). The mini- 
mum current and pulse duration required to effectively pace car- 
diac myocytes was used for each experiment. 
Each individual assay was performed as follows. Plates were re- 
moved from the incubator and fresh growth media applied. Plates 
were mounted on the microscope stage and myocytes were paced 
to 60 contractions per rain. An appropriate bead was located and 
the extent and velocity ofmyocyte shortening measured for 5 rain 
(baseline contractility). If extent of cell contraction was stable 
(maximum 2.5% variation over 5 rain), a test or control solution 
was added. Subsequently, measurements of maximum extent and 
peak velocity of myocyte shortening and velocity were obtained 
every 5 min for 30 rain. By comparing the maximum extent and 
peak velocity of shortening at each 5-rain interval to the baseline 
value, changes were referenced to initial contractility. 
Five groups of experiments were performed. (a) Human re- 
combinant TNF-o~ and IL-113 were initially assayed (each along 
with controls) in order to evaluate whether either cytokine could 
individually produce concentration-dependent depression of car- 
diac myocyte shortening. The concentrations tested were: for 
TNF-ee (Sigma Chemical Co.), 0 (control), 0.0125, 0.05, 0.2, 0.8, 
3.2, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 ng/ml (n = 8 each concentration); for 
IL-I~ (Endogen, Inc., Boston, MA), 0 (control), 2, 8, 32, 125, 
500, and 1,000 ng/ml (n = 8 each concentration). Test media 
consisted of standard culture media (as previously described) with 
the addition of the specified cytokine concentrations. 
Reversibility of depression induced by TNF-ot (50 ng/ml) and 
IL-1 [3 (500 ng/ml) was individually determined by repeated wash- 
out with standard control media (n = 8 each group). 5 min after 
washing, maximum extent and peak velocity of shortening was 
determined and compared to the level of depression of similarly 
washed cardiac myocytes exposed only to control media. 
In addition, cardiac myocytes were separated from nonmyo- 
cytes by centrifugation through a Percoll step gradient (Sigma 
Chemical, Co.) resulting in a >95-98% pure cardiac myocyte 
culture (viable cardiac myocytes/all viable cells). Myocyte purity 
was determined 48 h after plating by a combination oftrypan blue 
exclusion to differentiate viable and nonviable cells followed by 
differentiation ofmyocytes from nonmyocytes by cell contraction 
in response to an electrical pulse. TNF-ot (50 ng/ml) and IL-I[~ 
(500 ng/ml) were individually tested for effects on cardiac myo- 
cyte maximum extent and peak velocity of shortening using puri- 
fied cardiac myocyte cultures (n = 8 each group). 
(b) In a second group of experiments, combinations of TNF-c~ 
and IL-113 were evaluated at lower concentrations to evaluate the 
possible additive or synergistic effects of these cytokines. In addi- 
tion to a control solution without either cytokine, paired test 
concentrations of TNF-~/IL-I[3 (ng/ml) included (a) 0.003: 
0.125; (b) 0.0125:0.5; (c) 0.05:2; (d) 0.2:8 (n = 8 each group). 
Test media consisted of standard culture media as described with 
the addition of the specified cytokine concentrations. 
(c) To determine the specific roles of TNF-ot and IL-113 in car- 
diac myocyte depression induced by human septic serum, these 
cytokines were removed from serum by immunoabsorption. Se- 
rum from five human survivors with acute septic shock associated 
with marked, reversible depression of left ventricular ejection 
fraction (mean + standard deviation left ventricular ejection frac- 
tion 26 _ 7% during septic shock, 55 + 7% at recovery; mean 
absolute decrease 28 + 10%) was studied. Each serum sample had 
also been previously documented to contain myocardial depres- 
sant activity. Serum was treated by exposing it overnight (16 h) at 
4~ 
to agarose beads bonded to specific rabbit-derived anti- 
human cytokine polyclonal antibodies (Endogen, Inc.). Serum 
was treated with antibodies against recombinant human TNF-~x, 
recombinant human IL-IJ3, both, or neither (native antibodies 
derived from rabbits before immunization with recombinant hu- 
man TNF-oe or IL-I[3). Each serum sample had TNF-ot and IL- 
l13 concentrations determined by ELISA (TNF-ot by T Cell Sci- 
950 
TNF and IL-1 Cause Septic Serum-induced Myocardial Cell Depression 
ences, Inc., Boston, MA; IL-l[3 by Citron Biotechnologies, Pine 
Brook, NJ) (11). The lower limit of detection in these assays was 
20 pg/ml. 
Insuf[icient serum remained after performing the contractility 
assay to test cytokine concentrations after treatment. However, 
effectiveness of the cytokine immunoahsorption process was con- 
firmed by adding TNF-ot (50 ng/ml) or IL-l[3 (500 ng/ml) to 
standard media (with 10% serum), similarly treating that serum to 
remove TNF-u or IL-113 using specific polyclonal antibodies, 
measuring remaining TNF-cx or IL-113 by ELISA, and confirm- 
ing elimination of depressant activity in the cardiac myocyte con- 
tractility assay. 
Test solutions were created by mixing standard plating media 
without serum with the resultant (antibody-treated) human septic 
serum at a concentration of 10%. Four groups (and a control 
group) were tested to determine serum-induced changes in maxi- 
mum extent and peak velocity of cardiac myocyte shortening. 
The control solution consisted of 10% neonatal bovine calf serum 
(standard plating media) and was cormnon to all experiments 
(nonseptic control). The test solutions consisted of 10% native 
(septic control), anti-TNF-~, anti-IL-1]3, or anti-TNF-ot and 
anti-IL-113 treated serum (n = 8 each group). Additional control 
solutions in = 8 each group) consisting of 10% newborn calf se- 
rum treated with antibodies against recombinant human TNF-~x, 
recombinant human IL-113, both, or neither (native antibodies 
derived from rabbits before immunization with recombinant hu- 
man TNF-ot or IL-113). 
(d) Six other human recombinant cytokines were also initially 
assayed (each along with controls) in order to evaluate whether 
any could individually produce concentration-dependent depres- 
sion of cardiac myocyte shortening. The concentrations tested 
were: IL-2, 0 (control), 1.6, 8, 40, 200, and 1,000 ng/ml (n = 8 
each concentration); IL-4, 0 (control), 1.6, 8, 40, 200, and 1,000 
ng/ml (n = 6 each concentration); IL-6, 0 (control), 0.5, 5, 20, 
80, 320, 1,250, and 3,000 ng/ml in = 8 each concentration); IL-8, 
0 (control), 1.6, 8, 40, 200, and 1,000 ng/ml (n = 7 each concen- 
tration); IL-10, 0 icontrul), 1.6, 8, 40, 200, and 1,000 ng/ml (n = 
6 each concentration); and IFN-y, 0 icontrol), 4, 16, 64, 250, and 
1,000 ng/ml in = 7 each concentration; all from Endogen, Inc.). 
Where known, cytokine concentrations were selected based 
on a range from one order of magnitude below to two orders of 
magnitude above the serum cytokine concentrations documented 
during human septic shock. Test media consisted of standard cul- 
ture media including 10% neonatal calf serum with the addition 
of the specified cytokine concentrations. 
(e) To study the potential role of endotoxin in cytokine and 
septic shock serum-mediated cardiac myocyte depression, se- 
lected test solutions were depleted ofendotoxin by overnight co- 
incubation with silica bead-bonded endotoxin neutralizing pro- 
tein derived from horseshoe crab amebocytes (Associates of Cape 
Cod, Inc., Falmouth, MA) and then assayed for myocardial de- 
pressant activity as previously described. Test media included 
solutions containing TNF-r 
(50 ng/ml), IL-1[3 (500 ng/ml), 
TNF-0e (0.05 ng/ml) with IL-113 (2 ng/ml), or 10% serum from 
one of the five patients with acute septic shock as well as controls 
containing 10% neonatal calf serum without cytokines or septic 
serum (n = 9 each group). 
Statistical Analysis. 
For cytokine testing, data at all concentra- 
tions and time points were pooled and analyzed by multivariate 
regression to determine whether a significant relationship existed 
between cytokine concentration or time and degree of cardiac 
myocyte depression. 
Data for the change in maximum extent and peak velocity of 
cardiac myocyte shortening (percent change from baseline) were 
plotted as a function of time for each control and test solution 
concentration. Linear regression analysis was employed to fit a 
line for the each resulting plot. For cytokines that were demon- 
strated to exert depressant activity, the slopes of these lines were 
compared to that for the control solution by a two-tailed Stu- 
dent's t test in order to determine at what concentration these 
slopes became significantly different (i.e., at what concentration 
significant depression of cardiac myocyte contractihty occurred). 
In this manner, increased depressant activity was indicated by a 
more negative value for slope of the regression hne. Similarly, if 
any factor caused significant depression, a two-tailed Student's t 
test was used to determine at what time point significant depres- 
sion began. 
Data for the comparison of the effects of TNF-oe and IL-113 on 
purified and unpurified cardiac myocytes were similarly pooled 
for each group. Regression-derived slopes were determined and 
compared to slopes for control media via a two-tailed Student's t 
test. A Bonferonni adjustment for multiple comparisons was apphed 
so that each comparison was considered significant only ifp ~<0.025. 
Similarly, for analysis of antibody-treated septic serum and for 
endotoxin-removal experiments, the slope of the plot for the con- 
trol media was compared to each treatment group by a two-tailed 
Student's t test. A Bonferonni adjustment for multiple compari- 
sons was again made in both sets of experiments so that each com- 
parison was considered significant only ifp ~<0.0125. 
Results 
Effects of TNF-ee or IL-1~8. 
Both TNF-a and IL-113 in- 
dividually exhibited concentration-dependent depression of 
cardiac myocyte contractility. 
TNF-c~-induced depression of maximum extent of car- 
diac myocyte shortening began at a concentration of 0.8 
ng/ml (p <0.05) and progressed through concentrations of 
3.2 (p <0.02), 12.5 (p <0.01), 25 (p <0.01), 50 (p 
<0.001), and 100 ng/ml (p <0.001). Fig. 1 A shows car- 
diac myocyte depression as a function of time for the con- 
trol media without TNF-ot, 0.8 ng/ml TNF-tx, and 100 
ng/ml TNF-a. The slopes of the lines fit to the data at each 
concentration were plotted against the log of the concen- 
trations (Fig. 1 /9). A highly significant relationship (p 
<0.0001) existed, suggesting that increased depression of 
maximum extent of myocyte shortening occurred with in- 
creasing concentrations of TNF-ot. Parallel and similarly 
significant changes in peak velocity of myocyte shortening 
were also demonstrated. 
Significant depression occurred by 10 min (p <0,02) 
with progressively more depression to 30 min (p <0.001) 
for both changes in maximum extent and peak velocity of 
cardiac myocyte shortening. Overall, TNF-R-induced car- 
diac myocyte depression was significandy time dependent 
(p <0.0001). 
IL-l[3-induced depression of maximum extent of cardiac 
myocyte shortening began at a concentration of 32 ng/ml 
(p <0.05) and progressed through concentrations of 128 
(p <0.01), 500 (p <0.01), and 1,000 ng/ml (p <0.001). Fig- 
ure 1 B shows cardiac myocyte depression as a function of 
time for the control media without IL-113, IL-113 32 ng/ml, 
and 1,000 ng/ml IL-113. The slopes of the lines fit to the

data at each concentration were plotted against the log of 
the concentrations (Fig. 1 E). As with TNF-ot, a highly sig- 
nificant relationship (p <0.0001) existed, suggesting that 
increased depression of maximum extent ofmyocyte short- 
erring occurred with increasing concentrations of IL-1I~. 
Data for changes in peak velocity were similar. Also similar to 
TNF-a, significant depression of both maximum extent 
and peak vdocity of cardiac myocyte shortening occurred 
by 10 min (p <0.02) and increased through 30 min (p 
<0.001). Depression was significantly time dependent (p 
<0.0001) in addition to being concentration dependent for 
both maximum extent and peak velocity of cardiac myocyte 
shortening. 
50 ng/ml TNF-ot and 500 ng/ml IL-113 each also pro- 
duced significant depression of both maximum extent and 
peak velocity of shortening (p <0.01 each) when applied to 
highly purified cardiac myocyte tissue cultures (>95-98% 
purity versus normal 75-80%). 
Reversal of 50 ng/ml TNF-0t or 500 ng/ml IL-I[3 in- 
duced depression of maximum extent (and peak velocity) of 
cardiac myocyte contractility could be produced by wash- 
ing the cell monolayer with standard growth media with- 
out cytokine (Fig. 2). Contractile function of cardiac myo- 
cytes reverted to baseline within 5 min of washing the cells 
with cytokine-free media. 
Trypan blue supravital staining failed to demonstrate loss 
of cell viability within the cardiac myocyte culture. No in- 
crease in supematant lactate dehydrogenase was noted before 
and after exposure of cardiac myocytes to TNF-o~ or IL-I~.

Figure 2. Reversibility of cardiac myocyte depresssion induced by 
TNF-ct or IL-1I~. At 5 rain after introduction of TNF-qx or IL-118, myo- 
cyte shortening was similar to control media-exposed cells. 30 rain after 
exposure to TNF-cx or IL-1I~, cardiac myocyte shortening was signifi- 
cantly decreased compared to controls. 5 min after washing with control 
media, shortening of TNF-a- and IL-l~-exposed cardiac myocytes was 
again comparable to similarly washed controls. (*) p <0.01 vs. control

pression of maximum extent of cardiac myocyte shortening 
was present starting at a concentration of 0.0125 ng/ml 
TNF-ct: 0.5 ng/ml IL-1{3 (p <0.05) with increasing de- 
grees of depression with increasing concentrations through 
to 0.2 ng/ml TNF-ot: 8 ng/ml IL-113 (p <0.001; Fig. 1 C). 
A highly significant relationship (p <0.0001) between 
TNF-cx/IL-lJ3 concentration and depression of maximum 
extent of cardiac myocyte shortening existed (Fig. 1 F'). 
Changes in peak velocity of cardiac myocyte shortening 
were once again entirely parallel except that significant de- 
pression was noted beginning with the lowest concentra- 
tion tested, 0.003 ng/ml TNF-cx with 0.125 ng/ml IL-lJ3 
(p <0.05), and progressed through higher concentrations 
to 0.2 ng/ml TNF-ot and 8 ng/ml IL-113 (p <0.001). A 
highly significant relationship between concentration of 
TNF-a/IL-lJ3 and degree of depression of peak velocity of 
cardiac myocyte shortening also existed (p <0.0001). As 
with TNF-ct and IL-1[3 individually, depression of maxi- 
mum extent and peak velocity of shortening was first appar- 
ent by 10 rain (p <0.05), progressed through 30 rain 
(p <0.001), and was, overall, time dependent (p <0.0001) 
in addition to being concentration dependent. 
Immunoabsorption of TNF-ot and IL-l~S from Human Septic 
Serum. Five samples of serum drawn from patients with 
acute septic shock were studied. Measurable TNF-ct con- 
centrations were present in each sample tested before treat- 
ment with anticytokine antibodies. The mean TNF-et con- 
centration of the samples was 72 +- 26 pg/ml (mean +- 
standard deviation). Similarly, IL-1[3 was detectable in un- 
treated serum samples with a mean concentration of 167 -+ 
71 pg/ml. Although insufficient serum remained after im- 
munoabsorption for direct demonstration of cytokine re- 
moval from test (clinical) serum specimens, efficacy of im- 
953 
Kumar et al. 
munoabsorption of TNF-ot and IL-1J3 was confirmed by 
98-99.5% cytokine elimination from standard media with 
10% neonatal bovine serum to which human recombinant 
TNF-ct (50 ng/ml) and IL-113 (500 ng/ml) had been added. 
In addition, such serum was rendered devoid of depressant 
activity in the described cardiac myocyte contractility assay. 
In each case (Fig. 3, A-E), sera treated with preimmune 
rabbit antibodies (septic control) resulted in significant de- 
pression (minimum p <0.01) compared to the 10% non- 
septic neonatal bovine serum (nonseptic control). Treat- 
ment with anti-TNF-ot or anti-IL-l[3 antibody alone also 
resuked in significantly more depression (minimum 
p <0.05, p <0.01 in four of five septic sera) than 10% non- 
septic neonatal bovine serum. Immunoabsorption of both 
TNF-cx and I[.-113 from human septic sera resulted in loss of 
depressant activity compared to preimmune antibody-treated 
sera (minimum p <0.01) for all patient sera (i.e., depression 
similar to nonseptic control). Similar results were found for 
changes in peak velocity of shortening in each case. 
Additional control solutions consisting of 10% newborn 
calf serum treated with antibodies against recombinant hu- 
man TNF-ct, recombinant human IL-lJ3, both, or neither 
(native antibodies derived from rabbits before immuniza- 
tion with recombinant human TNF-cx or IL-113) failed to 
affect maximum extent or peak velocity of cardiac myocyte 
shortening compared to media containing untreated 10% 
newborn calf serum (data not shown). 
Effect of lL-2, -4, -6, -8, -10, and IFN-% 
For IL-2 (Fig. 
4 A), -4 (Fig. 4 B), -6 (Fig. 4 C), -8 (Fig. 4 D), -10 (Fig. 4 
E), and IFN-~/(Fig. 4 F), concentration-dependent depres- 
sion of maximum extent of cardiac myocyte shortening 
was absent over the concentration range tested. Similar re- 
suits were obtained for changes in peak velocity of cardiac 
myocyte shortening for each cytokine tested. 
Effect of Endotoxin Removal from Test Solutions. Each test 
solution from which endotoxin was removed continued to 
demonstrate highly significant depression of maximum ex- 
tent (and peak velocity) of cardiac myocyte shortening: 
TNF-ct, p <0.005; IL-1[3, p <0.001; TNF-ct and IL-lJ3, p 
<0.01; and 10% septic serum, p <0.001. Similar p values 
were generated for peak velocity data. 
Endotoxin concentration in serum-free media was con- 
sistently found to be <5 pg/ml. Media containing 10% 
neonatal calf serum (including those with cytokines) dem- 
onstrated endotoxin concentrations of between 40 and 65 
pg/ml. The patient serum samples employed in this study 
have been evaluated previously as part of another study 
(12). In aggregate, these samples were shown to contain 
440 + 120 pg/ml (mean +- SEM) endotoxin. All test solu- 
tions treated with endotoxin neutralizing protein had en- 
dotoxin concentrations of <5 pg/ml. 
Discussion 
The major finding of this study is that a synergistic inter- 
action of TNF-~t and IL-1[3 may be responsible for the 
myocardial depressant activity of serum from patients with 
acute septic shock. This finding is supported by the experi-

Figure 3. Regression slopes representing the 
change of maximum extent of myocardial cell 
shortening (as a function of time) in response to an-

tient (A-E). Septic serum treated with preimmune 
antibodies (septic control) consistently demonstrated 
greater depressant activity than did nonseptic con- 
tro] serum (minimum p <0.01). Only immunoab- 
sorption of both TNF-~x and IL-1lg from the septic 
sere resulted in attenuation of serum depressant ac- 
tivity so that myocyte contractility was similar to 
nonseptic controls for each patient. Serum immu- 
noabsorbed of TNF-cx and IL-113 exerted signifi- 
cantly less depressant effect on maximum extent of 
cardiac myocyte shortening than did preimmune 
antibody treated (septic control) samples (minimum p <0,0I), A Bonferonni adjustment for multiple comparisons was made so that each comparison was

mental data which demonstrate that immunoabsorption of 
both TNF-~x and IL-113 abrogates in vitro myocardial de- 
pressant activity of serum from humans with acute septic 
shock associated with clinical myocardial depression (de- 
creased left ventricular ejection fraction). This conclusion is 
strengthened by additional data which show that, whereas 
TNFm and IL-113 independently produce a concentra- 
tion-dependent depression of cardiac myocyte contractility, 
the same cytokines in combination produce similar depres- 
sion at far lower concentrations (comparable to those found 
in human septic serum). 
The primary evidence of the importance of an interac- 
tion of TNF-ol and IL-113 during human septic shock is 
provided by experiments involving immunoabsorption of 
TNF-oL, IL-113, or both from human septic serum. This se- 
rum was drawn from patients with acute septic shock and 
marked reversible myocardial depression as evidenced by a 
decreased ejection fraction (26 --- 7% during acute septic 
shock, 55 -+ 7% after recovery) and had been shown to 
possess a substantial degree of myocardial depressant activ- 
ity in this in vitro cardiac myocyte assay, tmmunoabsorp- 
tion of either TNF-ot or IL-113 from this serum resulted in 
relatively little attenuation of myocardial depressant activity 
in comparison to preimmune, antibody-treated septic se- 
rum (septic control). However, immunoabsorption of both 
TNF-ct and IL-113 from the serum resulted in virtual elim- 
ination of depressant activity. This result was seen in each 
of the five individual patient sera tested and was statistically 
highly significant. 
Synergism between TNF-~x and IL-113 in the context of 
this study implies that complete elimination of either 
should result in loss of serum myocardial depressant activ- 
ity. There are at least two possible reasons for the limited 
attenuation of serum myocardial depressant activity seen in 
this study when only TNF-oe or IL-113 was immunoab- 
sorbed. As we have shown, immunoabsorption is not en- 
tirely effective in cytokine removal. The small amounts of 
TNF-cx or IL-113 that remain may be sufficient to sustain 
synergy. However, when both cytokines are targetted, total 
TNF-oe and IL-113 may drop below the threshold required 
for expression of synergistic activity. Alternately, the gener- 
ation of septic serum-induced cardiac myocyte dysfunction 
may be more complex than a limited interaction between 
TNF-ot and IL-1[~. Although other cytokines have no de- 
monstrable depressant activity of their own, they may pro- 
duce a synergistic effect so that removal of only TNF-cl or 
IL-t13 is inadequate to eliminate serum depressant activity. 
Further support for the synergistic role of TNF-oe and 
IL-113 in septic myocardial depression comes from our ex- 
periments which show that, in combination, TNF-oe and 
IL-113 cause cardiac myocyte depression at concentrations 
that are incompatible with merely additive depressant ac-

tivity. Since concentrations of 0.003-0.0125 ng/ml TNF-a 
and 0.125-0.5 ng/ml IL-113 together produce depression of 
maximum extent and peak velocity of cardiac myocyte 
shortening, whereas 64-256-fold higher concentrations are 
required to produce depression individually, synergism of 
their depressant activity appears likely. Of note is the fact 
that these concentrations of TNF-o~ and IL-I~ are two to 
three orders of magnitude smaller than those previously 
documented to cause depression of myocardial tissue and 
fall well within the range commonly seen in patients with 
severe sepsis and septic shock (11, 13-17). 
A number of studies have inferred a potential role for 
TNF-oc and IL-113 in inflammatory myocardial depression 
by demonstrating that cytokine-containing supematants of 
activated macrophages exhibit myocardial depressant activ- 
ity (decreased myocardial sensitivity to catecholamines; 18, 
19). However, cytokine concentrations in such superna- 
tants are typically extremely high compared to levels circu- 
lating during sepsis. These studies have not demonstrated 
any form of a synergistic action between cytokines in the 
generation of myocardial depressant activity. 
Several previous studies have shown that a combination 
of the two cytokines, TNF-a and IL-I~, exerts synergistic 
hemodynamic effects in a number of in vivo models of sep- 
sis and septic shock (20-22). Weinberg et al. (20) have 
shown that doses of LPS, TNF-oc, and IL-113 too low to 
cause a hemodynamic disturbance individually can act syn- 
ergistically to produce hypotension in unanesthetized rab- 
bits. Okusawa et al. (21) have shown that low doses ofIL-1 [3 
in combination with TNF-0t produced a shocklike state in 
rabbits. Waage and Espevik (22) demonstrated that [L-I~ 
synergistically potentiated the lethal effect of TNF-o~ ad- 
ministered to mice. 
Whereas TNF-~x and IL-113, in combination, cause in vitro 
cardiac myocyte depression at concentrations well within 
the serum range documented in human septic shock, indi- 
vidually each can also cause cardiac myocyte depression. 
TNF-a begins to cause significant concentration-depen- 
dent depression of cardiac myocyte contraction (both max- 
imum extent and peak velocity of shortening) beginning at 
concentrations within the range documented during septic 
shock (0.2-0.8 ng/ml). This concentration, though, is clearly 
infrequently documented during clinical septic shock. Sim- 
ilarly, cardiac myocyte depression induced by lL-l[3 begins 
at concentrations 4-10 times higher (8-32 ng/ml) than those 
typically documented during human septic shock. Again, only 
rare patients reach such serum levels during clinical septic 
shock. 
Myocardial depression in septic shock has been well char- 
acterized in both spontaneous human septic shock and in 
experimental animal models of septic shock (1-3, 23, 24). 
Available evidence suggests that myocardial dysfunction in 
955 
Kumar et al. 
septic shock is mediated by a circulating myocardial depres- 
sant substance or substances (4, 6, 7, 9, 25). Early studies of 
a myocardial depressant factor associated with endotoxic 
and septic shock (26, 27) focused on a small (<1 kD) pep- 
tide of pancreatic origin. Later studies by other groups im- 
phcated at least two distinct factors of unknown chemical 
composition with differing molecular masses (<1 kD and 
1-10 kD; 28) or a heat-stable, lipid-soluble estrogenic 
compound of <1 kD (29, 30). None of these substances 
was definitively identified or isolated. 
The most recent studies attempting to characterize the 
circulating myocardial depressant substances in human sep- 
tic shock (4) and canine endotoxic shock (9) have imph- 
cated a heat-labile, proteinase-sensitive molecule or mole- 
cules ranging from 10 to 30 kD. Such physical properties 
exclude prostaglandins and leukotrienes but are compatible 
with most known cytokines. 
The human recombinant cytokines used in this study are 
those that have been suggested to play a potential role in 
sepsis and septic shock in animals or humans. Each, to a 
varying extent, possesses biologic activity in rat tissues. At 
one extreme, TNF-et, IL-I~, and IL-6 are generally ac- 
knowledged to exert a broad range of biologic effects with 
substantial cross-species activity. At the other, IFN-~/ and 
IL-4 exert a narrow range of activity and are, with occa- 
sional exceptions, highly species specific. Other cytokines 
utilized in this study have intermediate ranges ofbioactivity 
and cross-species specificity. Of the cytokines studied, 
TNF-tx, IL-I~, IL-2, and IL-6 have previously been sug- 
gested to cause depression of contractility in some studies 
of in vitro myocardial tissue (16, 31, 32). 
In contrast to our findings that support a rapid (<10 
rain) onset of cardiac myocyte depression by TNF-et, IL-113, 
and human septic serum, a number of recent studies have 
implicated a later onset, cytokine-mediated [3-adrenergic 
signal transduction defect (18, 33) and/or stimulation of an 
inducible nitric oxide synthetase (19, 34-36) in septic and 
inflammatory myocardial depression. Depression of myo- 
cardial tissue contractility in these studies is delayed (hours 
to days) relative to the early depressant activity in our 
model. Similarly, evidence of relatively delayed (days) de- 
pression of myocardial contractility in animal models of 
septic shock (23, 37) is parallelled by data that show that in- 
fusion ofendotoxin or TNF can result in early (<1 h) de- 
pression of cardiac function (38-40). Therefore, it seems 
hkely that different processes may be responsible for early 
(14, 16) and late (34-36) cytokine-induced septic myocar- 
dial dysfunction. Such a dual or biphasic, cytokine-driven 
mechanism of inflammatory cardiac dysfunction is consis- 
tent with our observations that the degree of septic serum- 
induced cardiac myocyte depression (occurring within rain 
of exposure) significantly correlates with the amount of 
clinical myocardial depression as measured by decrease in 
ejection fraction (which typically occurs 2-3 d after the on- 
set of sepsis; 2, 6). 
The specific intracellular mechanisms by which cyto- 
kines cause depression of cardiac myocyte contractility in 
this model have not been addressed in this study. However, 
a number of inferences can be made. First, the effect does 
not appear to be related to direct cytotoxicity since, in the 
present study, lactate dehydrogenase levels are not in- 
creased, supravital staining is not decreased, and most im- 
portandy, the cardiac myocyte depressant effect induced by 
TNF-et and IL-1[3 is reversed within minutes after removal 
of cytokines. Second, since depression was also produced 
by apphcation of TNF-tx or IL-I~ to >95-98% purified 
myocyte cultures, it is unlikely that cytokine-induced pro- 
duction of secondary mediators from cardiac nonmyocytes 
(such as fibroblasts, endothehal cells, or dendritic cells) plays 
a significant role. Third, since depression occurs and re- 
verses within 5-10 min of introduction or removal ofcyto- 
kine or septic serum, de novo protein synthesis cannot be 
involved. 
A significant amount of endotoxin is present in most of 
the test solutions used in this study. Endotoxin has been 
suggested by one group to have a potential role in suppres- 
sion of the beating rate of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes via 
coinduction (with IL-1[3) of an inducible nitric oxide syn- 
thetase (41). Others have suggested that a similar inducible 
nitric oxide synthetase dependent mechanism may also ex- 
plain delayed onset depression of myocardial tissue exposed 
to IL-1[3 or activated macrophage products (19, 34-36). 
Such a mechanism, whether endotoxin or cytokine driven, 
is unlikely to be relevant in these observations since the 
time frame of the depressant response (<10 rain after the 
introduction of cytokines) is far too rapid to be explained 
by any form of de novo protein synthesis. However, the 
same authors have correctly pointed out that evidence is 
accumulating that nitric oxide has been shown to be pro- 
duced by endotoxin-sfimulated constitutive nitric oxide syn- 
thetase in endothelial cells (42). They have raised the possi- 
bility that endotoxin contamination, rather than cytokine 
effects, may account for myocardial tissue depression in 
some studies (16). Although endotoxin is clearly present in 
this model, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of depression 
since control samples (which contain identical amounts of 
endotoxin) would then also be expected to express similar 
depressant activity. In addition, we have demonstrated that 
endotoxin concentrations as high as 1 p,g/ml in this assay 
fail to produce depression of cardiac myocyte contractility 
(43). Finally, the possibility that endotoxin contributes sig- 
nificandy to TNF-et, IL-113, or human septic serum-induced 
cardiac myocyte depression is strongly refuted by the dem- 
onstration that test solutions depleted of endotoxin con- 
tinue to exhibit significant myocardial depressant activity. 
There exist two hmitations to this model. First, the neo- 
natal rat cardiac myocytes utilized have the disadvantage of 
not being terminally differentiated as are adult myocytes. 
Their characteristics change as they age. They exhibit met- 
abolic differences from adult cells including significant dif- 
ferences in membrane receptors (44). It can be argued that 
phenomena observed in neonatal rat myocytes may have 
limited relevance to human adult cardiac pathophysiology. 
However, we have already shown a significant relationship 
between septic serum-induced in vitro cardiac depression 
in this model and in vivo cardiac depression (decreased 
956 
TNF and IL-1 Cause Septic Serum-induced Myocardial Cell Depression 
ejection fraction) in the septic shock patients from whom 
the serum is obtained (4, 6). This argues in favor of the po- 
tential clinical relevance of this phenomenon. The use of 
serum-based media, although a necessary component of this 
study, also introduces additional variables. Apart from the 
cytokines of interest, serum contains a variety of poorly un- 
derstood, unidentified factors that can affect myocyte me- 
tabolism. However, the use of controls using the same se- 
rum for comparison purposes compensates for this variable. 
The results of this study strongly suggest that a synergistic 
interaction of TNF-cx and IL-113 may be at least partially 
responsible for septic myocardial depression in vivo. Each 
cytokine is individually capable of myocardial depressant 
activity at concentrations somewhat higher than those typi- 
cally found during human septic shock. In combination, 
however, concentrations of TNF-a and IL-1~3 well within 
the range documented during clinical septic shock appear 
sufficient to cause myocyte depression, whereas elimination 
of TNF-c~ and IL-1[3 from human septic serum abrogates 
its depressant activity. These observations suggest that the 
search for a single myocardial depressant substance in sepsis 
and shock may be fruitless because myocardial depression 
in such conditions may be the result of interaction of more 
than one factor.

Summary
Retinoids and vitamin D are important factors that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. An
additive growth-inhibitory effect of retinoids and vitamin D analogues has been demonstrated for human
myeloma, leukaemic and breast cancer cells. We set out to study the effects of the vitamin D analogue EB1089
and the retinoids all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid on the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines Capan
1
and Capan 2 and the undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma cell line Hs766T. The cell lines investigated
expressed vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-a and y as determined by polymerase chain
reaction after reverse transcription. RAR-f, was expressed only in Hs766T cells. Addition of all-trans-retinoic
acid increased the amount of RAR-a mRNA in the three cell lines and induced RAR-,B mRNA in Capan
1 and
Capan 2 cells. All-trans-retinoic acid at a concentration of 10 nM inhibited the growth of Capan
1 and Capan 2
cells by 40% relative to controls. 9-cis-Retinoic acid was less effective. Neither all-trans-retinoic acid nor 9-cis-
retinoic acid affected the growth of Hs766T cells. EB1089, if added alone to the cells, did not significantly
inhibit growth. However, the combination of 1 nM EB1089 with 10 nM all-trans-retinoic acid exerted a growth-
inhibitory effect of 90% in Capan
1 cells and of 70% in Capan 2 cells. Our data suggest that vitamin D
analogues together with retinoids inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells. However, in vivo studies
are necessary to examine the potential use of retinoids and vitamin D analogues on pancreatic cancer.

Carcinoma of the pancreas is the fifth leading cause of death
from malignant disease in Western society. In the United
States incidence of pancreatic carcinoma has trebled in the
last
50
years
(Kelly
and
Benjamin,
1995).
Pancreatic
carcinoma
is associated with an especially poor prognosis
(Jeekel,
1994).
Neither
radiotherapy
nor
chemotherapy
improve
5
year survival
rates, which do not exceed 5%
(Wagener et al., 1994>. Therefore new therapeutic modalities
are essential for treating pancreatic carcinoma. There has
been increasing evidence that the steroid hormones retinoic
acid and vitamin D are naturally occurring agents controlling
cellular differentiation and proliferation both in normal and
malignant cells (Colston, 1993).
The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy-
vitamin D3 [calcitriol-1,25(OH) D3] exerts effects unrelated to
calcium homeostasis such as inhibiting proliferation of cancer
cells (Cross et al., 1992). Receptors for vitamin D are present
in a variety of cancer cells, including pancreatic adenocarci-
noma (Reichel et al., 1989). However, a major drawback to
considering conventional vitamin D metabolites as therapeu-
tic agents is the production of hypercalcaemia at doses more
than

Recently a number of laboratories have developed synthetic
vitamin D analogues that inhibit cancer cell growth, but have
reduced calcaemic activity (Colston et al., 1992; Shabahang et
al., 1994). One compound, EB 1089, which is characterised
by a modified C17 side chain of the vitamin D molecule,
inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
(Colston et al., 1992).
Retinoids are natural and synthetic derivatives to vitamin
A (Bollag and Holdener, 1992). They elicit a large array of
biological responses during morphogenesis and differentiation
(Sporn and Roberts, 1983). Knowledge of the effects of these
compounds has led to the assumption that retinoids may act
as chemopreventive agents as well as inhibitors of tumour
growth (Bollag and Holdener,
1992). Retinoids have been
shown to depress tumour incidence and size in animal models
(Gudas, 1992). Studies with cancer cells demonstrate growth
inhibition induced by retinoids (Eliason et al., 1993; Peehl et
al., 1994).
Combining retinoids with cytokines such
as interferon
leads to enhanced effects on tumours in vitro and in vivo
(Bollag and Peck, 1994). Additionally, recent investigations
have shown that retinoids together with vitamin D analogues
induce
additive

of
myeloma
cells,
leukaemic cells and breast cancer cells (Dore et al., 1993;
Lutzky et al., 1994; Bollag and Peck, 1994).
We set out to study the effects of the retinoids all-trans-
retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid and the vitamin D analogue
EB1089
on
three human pancreatic
cell
lines,
two
were
derived from adenocarcinomas and one was derived from an
undifferentiated carcinoma.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
NRK fibroblasts and the human pancreatic cancer cell lines
Capan
1, Capan 2 and Hs766T
were received from the
American Tissue Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD, USA).
Cell
lines were cultivated
in RPMI medium
(Gibco, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, UK) and routinely tested for
mycoplasma contamination.
Retinoids and vitamin D
All-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid were a generous gift
from Hoffman La Roche (Basle, Switzerland). The vitamin D
analogue EB1089 was a generous gift from Leo pharmaceu-
tical (Copenhagen, Denmark).

at 37°C. L-Glutamine was added every 2 days. After 2, 4, 7
and 9 days cells were detached with trypsin EDTA (Gibco,
BRL) and their number was estimated using a Coulter cell
counter (Coulter). Viability had been determined by trypan
blue exclusion before cells were counted.

Incubation was performed at 52°C for 30 min, at 99°C for
1 min and at 4°C for 5 min.
Seminested PCR was performed essentially as described by
Harant
et
al.
(1993).
In brief the
first amplification
was
performed in a 20 jl reaction mix that was composed of 2 pl
cDNA (equivalent
to
500 ng of RNA),
2.5 ,ul of dNTP
(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) (5 nmol of each dATP, dCTP,
dGTP and dTTP), 2.5 !l each of 5' and 3' sequence primers
(10 pmol Iul-
each) and 5 pl of 10 x
buffer (100 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM potassium chloride, 15 mm magnesium
chloride, 0.1% gelatin) and brought with water to a final
volume of 20 ,ul. PCR was performed in a minicycler (MJ
Research) for 35 cycles. The incubation times per cycle were
40 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 1 min at 72°C with an extra
5 min for the last cycle. The following primers were used:
RAR-f, sense: 5'-AGGAGACTTCGAAGCAAG (bp 822- 839)

Expression of the f32-microglobulin mRNA was used as an
internal control of the PCR reaction and reverse transcrip-
tion: in contrast to the RAR-PCRs (see above) samples were
taken after only 20 cycles, which is well before the time at
which the PCR reaction reaches its plateau (data not shown).
No signal without reverse transcription was obtained. The
following primers were used:
Sense:
5'
- CAGCAAGGACTGGTCTTTCTATCTCTTGTA,
corresponding to bases 201 - 230 of the cDNA (Suggs et

- GGAGCAACCTGCTCAGATACATCAAAA
CATGG,
corresponding to bases 539-510 of the cDNA.
Statistical analysis
For each data point mean and standard deviation were
calculated. Student's t-test was performed and a P-value of
<0.01 was considered statistically different.
Results
Anchorage-dependent growth assays
We studied the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic
acid and the vitamin D analogue EB1089 on the anchorage-
independent growth of the human pancreatic adenocarcino-
ma cell lines Capan
1, Capan 2 and the undifferentiated
human pancreatic carcinoma cell line Hs766T. Cells were
incubated
with
concentrations
of
retinoids
and
EB1089
ranging from
1 pM to
1 ,UM. After 7 days of incubation cell
number was quantified and compared with that in medium
without added hormone. The anti-proliferative effects of all-
trans-retinoic
acid
and
9-cis-retinoic
acid
were
dose
dependent (Figures
1 and
2). All-trans-retinioc acid
at a
concentration of 10 nM inhibited the growth of the pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell lines Capan
1 and Capan 2 by 40%
relative to untreated controls (Figure 1). 9-cis-retinoic acid at
the same concentration
affected
the growth by 25%
as
compared with untreated controls (Figure 2). The growth of
the undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma cell line Hs766T
was not affected by all-trans- or 9-cis-retinoic acid (data not
shown). The vitamin D analogue EB 1089 had a maximal
growth inhibitory effect of 25%, which was reached at a
concentration of 1 nM in all three cell lines (Figure 3, shown
for Capan
1 cells). Increasing concentrations of EB1089 did
not
enhance
this
effect
(Figure
3),
however,
EB1089
potentiated the effects of all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid
(Figure 4). In the presence of 1 nM EB1089 all-trans-retinoic
acid, at a concentration of 10 nM, induced an inhibition of
90% of growth in Capan 1 cells and an inhibition of 70% of
growth
in Capan
2
cells
(Figure
4).
9-cis-Retinoic
acid
(10 nM) in the presence of 1 nM EB1089 was not as effective
as all-trans-retinoic acid (Figure. 4). Vitamin D3 had the same
effects on growth as EB1089 (data not shown). All-trans-
retinoic acid up to a concentration of 1000 nM did not reduce

Expression of receptor mRNA
Total RNA was extracted from the three human pancreatic

For RAR-a a specific amplification product could be easily
detected corresponding in size to the product described by

weak signal of RAR-f3 and RAR-y (data not shown), we
applied a seminested PCR as second amplification step for
detection of the mRNA of these two receptors. Using this
approach the three cell lines showed a strong signal of RAR-
y mRNA (Figure 6) corresponding to the specific product
described earlier in ovarian cancer cells (Harant et al., 1993).
In
contrast, we found
differential
expression
of RAR-fl
mRNA, which could be detected only
in Hs766T
cells,
matching the product described previously (Harant et al.,
1993) but neither in Capan 1 nor in Capan 2 cells (Figure 6).
Addition of 10 nM
all-trans-retinoic acid induced RAR-fl
expression in Capan
1 (Figure 7) and Capan 2 cells (not
shown) but did not affect RAR-fl expression in Hs766T cells
(Figure 7). Expression of,2-microglobulin mRNA measured
after only 20 cycles of amplification was used as an internal
control that showed a similar intensity in all samples tested,
suggesting quantitative comparable PCR reactions (Figure 7).
For expression of vitamin D receptor mRNA a signal was
obtained in all cell lines using PCR after reverse transcription
(Figure
8), which was the size expected from the cDNA
sequence published earlier (Evans, 1988).

members of the steroid super family may also become tools
for treating solid tumours (Reichel et al., 1989; Cross et al.,
1992; Bollag and Holdener, 1992; Gudas, 1992). In this paper
we report that synthetic retinoids together with the vitamin D
analogue EB1089 inhibit the growth of two cell lines derived
from human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. AII-trans-retinoic
acid has turned out to be a more potent growth inhibitor
than 9-cis-retinoic acid. The growth of one cell line derived
from an undifferentiated human pancreatic carcinoma was
not affected.
A number of studies have demonstrated growth-inhibitory
effects of retinoids and vitamin D in cancer. Eliason et al.
(1993) have shown anti-proliferative effects of the arotinoid
Ro 40-8757 on human breast, colon and cervical cancer cell
lines. Maximal effects are reached at a concentration of 1-
3 pM. Synthetic retinoids have therapeutic effects on breast
cancer (Teelman et al., 1993), ovarian cancer (Formelli and
Cleris,
1993) and prostate cancer (Pienta et al.,
1993) in
animal models. However retinoids do not exert any effect on
growth of adenocarcinoma cells of the lung (Eliason et al.,
1993; Geradts et al., 1993). Retinoic acid receptors have been
demonstrated
in ovarian cancer cell
lines (Harant
et
al.,
1993), breast cancer cell lines (Roman et al., 1992), myeloma
cells and leukaemic cells (Lutzky et al., 1994; Dore et al.,
1993). There is no correlation between biological effects of
retinoids and degree of receptor expression (van-der Leede et
al., 1993; Lutzky et al., 1994), which is consistent with our
results. A lack of retinoic acid receptor subgroups such as
RAR-1
has been described in malignant tumours (Gudas,
1992; Xu et al., 1994; Swisshelm et al., 1994).
Lotan et al. (1995) have demonstrated in premalignant
oral lesions that the loss of expression of RAR-f
can be
restored by treatment with isoretinoin. We have obtained
similar
results.

Vitamin D has been shown to inhibit growth of human
colon carcinoma cells (Shabahang et al., 1993) and to induce
regression of T-cell lymphoma of the skin (Scott-Mackie et
al., 1993). Receptors for vitamin D are present in a variety of
cancer cell lines, including prostate carcinoma (Miller et al..
1992),
pancreatic
carcinoma,
osteosarcoma,
melanoma,
breast
carcinoma,
colon
carcinoma,
thyroid
carcinoma,
bladder carcinoma,
cervical carcinoma and
fibrosarcoma
(Reichel et al., 1989). Recently a new vitamin D analogue,
EB 1089, has been developed (Colston et al., 1992). EB 1089
is a potent inhibitor of proliferation of breast cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo (Colston et al.,
1992). Other vitamin D
analogues have been developed that significantly inhibit the
growth of human colon cancer cells in vitro (Cross et al.,
1992; Shabahang et al., 1994). These analogues reduce the
growth rate twice as effectively as does dihydroxyvitamin D3
(Shabahang et al.,
1994). Although we have demonstrated
expression of vitamin D receptor (Figure 8), the analogue EB
1089 (Figure 3) as well as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 do not
significantly
inhibit
the
growth
of
human
pancreatic
carcinoma cells.
Combinations of retinoids with various compounds lead to
enhanced anti-tumour activities (Bollag and Peck, 1994). In
clinical trials retinoids have been mostly used together with
interferon. The best results have been achieved in squamous
cell carcinomas of the skin and the cervix (Bollag and Peck,
1994). Studies in vitro have shown additive growth-inhibitory
effects of vitamin D analogues and retinoids
in myeloid
leukaemic cell lines (Dore et al., 1993), myeloma cell lines
(Lutzky
et
al.,
1994) and the oestrogen receptor-positive
human breast cancer cell line T47D (Bollag and Peck, 1994).
Additional in vitro investigations and tests in animal models
will be needed to clarify the potential role of vitamin D
analogues and retinoids in the therapy of pancreatic cancer.

Summary
The c-erbB-2 product is thought to be a unique and useful target for antibody therapy of cancers
overexpressing the c-erbB-2 gene. In vitro and in vivo anti-tumour effects of a humanised antibody against the
extracellular domain of the c-erbB-2 gene product, rhu4D5, were examined. Rhu4D5 was less effective than its
murine counterpart, mu4D5, for the direct antiproliferative activity against the c-erbB-2-overexpressing SK-
BR-3 cell line. In vivo treatment of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice carrying the c-erbB-2-
overexpressing 4-1ST human gastric carcinoma xenograft with rhu4D5 revealed that the recombinant protein
had potent anti-tumour activity. Furthermore, cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
against 4-1ST was significantly augmented with rhu4D5, but not with mu4D5. These results indicate that
rhu4D5 might perform better in patients than predicted from preclinical studies.
Keywords: c-erbB-2; humanised monoclonal antibody; anti-tumour effect; severe combined immunodeficient
mice
The c-erbB-2/HER-2 proto-oncogene encodes a receptor-type
tyrosine kinase (Yarden and Ullrich, 1988) related to, but
distinct from, the epidermal growth factor receptor (Coussens
et al., 1985; Yamamoto et al., 1986). The cell surface protein
consists of extracellular, transmembrane and
intracellular
domains,
the
latter possessing kinase
activity capable of
autophosphorylation. Appreciable amplification and/or over-
expression of this gene has been demonstrated in a variety of
adenocarcinomas including breast, ovarian, lung and gastric
cancers (King et al., 1985; Yokota et al., 1986; Van de Vijver
et al., 1987; Slamon et al., 1989; Kern et al., 1990). However,
the expression of this gene in normal adult tissues is weak
(De Potter et al., 1989; Press et al., 1990). Therefore, the c-
erbB-2 product is thought to be a useful target for antibody
therapy of cancers overexpressing the c-erbB-2 gene.
Several series of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)
directed against the extracellular domain of the c-erbB-2 gene
product have already been reported to have in vitro and in
vivo anti-tumour effects (Drebin et al., 1985; Hudziak et al.,
1989; Hancock et al., 1991; Tagliabue et al., 1991; Stancovski
et al., 1991; Harwerth et al., 1992; Kasprzyk et al., 1992).
However,
human
anti-mouse
antibody
response
during
therapy
would
be
a
major
limitation
in
the
clinical
application
of such murine MAbs
(Schroff et
al.,
1985;
Shawler et al., 1985). Therefore, Carter and his colleagues
constructed
a
'humanised'
antibody
containing
only
the
antigen-binding
loops
from
a murine MAb
against
the
extracellular
domain
of the
c-erbB-2
gene
product
and
human
variable
region
framework
residues
plus
IgG,
constant domains (Carter et al., 1992).
In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-
tumour effects of the humanised antibody in comparison with
its murine counterpart.
Materials and methods
Cell lines and xenotransplanted tumour lines
Human tumour cell lines, SK-BR-3, BT474, MDA-MB-453,
MCF7, ZR-75-1, KATO III and IMR-32 were obtained from

the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA).
Human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN45 and MKN7 were
obtained from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Yokohama
Research Center (Yokohama, Japan). All cell lines except
MKN7 were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Flow Laboratory,
McLean, VA, USA). MKN7 was maintained in Ham's F-12
medium plus Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (1: 1, v/v).
Human gastric carcinoma xenografts, 4-1ST and St-15, were
maintained by serial inoculation in Balb/cA nude mice.
Antibodies
A murine MAb, mu4D5, recognising the extracellular domain
of the c-erbB-2 product was generated by Fendly et al. (1990)
and
supplied
by
Mitsubishi
Chemical
Corporation.
A
humanised MAb, rhu4D5, was constructed from mu4D5 by
molecular engineering (Carter et
al.,
1992) and was also
provided by
Mitsubishi
Chemical
Corporation. A
class-
matched murine MAb that recognised the surface antigen
of hepatitis B virus, HBs, and an IgG,
subclass human
immunoglobulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as
control antibodies.
Animals
Balb/cA-nu mice were obtained from Clea Japan (Tokyo,
Japan). CB-17-scid mice were gifts from Dr Bosma (Fox Case
Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and bred in our
animal
quarters.
They
were
maintained
under
specific
pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the animal care
guidelines of the Central Institute for Experimental Animals.
The mice were used at 6 -8 weeks of age.
FACS analysis of c-erbB-2 protein expression
Cells were suspended in 1% (v/v) FBS in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The
cells
(1 x 106 ml-1) were incubated for
60 min on ice with 1 ,ug of either 4D5 or control antibodies.
The cells were then washed twice, resuspended in 0.1 ml of
1%
FBS/PBS
and
incubated
with
12.5 ,ug
of
FITC-
conjugated F (ab')2 fragments of goat anti-mouse or anti-
human IgG (Orgaton Teknica-Cappel, Malvern, PA, USA)
for 45 min on ice. After being washed twice with 1% FBS/
PBS, the cells were resuspended in
1 ml of assay buffer and
analysed using a FACScan cell sorter (Becton Dickinson,
Mountain View, CA, USA).
Proliferation assays
To examine in vitro effects of the MAbs on proliferation of
the human tumour cell lines, MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium
bromide]
assay was
used
as
previously described by Mosmann (1983). Briefly, the cells
were cultured for 3 days with various concentrations of the
anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies, mu4D5 and rhu4D5, in 96-well flat-
bottom microplates. MTT (Sigma) solution (final concentra-
tion, 0.5 mg ml-') was added to the wells and the plates were
incubated at 37°C for 5 h. Then, acid-isopropanol was added
to the wells. The plates of triplicate samples were read on a
microelisa reader (SLT Labinstruments, Salzburg, Austria)
using a wavelength of 570 nm to determine
relative
cell
proliferation (per cent of control).
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
from normal donors and spleen cells of Balb/cA-nu mice
were serially diluted into 96-well round-bottom microplates
with various dilutions of the antibodies and 2500 per well of
target tumour cells. The cytotoxicity was determined by a
4 h
51Cr-release
assay.
Each
assay
was
performed
in
triplicate. Per cent cytotoxicity was calculated as described
previously
(Tokuda
et
al.,
1989).
Some
results
were
expressed as lytic units per
106 cells, with one lytic unit
being the number of effector cells required to cause 30%
lysis of target cells. The exponential
fit equation and per
cent lysis with four effector/target cell ratios within each
experiment were used to obtain the target cell survival curve
and to calculate the lytic units.
In some experiments, solid tumours in nude mice were
resected, finely dispersed using scissors, incubated in Hanks'
balanced salt solution containing 0.05% pronase (Boehringer
Mannheim, Germany), 0.02% collagenase type I (Sigma) and
0.02% DNAase
I (Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min, and then
passed
through
a
nylon
mesh
to
prepare
single-cell
suspensions to be used as a target for ADCC assays.
In vivo anti-tumour assay
Effects on the tumours in the exponential growth phase were
examined by a previously described method (Inaba et al.,
1988), in which nude mice were used instead of SCID mice.

In brief, a tumour fragment was subcutaneously inoculated
into the right flank of SCID mice. Tumour size was measured
twice
a
week
with
calipers,
and
tumour
volume
was
calculated
according
to
the
formula;
tumour
volume
(mm3) = length x (width)2x 1/2. Mice were randomly divided
into experimental groups when each tumour had reached a
palpable size (100- 300 mm3), and antibodies were injected
intravenously. Per cent tumour volume ratio of treated mice
to control mice (%T/C) was calculated for statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis
Wilcoxon's signed rank test and Spearman's rank correlation
test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical
analysis.
Results
The binding of rhu4D5 to the c-erbB-2 protein was first
examined by flow cytometry and compared with that of
mu4D5. Figure
1 summarises all the FACS data obtained
from
cell lines with rhu4D5 and mu4D5. No significant
difference
was
observed
between
rhu4D5
and
mu4D5
(Wilcoxon's signed rank test). IMR-32, which is a human
glioma
cell
line
with
negative
c-erbB-2
expression,
was
negative for both rhu4D5 and mu4D5.
The antiproliferative activity of the two antibodies was
tested on a c-erbB-2-overexpressing human breast carcinoma
cell line, SK-BR-3, by MTT assay. At concentrations ranging
between 0.2 and 100 jug ml-' mu4D5 inhibited the growth of
SK-BR-3 slightly more strongly than rhu4D5 (Figure 2).
ADCC against SK-BR-3 of human PBMC with rhu4D5
and
of murine
splenocytes
with mu4D5
was
increased
dependent on the dose of both antibodies reaching a plateau
at more than 0.1 jIg ml-
(data not shown). Thus,
1 Mg ml-1
of the antibodies was used in subsequent experiments.
Cytotoxicity of human PBMC against a variety of c-erbB-2-
positive human tumour cell lines was significantly augmented in
the presence of rhu4D5 (Figure 3), but the extent of killing was
not correlated with the level of the c-erbB-2 expression (see
Figure 1) (correlation coefficient=0.25, P=0.066 by Spear-
man's test). Cytotoxicity against c-erbB-2-negative IMR-32
was not changed in the presence or absence of the antibody.
The anti-tumour effects of rhu4D5 were examined in vivo
in SCID mice transplanted with human gastric cancer 4-1ST
and St-15. As reported previously (Ohnishi et al., 1995), the
4-1ST tumour was found to express large amounts of the c-
erbB-2 protein at a similar level to SK-BR-3 by immunoblot-

ting and Northern analyses, whereas the St- 15 tumour was
found to express the c-erbB-2 protein at an undetectable
level.
SCID mice bearing 4-1ST or St-15 tumours were treated
with a single intravenous administration of 36 mg kg-' of
rhu4D5 or human IgG, when the tumour volume reached
100-300 mm3. Even 4 days after treatment, %T/C of 4-1ST
was significantly reduced to 50%. However, %T/C of St-15
was more than 100%. The difference in %T/C between 4-1ST
and
St-15 was
significant by
the Mann -Whitney
U-test
(Figure 4). On the other hand, mu4D5 was more potent in
inhibiting the growth of the 4-1ST xenograft (Figure 5).
To examine a role of ADCC in SCID mice treated with
rhu4D5 and mu4D5, 4-1ST tumour cells were cultured for a
short period and used as targets for ADCC assays. As shown
in Figure
6, cytotoxicity of murine
splenocytes was not
augmented
with mu4D5, whereas
cytotoxicity
of human
PBMC was strongly augmented by rhu4D5.
Discussion
The c-erbB-2 product is thought to be a unique and useful
target for antibody therapy of cancers overexpressing the c-
erbB-2 gene. Several series of murine MAbs directed against
the extracellular domain of the c-erbB-2 gene product have
been developed and examined to reveal their anti-tumour
effects, mainly in vitro. However, human anti-mouse antibody
response during therapy would be a major limitation on the
clinical
application
of such murine MAbs.
Therefore,

humanised antibody against the c-erbB-2 gene product
is
expected to be useful in clinical trials if its anti-tumour effects
in
vitro and
in
vivo
are
similar
to
those
of its murine
counterpart.
As Carter and his colleagues designed rhu4D5 to bind its
antigen
3-fold more
tightly
than mu4D5
by
molecular
modelling (Carter et al., 1992), our flow cytometry analyses
revealed that the binding of rhu4D5 to the surface molecule
of the c-erbB-2 product was comparable with that of mu4D5.
In vitro anti-proliferative activity of rhu4D5 against SK-BR-3
was also comparable with that of mu4D5 in the MTT assay
as mentioned by Carter. Rhu4D5 was less potent in inhibiting
the growth of 4-1ST xenografts in SCID mice. However,
ADCC assays with rhu4D5 showed cytotoxicity against a
variety of human tumour cell lines overexpressing the c-erbB-
2 product. The extent of killing was not correlated with the
level of the c-erbB-2
expression.
This was however
not
surprising since susceptibility of the tumour cells to other
cytotoxic functions such as spontaneous cytotoxicity was
variable. Cytotoxicity of human PBMC against 4-1ST was
significantly augmented with rhu4D5, but not with mu4D5.
Thus, rhu4D5 may be predicted to have greater anti-tumour
potency in clinical trials than mu4D5.
There have been no published reports on
in
vivo anti-
tumour effects of humanised antibodies against the c-erbB-2
products, although rhu4D5 is currently undergoing evalua-
tion in the treatment of patients with breast cancer (Baselga
et al., 1995). Our preclinical study of rhu4D5 using SCID

Infectious Diseases

“Emerging” infectious diseases can be defined as infections that have newly
appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or
geographic range. Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, Lyme disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (a foodborne infection
caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli). Specific factors precipitating disease
emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. These include ecological, environ-
mental, or demographic factors that place people at increased contact with a pre-
viously unfamiliar microbe or its natural host or promote dissemination. These
factors are increasing in prevalence; this increase, together with the ongoing evolution
of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that
infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasizes the urgent
need for effective surveillance and control. Dr. David Satcher’s article and this
overview inaugurate “Perspectives,” a regular section in this journal intended to
present and develop unifying concepts and strategies for considering emerging
infections and their underlying factors. The editors welcome, as contributions to the
Perspectives section, overviews, syntheses, and case studies that shed light on how
and why infections emerge, and how they may be anticipated and prevented.
Infectious diseases emerging throughout history
have included some of the most feared plagues of the
past. New infections continue to emerge today, while
many of the old plagues are with us still. These are
global problems (William Foege, former CDC direc-
tor now at the Carter Center, terms them “global
infectious disease threats”). As demonstrated by in-
fluenza epidemics, under suitable circumstances, a
new infection first appearing anywhere in the world
could traverse entire continents within days or
weeks.
We can define as “emerging” infections that have
newly appeared in the population, or have existed
but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic
range (1,2). Recent examples of emerging diseases
in various parts of the world include HIV/AIDS;
classic cholera in South America and Africa; cholera
due to Vibrio cholerae O139; Rift Valley fever; han-
tavirus pulmonary syndrome; Lyme disease; and
hemolytic uremic syndrome, a foodborne infection
caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli (in the
United States, serotype O157:H7).
Although these occurrences may appear inexpli-
cable, rarely if ever do emerging infections appear
without reason. Specific factors responsible for dis-
ease emergence can be identified in virtually all
cases studied (2-4). Table 1 summarizes the known
causes for a number of infections that have emerged
recently. I have suggested that infectious disease
emergence can be viewed operationally as a two-step
process: 1) Introduction of the agent into a new host
population (whether the pathogen originated in the
environment, possibly in another species, or as a
variant of an existing human infection), followed by
2) establishment and further dissemination within
the new host population (“adoption”) (4). Whatever
its origin, the infection “emerges” when it reaches a
new population. Factors that promote one or both of
these steps will, therefore, tend to precipitate dis-
ease emergence. Most emerging infections, and even
antibiotic-resistant strains of common bacterial
pathogens, usually originate in one geographic loca-
tion and then disseminate to new places (5).
Regarding the introduction step, the numerous
examples of infections originating as zoonoses (7,8)
suggest that the “zoonotic pool”—introductions of
infections from other species—is an important and
potentially rich source of emerging diseases; peri-
odic discoveries of “new” zoonoses suggest that the
zoonotic pool appears by no means exhausted. Once
introduced, an infection might then be disseminated
through other factors, although rapid course and
high mortality combined with low transmissibility
are often limiting. However, even if a zoonotic agent
is not able to spread readily from person to person
and establish itself, other factors (e.g., nosocomial
infection) might transmit the infection. Additionally,
if the reservoir host or vector becomes more widely
disseminated, the microbe can appear in new places.

from antigenic shift (genetic reassortment, generally between avian and mammalian influenza strains).

Bubonic plague transmitted by rodent fleas and
ratborne hantavirus infections are examples.
Most emerging infections appear to be caused by
pathogens already present in the environment,
brought out of obscurity or given a selective advan-
tage by changing conditions and afforded an oppor-
tunity to infect new host populations (on rare
occasions, a new variant may also evolve and cause
a new disease) (2,4). The process by which infectious
agents may transfer from animals to humans or
disseminate from isolated groups into new popula-
tions can be called “microbial traffic” (3,4). A number
of activities increase microbial traffic and as a result
promote emergence and epidemics. In some cases,
including many of the most novel infections, the
agents are zoonotic, crossing from their natural
hosts into the human population; because of the
many similarities, I include here vector-borne dis-
eases. In other cases, pathogens already present in
geographically isolated populations are given an
opportunity to disseminate further. Surprisingly
often, disease emergence is caused by human ac-
tions, however inadvertently; natural causes, such
as changes in climate, can also at times be respon-
sible (6). Although this discussion is confined largely
to human disease, similar considerations apply to
emerging pathogens in other species.
Table 2 summarizes the underlying factors re-
sponsible for emergence. Any categorization of the
factors is, of course, somewhat arbitrary but should
be representative of the underlying processes that
cause emergence. I have essentially adopted the
categories developed in the Institute of Medicine
report on emerging infections (12), with additional
definitions from the CDC emerging infections plan
(13). Responsible factors include ecological changes,
such as those due to agricultural or economic devel-
opment or to anomalies in climate; human demo-
graphic changes and behavior; travel and commerce;
technology and industry; microbial adaptation and
change; and breakdown of public health measures.
Each of these will be considered in turn.
Ecological interactions can be complex, with sev-
eral factors often working together or in sequence.
For example, population movement from rural areas
to cities can spread a once-localized infection. The
strain on infrastructure in the overcrowded and
rapidly growing cities may disrupt or slow public
health measures, perhaps allowing establishment of
the newly introduced infection. Finally, the city may
also provide a gateway for further dissemination of
the infection. Most successful emerging infections,
including HIV, cholera, and dengue, have followed
this route.
Consider HIV as an example. Although the pre-
cise ancestry of HIV-1 is still uncertain, it appears
to have had a zoonotic origin (9,10). Ecological fac-
tors that would have allowed human exposure to a
natural host carrying the virus that was the precur-
sor to HIV-1 were, therefore, instrumental in the
introduction of the virus into humans. This probably
occurred in a rural area. A plausible scenario is
suggested by the identification of an HIV-2-infected
man in a rural area of Liberia whose virus strain
resembled viruses isolated from the sooty mangabey
monkey (an animal widely hunted for food in rural
areas and the putative source of HIV-2) more closely
than it did strains circulating in the city (11). Such
findings suggest that zoonotic introductions of this
sort may occur on occasion in isolated populations
but may well go unnoticed so long as the recipients
remain isolated. But with increasing movement
from rural areas to cities, such isolation is increas-
ingly rare. After its likely first move from a rural
area into a city, HIV-1 spread regionally along high-
ways, then by long distance routes, including air
travel, to more distant places. This last step was
critical for HIV and facilitated today’s global pan-
demic. Social changes that allowed the virus to reach
a larger population and to be transmitted despite its
relatively low natural transmissibility were instru-
mental in the success of the virus in its newfound
human host. For HIV, the long duration of infectivity
allowed this normally poorly transmissible virus
many opportunities to be transmitted and to take
advantage of such factors as human behavior (sex-
ual transmission, intravenous drug use) and chang-
ing technology (early spread through blood
transfusions and blood products) (Table 1).
Ecological Changes and Agricultural
Development
Ecological changes, including those due to agri-
cultural or economic development, are among the
most frequently identified factors in emergence.
They are especially frequent as factors in outbreaks
of previously unrecognized diseases with high case-
fatality rates, which often turn out to be zoonotic
introductions. Ecological factors usually precipitate
emergence by placing people in contact with a natu-
ral reservoir or host for an infection hitherto unfa-
miliar but usually already present (often a zoonotic
or arthropod-borne infection), either by increasing
proximity or, often, also by changing conditions so
as to favor an increased population of the microbe or
its natural host (2,4). The emergence of Lyme dis-
ease in the United States and Europe was probably
due largely to reforestation (14), which increased the
population of deer and the deer tick, the vector of
Lyme disease. The movement of people into these
areas placed a larger population in close proximity
to the vector.
Agricultural development, one of the most com-
mon ways in which people alter and interpose them-
selves into the environment, is often a factor

(Table 2). Hantaan virus, the cause of Korean hem-
orrhagic fever, causes over 100,000 cases a year in
China and has been known in Asia for centuries. The
virus is a natural infection of the field mouse Apode-
mus agrarius. The rodent flourishes in rice fields;
people usually contract the disease during the rice
harvest from contact with infected rodents. Junin
virus, the cause of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, is
an unrelated virus with a history remarkably simi-
lar to that of Hantaan virus. Conversion of grass-
land to maize cultivation favored a rodent that was
the natural host for this virus, and human cases
increased in proportion with expansion of maize
agriculture (15). Other examples, in addition to
those already known (2,15), are likely to appear as
new areas are placed under cultivation.
Perhaps most surprisingly, pandemic influenza
appears to have an agricultural origin, integrated
pig-duck farming in China. Strains causing the fre-
quent annual or biennial epidemics generally result
from mutation (“antigenic drift”), but pandemic in-
fluenza viruses do not generally arise by this proc-
ess. Instead, gene segments from two influenza
strains reassort to produce a new virus that can
infect humans (16). Evidence amassed by Webster,
Scholtissek, and others, indicates that waterfowl,
such as ducks, are major reservoirs of influenza and
that pigs can serve as “mixing vessels” for new
mammalian influenza strains (16). Pandemic influ-
enza viruses have generally come from China.
Scholtissek and Naylor suggested that integrated
pig-duck agriculture, an extremely efficient food

production system traditionally practiced in certain
parts of China for several centuries, puts these two
species in contact and provides a natural laboratory
for making new influenza recombinants (17). Web-
ster has suggested that, with high-intensity agricul-
ture and movement of livestock across borders,
suitable conditions may now also be found in Europe
(16).
Water is also frequently associated with disease
emergence. Infections transmitted by mosquitoes or
other arthropods, which include some of the most
serious and widespread diseases (18,19), are often
stimulated by expansion of standing water, simply
because many of the mosquito vectors breed in
water. There are many cases of diseases transmitted
by water-breeding vectors, most involving dams,
water for irrigation, or stored drinking water in
cities. (See “Changes in Human Demographics and
Behavior” for a discussion of dengue.) The incidence
of Japanese encephalitis, another mosquito-borne
disease that accounts for almost 30,000 human
cases and approximately 7,000 deaths annually in
Asia, is closely associated with flooding of fields for
rice growing. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in some
parts of Africa have been associated with dam build-
ing as well as with periods of heavy rainfall (19). In
the outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in Mauritania in
1987, the human cases occurred in villages near
dams on the Senegal River. The same effect has been
documented with other infections that have aquatic
hosts, such as schistosomiasis.
Because humans are important agents of ecologi-
cal and environmental change, many of these factors
are anthropogenic. Of course, this is not always the
case, and natural environmental changes, such as
climate or weather anomalies, can have the same
effect. The outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syn-
drome in the southwestern United States in 1993 is
an example. It is likely that the virus has long been
present in mouse populations but an unusually mild
and wet winter and spring in that area led to an
increased rodent population in the spring and sum-
mer and thus to greater opportunities for people to
come in contact with infected rodents (and, hence,
with the virus); it has been suggested that the
weather anomaly was due to large-scale climatic
effects (20). The same causes may have been respon-
sible for outbreaks of hantaviral disease in Europe
at approximately the same time (21,22). With chol-
era, it has been suggested that certain organisms in
marine environments are natural reservoirs for
cholera vibrios, and that large scale effects on ocean
currents may cause local increases in the reservoir
organism with consequent flare-ups of cholera (23).
Changes in Human Demographics and
Behavior
Human population movements or upheavals,
caused by migration or war, are often important
factors in disease emergence. In many parts of the
world, economic conditions are encouraging the
mass movement of workers from rural areas to cit-
ies. The United Nations has estimated that, largely
as a result of continuing migration, by the year 2025,
65% of the world population (also expected to be
larger in absolute numbers), including 61% of the
population in developing regions, will live in cities
(24). As discussed above for HIV, rural urbanization
allows infections arising in isolated rural areas,
which may once have remained obscure and local-
ized, to reach larger populations. Once in a city, the
newly introduced infection would have the opportu-
nity to spread locally among the population and
could also spread further along highways and inter-
urban transport routes and by airplane. HIV has
been, and in Asia is becoming, the best known bene-
ficiary of this dynamic, but many other diseases,
such as dengue, stand to benefit. The frequency of
the most severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever,
which is thought to occur when a person is sequen-
tially infected by two types of dengue virus, is in-
creasing as different dengue viruses have extended
their range and now overlap (25). Dengue hemor-
rhagic fever is now common in some cities in Asia,
where the high prevalence of infection is attributed
to the proliferation of open containers needed for
water storage (which also provide breeding grounds
for the mosquito vector) as the population size ex-
ceeds the infrastructure (19). In urban environ-
ments, rain-filled tires or plastic bottles are often
breeding grounds of choice for mosquito vectors. The
resulting mosquito population boom is comple-
mented by the high human population density in
such situations, increasing the chances of stable
transmission cycles between infected and suscepti-
ble persons. Even in industrialized countries, e.g.,
the United States, infections such as tuberculosis
can spread through high-population density set-
tings (e.g., day care centers or prisons) (12,26-28).
Human behavior can have important effects on
disease dissemination. The best known examples
are sexually transmitted diseases, and the ways in
which such human behavior as sex or intravenous
drug use have contributed to the emergence of HIV
are now well known. Other factors responsible for
disease emergence are influenced by a variety of
human actions, so human behavior in the broader
sense is also very important. Motivating appropri-
ate individual behavior and constructive action,
both locally and in a larger scale, will be essential
for controlling emerging infections. Ironically, as
AIDS prevention efforts have demonstrated, human

behavior remains one of the weakest links in our
scientific knowledge.
International Travel and Commerce
The dissemination of HIV through travel has
already been mentioned. In the past, an infection
introduced into people in a geographically isolated
area might, on occasion, be brought to a new place
through travel, commerce, or war (8). Trade between
Asia and Europe, perhaps beginning with the silk
route and continuing with the Crusades, brought
the rat and one of its infections, the bubonic plague,
to Europe. Beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries,
ships bringing slaves from West Africa to the New
World also brought yellow fever and its mosquito
vector, Aedes aegypti, to the new territories. Simi-
larly, smallpox escaped its Old World origins to
wreak new havoc in the New World. In the 19th
century, cholera had similar opportunities to spread
from its probable origin in the Ganges plain to the
Middle East and, from there, to Europe and much of
the remaining world. Each of these infections had
once been localized and took advantage of opportu-
nities to be carried to previously unfamiliar parts of
the world.
Similar histories are being repeated today, but
opportunities in recent years have become far richer
and more numerous, reflecting the increasing vol-
ume, scope, and speed of traffic in an increasingly
mobile world. Rats have carried hantaviruses virtu-
ally worldwide (29). Aedes albopictus (the Asian
tiger mosquito) was introduced into the United
States, Brazil, and parts of Africa in shipments of
used tires from Asia (30). Since its introduction in
1982, this mosquito has established itself in at least
18 states of the United States and has acquired local
viruses including Eastern equine encephalomyelitis
(31), a cause of serious disease. Another mosquito-
borne disease, malaria, is one of the most frequently
imported diseases in non-endemic-disease areas,
and cases of “airport malaria” are occasionally iden-
tified.
A classic bacterial disease, cholera, recently en-
tered both South America (for the first time this
century) and Africa. Molecular typing shows the
South American isolates to be of the current pan-
demic strain (32), supporting the suggestion that the
organism was introduced in contaminated bilge
water from an Asian freighter (33). Other evidence
indicates that cholera was only one of many organ-
isms to travel in ballast water; dozens, perhaps
hundreds, of species have been exchanged between
distant places through this means of transport
alone. New bacterial strains, such as the recently
identified Vibrio cholerae O139, or an epidemic
strain of Neisseria meningitidis (34,35) (also exam-
ples of microbial adaptation and change) have dis-
seminated rapidly along routes of trade and travel,
as have antibiotic-resistant bacteria (5,36).
Technology and Industry
High-volume rapid movement characterizes not
only travel, but also other industries in modern
society. In operations, including food production,
that process or use products of biological origin,
modern production methods yield increased effi-
ciency and reduced costs but can increase the
chances of accidental contamination and amplify the
effects of such contamination. The problem is fur-
ther compounded by globalization, allowing the op-
portunity to introduce agents from far away. A
pathogen present in some of the raw material may
find its way into a large batch of final product, as
happened with the contamination of hamburger
meat by E. coli strains causing hemolytic uremic
syndrome (37). In the United States the implicated
E. coli strains are serotype O157:H7; additional
serotypes have been identified in other countries.
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which
emerged in Britain within the last few years, was
likely an interspecies transfer of scrapie from sheep
to cattle (38) that occurred when changes in render-
ing processes led to incomplete inactivation of scra-
pie agent in sheep byproducts fed to cattle (39).
The concentrating effects that occur with blood
and tissue products have inadvertently dissemi-
nated infections unrecognized at the time, such as
HIV and hepatitis B and C. Medical settings are also
at the front line of exposure to new diseases, and a
number of infections, including many emerging in-
fections, have spread nosocomially in health care
settings (Table 2). Among the numerous examples,
in the outbreaks of Ebola fever in Africa many of the
secondary cases were hospital acquired, most trans-
mitted to other patients through contaminated hy-
podermic apparatus, and some to the health care
staff by contact. Transmission of Lassa fever to
health care workers has also been documented.
On the positive side, advances in diagnostic tech-
nology can also lead to new recognition of agents
that are already widespread. When such agents are
newly recognized, they may at first often be labeled,
in some cases incorrectly, as emerging infections.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was identified only a
few years ago, but the virus appears to be extremely
widespread (40) and has recently been implicated as
the cause of roseola (exanthem subitum), a very
common childhood disease (41). Because roseola has
been known since at least 1910, HHV-6 is likely to
have been common for decades and probably much
longer. Another recent example is the bacterium
Helicobacter pylori, a probable cause of gastric ul-
cers (42) and some cancers (43,44). We have lived
with these diseases for a long time without knowing

their cause. Recognition of the agent is often advan-
tageous, offering new promise of controlling a pre-
viously intractable disease, such as treating gastric
ulcers with specific antimicrobial therapy.
Microbial Adaptation and Change
Microbes, like all other living things, are con-
stantly evolving. The emergence of antibiotic-resis-
tant bacteria as a result of the ubiquity of
antimicrobials in the environment is an evolution-
ary lesson on microbial adaptation, as well as a
demonstration of the power of natural selection.
Selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria (5,36) and
drug-resistant parasites has become frequent,
driven by the wide and sometimes inappropriate use
of antimicrobial drugs in a variety of applications
(27,45,46). Pathogens can also acquire new antibi-
otic resistance genes from other, often nonpatho-
genic, species in the environment (36), selected or
perhaps even driven by the selection pressure of
antibiotics.
Many viruses show a high mutation rate and can
rapidly evolve to yield new variants (47). A classic
example is influenza (48). Regular annual epidemics
are caused by “antigenic drift” in a previously circu-
lating influenza strain. A change in an antigenic site
of a surface protein, usually the hemagglutinin (H)
protein, allows the new variant to reinfect pre-
viously infected persons because the altered antigen
is not immediately recognized by the immune
system.
On rare occasions, perhaps more often with non-
viral pathogens than with viruses (49), the evolution
of a new variant may result in a new expression of
disease. The epidemic of Brazilian purpuric fever in
1990, associated with a newly emerged clonal vari-
ant of Hemophilus influenzae, biogroup aegyptius,
may fall into this category. It is possible, but not yet
clear, that some recently described manifestations
of disease by group A Streptococcus, such as rapidly
invasive infection or necrotizing fasciitis, may also
fall into this category.
Breakdown of Public Health Measures
and Deficiencies in Public Health
Infrastructure
Classical public health and sanitation measures
have long served to minimize dissemination and
human exposure to many pathogens spread by tra-
ditional routes such as water or preventable by
immunization or vector control. The pathogens
themselves often still remain, albeit in reduced
numbers, in reservoir hosts or in the environment,
or in small pockets of infection and, therefore, are
often able to take advantage of the opportunity to
reemerge if there are breakdowns in preventive
measures.
Reemerging diseases are those, like cholera, that
were once decreasing but are now rapidly increasing
again. These are often conventionally understood
and well recognized public health threats for which
(in most cases) previously active public health meas-
ures had been allowed to lapse, a situation that
unfortunately now applies all too often in both de-
veloping countries and the inner cities of the indus-
trialized world. The appearance of reemerging
diseases may, therefore, often be a sign of the break-
down of public health measures and should be a
warning against complacency in the war against
infectious diseases.
Cholera, for example, has recently been raging in
South America (for the first time in this century) (50)
and Africa. The rapid spread of cholera in South
America may have been abetted by recent reduc-
tions in chlorine levels used to treat water supplies
(34). The success of cholera and other enteric dis-
eases is often due to the lack of a reliable water
supply. These problems are more severe in develop-
ing countries, but are not confined to these areas.
The U.S. outbreak of waterborne Cryptosporidium
infection in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the spring of
1993, with over 400,000 estimated cases, was in part
due to a nonfunctioning water filtration plant (51);
similar deficiencies in water purification have been
found in other cities in the United States (52).
For our Future
In his accompanying article, Dr. David Satcher
discusses the history of infectious diseases and the
many infections that, from the dawn of history to the
present, have traveled with the caravans and fol-
lowed the invading armies. The history of infectious
diseases has been a history of microbes on the
march, often in our wake, and of microbes that have
taken advantage of the rich opportunities offered
them to thrive, prosper, and spread. And yet the
historical processes that have given rise to the emer-
gence of “new” infections throughout history con-
tinue today with unabated force; in fact, they are
accelerating, because the conditions of modern life
ensure that the factors responsible for disease emer-
gence are more prevalent than ever before. Speed of
travel and global reach are further borne out by
studies modeling the spread of influenza epidemics
(53) and HIV (54,55).
Humans are not powerless, however, against this
relentless march of microbes. Knowledge of the fac-
tors underlying disease emergence can help focus
resources on the key situations and areas worldwide
(3,4) and develop more effective prevention strate-
gies. If we are to protect ourselves against emerging
diseases, the essential first step is effective global

disease surveillance to give early warning of emerg-
ing infections (3,12,13,56). This must be tied to in-
centives, such as national development, and
eventually be backed by a system for an appropriate
rapid response. World surveillance capabilities are
critically deficient (12,56,57). Efforts, such as the
CDC plan (13), now under way in the United States
and internationally to remedy this situation are the
essential first steps and deserve strong support.
Research, both basic and applied, will also be vital.
This Journal and the “Perspectives”
Section
Early warning of emerging and reemerging infec-
tions depends on the ability to identify the unusual
as early as possible. Information is, therefore, essen-
tial. Hence this journal, which is intended as a
peer-reviewed forum for the discussion of concepts
and examples relevant to emerging infectious dis-
eases and their causes, and to provide a channel for
field reports and observations on emerging infec-
tions. The “Perspectives” section will provide gen-
eral overviews dealing with factors in disease
emergence, conceptual syntheses of information, ap-
proaches for studying or predicting emerging infec-
tions, and analyses that shed light on how and why
infections emerge, and how they may be anticipated
and prevented. Submissions for this section are
warmly invited. In coming issues, Perspectives will
deal in greater detail with many of the factors dis-
cussed in this overview article, and with ways to
dissect steps in the emergence process. Discussion
of technologies that are broadly applicable to the
identification or control of emerging diseases are
also appropriate for this section. Case studies are
welcome if they are used to develop broader lessons.

RESEARCH
On January 25, 2017, a physician from ZC Hospital in 
Hangzhou, China, reported to the Zhejiang Provincial 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention that a poten­
tial HIV outbreak might have occurred during lympho­
cyte immunotherapy (LIT) performed at the hospital on 
December 30, 2016. We immediately began investigat­
ing and identified the index case-patient as an LIT pa­
tient’s husband who donated lymphocytes for his wife’s 
LIT and later screened HIV-reactive. Subsequent con­
tamination by a technician resulted in the potential ex­
posure of 34 LIT patients. Acute HIV infection was diag­
nosed in 5 persons. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that 
the HIV-1 gag, pol, and env gene sequences from the 
index and outbreak-related cases had >99.5% similar­
ity. Rapid investigation and implementation of effective 
control measures successfully controlled the outbreak. 
This incident provides evidence of a lapse in infection 
control causing HIV transmission, highlighting the need 
for stronger measures to protect patients from infectious 
disease exposure.
L
ymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) to treat recurrent 
miscarriage involves receipt of lymphocytes to a 
patient from a donor, usually the patient’s male partner. 
Although the European Society of Human Reproduction 
and Embryology (1), the Royal College of Obstetricians 
(2), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gyne­
cologists (3) have issued clear guidance against LIT, sup­
ported by a 2014 Cochrane review (4), more recent meta-
analyses support its use (5,6), as do 4 newer intervention 
control studies conducted in China (7–10). Although the 
number of LIT recipients in China is estimated to be large, 
no statistics are available. Within China’s healthcare 
system, LIT is a category III medical service, meaning 
that each hospital regulates itself (11).
On January 24, 2017, a woman receiving LIT at ZC 
Hospital in Hangzhou, China, called a hospital staff mem­
ber, Dr. X, asking if she had risk for HIV infection. She 
explained that her husband had just received a confirmed 
diagnosis of HIV infection and that on December 30, 
2016, she had received LIT using lymphocytes her hus­
band donated. Dr. X immediately reported this informa­
tion to the hospital’s deputy director, who informed the 
clinical medical laboratory director, Dr. Y. At ≈4:00 pm 
the same day, Dr. Y informed the responsible laboratory 
technician, Dr. Z, and requested that she stop LIT. One 
hour later, Dr. Z voluntarily reported to Dr. Y that she had 
deviated from protocol on December 30 and that other 
patients who received LIT on the same day might have 
been exposed. At 5:30 pm, the director of ZC Hospital 
called an emergency meeting with department directors, 
who decided to request help from the Zhejiang Provin­
cial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Zhejiang 
CDC). On January 25, 2017, Zhejiang CDC epidemiolo­
gists began investigating a possible HIV outbreak among 
LIT recipients at ZC Hospital. We report on the inves­
tigation conducted, control measures implemented, and 
outcomes observed.
Methods
The potential HIV outbreak at ZC Hospital was declared 
a public health emergency, and a formal investigation be­
gan on January 25, 2017, supported by provincial (Zheji­
ang Health Commission and Zhejiang CDC) and national 
(National Health Commission and National Center for 
AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention [China CDC]) authori­
ties and resources. Neither institutional review board ap­
proval nor individual informed consent was required for 
the investigation. Routine informed consent for HIV,

SYNOPSIS
hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syph­
ilis testing (oral or written) and for contact tracing (oral) 
was obtained.
Case Definition, Case Finding, and Contact Tracing
We defined an outbreak-related case as a newly diagnosed 
laboratory-confirmed HIV infection, with evidence of 
acute infection suggesting occurrence of transmission on 
December 30, 2016, among women who had received LIT 
at ZC Hospital that day or their secondary contacts, with 
HIV gene sequence highly related to that of the index case-
patient. Initial case finding began among all women who 
received LIT at ZC Hospital on December 30. A trained 
public health specialist conducted interviews on HIV risk 
behavior during December 30, 2016–January 25, 2017, to 
assess the possibility that HIV infection had been acquired 
by means other than LIT and that HIV already had been 
transmitted to others.
HIV, HBV, HCV, and Syphilis Testing
All potential outbreak-related case-patients and their 
contacts were provided free testing and counseling at ZC 
Hospital. Persons in whom HIV infection was diagnosed 
were referred to treatment. For HIV, serologic screening 
was conducted at ZC Hospital’s laboratory using the 
Anti-HIV (1+2) 4th-generation antigen/antibody enzyme 
immunoassay (EIA) kit (Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering, 
Shanghai, China) and the HIV 1/2/O Tri-Line HIV Rapid 
Test Device (ABON Biopharm, Hangzhou). If reactive, 
new venous blood specimens were collected and sent to 
the Hangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
laboratory for confirmatory serologic testing by Western 
blot (WB; MP Biomedicals, Singapore). In parallel, 
plasma specimens were sent to the Zhejiang CDC, where 
HIV nucleic acid testing was conducted using COBAS 
AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test v2.0 kits (Roche, 
Branchburg, NJ, USA).
HBV, HCV, and syphilis testing were performed at ZC 
Hospital’s laboratory. For HBV, samples were screened 
for 5 indicators (i.e., hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis 
B surface antibody, hepatitis B e-antigen, hepatitis B 
e-antibody, hepatitis B c-antibody) using EIA kits (InTec 
Products, Xiamen, China). For HCV, samples were screened 
for antibodies using an EIA kit (Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics, 
Zhuhai, China). For syphilis, samples were initially 
screened by Toluidine Red Untreated Serum Test (TRUST, 
Shanghai Rongsheng Biotech, Shanghai, China). Reactive 
samples were confirmed by Treponema pallidum particle 
agglutination assay (Fujirebio Inc., Nagasaki, Japan).
Laboratory Audit
An audit of the hospital laboratory began immediately on 
January 25 and lasted 6 days. It was conducted by 3 trained 
compliance specialists and 3 public health officials from 
independent institutions. They thoroughly reviewed all 
relevant records: staffing, training, qualification, certifica­
tion, security, inventory, equipment, LIT protocol, compli­
ance, supervision, and infection control procedures, as well 
as records generated during the execution of LIT-related 
procedures. The audit also included private interviews 
with all laboratory staff and direct observation of staff re­
hearsing LIT procedures; investigation of other potential 
violations of protocol that might have caused nosocomi­
al transmission; and a check of baseline laboratory tests 
for HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis for all 34 women and 
their husbands.
Molecular Phylogeny Analysis
All HIV sequencing was performed at the Zhejiang CDC 
laboratory using plasma specimens. Two technicians in 
separate laboratory areas extracted HIV RNA from speci­
mens, each using a different method: one used the QIAamp 
Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), the 
other a viral RNA/DNA extraction kit on an automatic ex­
traction platform (Suzhou Tianlong, Suzhou, China). Par­
tial sequences for the HIV genes gag, pol, and env were 
amplified by reverse transcription PCR and nested PCR us­
ing GUX/GDX primers for gag, 5 different pairs of primers 
for pol, and M13F/M13R primers for env. PCR products 
were confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and then 
purified and sequenced.
We analyzed sequences with Sequencher v5.0 (Gene 
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), examined them 
for similarity, and aligned them to reference sequences us­
ing BioEdit v7.2.0 (Ibis Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 
Two sets of reference sequences for each gene were selected 
for comparison to outbreak-related consensus sequences. 
The first set was international reference sequences obtained 
from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (https://www.
hiv.lanl.gov). The second was representative of strains cir­
culating in the area at the time of the outbreak. We used the 
neighbor-joining tree method (Kimura 2-parameter model) 
to determine HIV subtype and phylogenetic relationships 
and genetic distance between sequences. Two technicians 
blindly and independently analyzed 2 specimens from each 
patient. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were con­
structed using MEGA 6.0 (https://www.megasoftware.net) 
with 1,000 replicate bootstrap alignments. We defined a 
transmission cluster as having a bootstrap value >90% and 
a mean genetic distance of <0.015.
Results
Epidemiologic Investigation
Mrs. P0, age 36, is the wife of the index-case patient, P0, 
and had been enrolled in LIT starting June 21, 2016. At 
2142	
Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 24, No. 12, December 2018
HIV Infection Linked to Nosocomial Transmission
enrollment, P0 and Mrs. P0 both underwent behavioral 
health screening, physical examination, and HIV testing 
(both tested HIV negative). Mrs. P0 received LIT on July 
19, August 16, September 13, October 14, November 11, 
December 2, and December 30, 2016, at ZC Hospital, 
each time with lymphocytes donated by her husband 
3 days before her LIT dates. Later in the day after her 
December 30 treatment, Mrs. P0 learned that her husband 
had screened HIV reactive. On December 31, Mrs. P0 went 
to XX Hospital in Hangzhou, which treats persons living 
with HIV, where she informed the physician she had just 
discovered she was pregnant and had great concern about 
possible exposure to HIV by LIT because her husband had 
just screened HIV-reactive, which she worried she might 
transmit to her unborn baby. She was strongly encouraged 
to immediately begin postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), 
using a regimen of 3 antiretroviral medications (tenofovir, 
lopinavir/ritonavir, and lamivudine) for 4 weeks. She 
started PEP the same day.
Upon attending antenatal care shortly thereafter, Mrs. 
P0 tested negative for HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis. On 
January 24, 2017, after her husband received a confirmed 
diagnosis of HIV infection, Mrs. P0 alerted staff at ZC 
Hospital that she was concerned she was exposed to HIV 
via LIT on December 30, 2016; this report was the initiating 
event that sparked the outbreak investigation. As part of the 
investigation, Mrs. P0 was followed and regularly tested for 
HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis. All results were repeatedly 
negative. Her PEP regimen was converted to a prevention 
of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) program (same 
medicines extended to 8 weeks after delivery).
Mrs. P0’s baby was born on July 9, 2017, and Mrs. P0 
stopped all use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the same 
day. Her most recent HIV screening test was performed on 
March 9, 2018, at 9 months since she stopped ART and >14 
months since her exposure. Her results remained negative.
Index Case-Patient
P0 was the 40-year-old husband of Mrs. P0. Public 
health workers constructed a 2-month timeline related 
to his HIV exposure and testing (Figure 1). His most 
recent negative HIV screening result was on November 
27, 2016. The residual specimen was retested using a 
4th-generation antigen/antibody test during the investi­
gation and confirmed negative. The exposure event that 
probably led to P0’s HIV infection was traced to Decem­
ber 1, 2016, when he had condomless, receptive anal sex 
with a man he did not know at a gay bathhouse. Approxi­
mately 2 weeks later, fever developed, and he began to 
suspect HIV infection.
P0 went to the Yiwu CDC for HIV testing on Friday, 
December 23, but his specimen was not tested until De­
cember 29 (HIV testing by both antibody-only and anti­
body/antigen EIA is only performed on Thursdays at Yiwu 
CDC). He was not informed of his reactive result until on 
December 30, at which time he was encouraged to return 
for confirmatory testing. However, P0 instead sought re­
screening at another facility. He returned for confirmatory 
testing on January 3, 2017. His first WB result was indeter­
minate (gp160/p24). His second result (using a new speci­
men obtained on January 23) was positive (gp160/gp120/
p66/p31/p24), and his viral load (VL) was 121,000 copies/

SYNOPSIS
mL. P0 was informed of his HIV diagnosis on January 24 
and started treatment the next day. He tested negative for 
HBV, HCV, and syphilis. Investigators determined that P0 
made no other donations of fluids, cells, or tissues after his 
exposure on December 1, 2016.
Laboratory Investigation
The audit of the LIT laboratory resulted in 5 main find­
ings. First, although the appropriate protocol was used 
and requires that each disposable sterile tube for lympho­
cyte processing is used only once, the laboratory expe­
rienced a shortage of these tubes for 1 day on December 
30. To provide LIT to 34 women, >136 tubes were need­
ed (34 for moving lymphocytes from culture containers 
to washing plates and 102 for washing the 34 cultures 3 
times each). Approximately 100 tubes were available on 
December 30. Second, instead of stopping and calling 
this issue to the attention of a supervisor, the laboratory 
technician processing donated lymphocytes for LIT on 
December 30 deviated from protocol and reused tubes. 
Deviations occurred in 2 procedures: tubes were used re­
peatedly for moving lymphocytes from culture contain­
ers to washing plates and for washing the lymphocyte 
cultures. Third, the technician failed to properly docu­
ment the work performed and upon interview, admitted 
to reusing disposable tubes “a few times,” but could not 
remember how many times or for which couples. Fourth, 
no deviation occurred on December 27 that could have 
caused contamination during blood specimen collection, 
lymphocyte separation, or lymphocyte culturing. Final­
ly, LIT was performed at ZC Hospital only ≈1 time each 
month. No LIT had yet been conducted during December 
30, 2016–January 25, 2017. No evidence of these failures, 
or other failures that could have similarly resulted in 
nosocomial transmission of HIV, was found before De­
cember 30 or during December 31–January 25.
The auditors concluded that lymphocyte processing 
deviated from the protocol on December 30 and that the 
technician responsible contaminated an unknown number 
of patients’ prepared lymphocytes on December 30 with 
lymphocytes from the index case-patient. Thus, all patients 
who received LIT on December 30 should be tested as if 
they had potentially been exposed. Auditors recommended 
that all the women and their husbands be tested for HIV, 
HBV, HCV, and syphilis.
Contact Tracing
Along with Mrs. P0, 33 other women received LIT at ZC 
Hospital on December 30. A medical records review found 
that all 33 had tested negative for HIV, HBV, HCV, and 
syphilis before beginning LIT in 2016. None reported 
any HIV risk behavior other than sexual contact, and 
none reported sexual contact with anyone other than their 
husbands. All 33 women (possible primary contacts) and 
their husbands (possible secondary contacts) were tested 
for HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis. Five cases of HIV were 
found (Figure 2).
Case-Patient 1
P1, age 35 (not pregnant) at the time of the investigation, 
received LIT at ZC Hospital on November 4, December 
2, and December 30, 2016. She reported having fever, 
sore throat, and other symptoms, for which she had been 
given penicillin at a local clinic for a suspected bacterial 
infection. HIV serologic results were nonreactive, but 
virologic results were positive with VL of 756,000 copies/

received LIT at ZC Hospital on October 10, November 
4, December 2, and December 30, 2016. She had muscle 
soreness and fever but did not seek care. HIV screening 
results were nonreactive; however, virologic results were 
positive with VL of 841,000 copies/mL on January 26, 
2017, suggesting acute infection. Confirmatory WB result 
was positive (gp160/gp120/p24) on January 31, and she 
was informed of her diagnosis on the same day. She began 
ART on February 9, 2017.
Case-Patient 4
P4, age 28 and pregnant (17 weeks’ gestation) at the 
time of the investigation, received LIT at ZC Hospital on 
March 4, April 1, April 29, May 27, June 24, July 29, 
August 19, November 18, December 9, and December 30, 
2016. She reported symptoms including feeling cold and 
red allergy-like spots on her chest but did not see a doctor. 
HIV screening results were nonreactive, but virologic 
results were positive with VL of 3,000,000 copies/mL 
on January 31, 2017, suggesting acute infection. First 
confirmatory WB result was indeterminate (gp160/p24); 
second was positive (gp160/gp120/p24). P4 was informed 
of her diagnosis, enrolled in PMTCT, and initiated on 
ART on February 2.
Case-Patient 5
P5, age 34 (not pregnant) at the time of the investigation, 
received LIT at ZC Hospital only on December 30, 2016. 
She reported no symptoms. HIV screening results were 
nonreactive, but virologic results were positive with VL of 
6,460,000 copies/mL on January 26, 2017, suggesting acute 
infection. First confirmatory WB result was indeterminate 
(gp160), but the second was positive (gp160/gp120/p24). 
P5 was informed of her diagnosis and initiated ART on 
February 9.
Other Contacts
The remaining 29 women, including Mrs. P0, the wife of 
the index case-patient, all had multiple negative serologic 
and virologic results during follow-up (Table 1, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0117-T1.htm). 
None had HBV, HCV, or syphilis.
Although all 33 husbands were tested initially, 3 
husbands of the 5 women with newly diagnosed HIV 
infection, all of whom who reported sexual contact with 
their wives after December 30, 2016, were followed and 
provided HIV serologic and virologic testing, as well as 
HBV, HCV, and syphilis testing. All results were negative. 
Additionally, the infants of Mrs. P0 (born July 9, 2017), P2 
(born August 14, 2017), and P4 (born July 3, 2017) were 
tested for HIV by early infant diagnosis (EID; by PCR) and 
were HIV-negative.
Phylogenetic Investigation
The HIV sequences derived from the index case-patient 
and the 5 women with newly diagnosed HIV infection 
shared a very high degree of similarity: mean of 99.95% 
for gag, 99.48% for pol, and 99.92% for env (Table 2). 
The gag and pol sequences were consistent with HIV-
1 subtype CRF01_AE, and env sequences were subtype 
as C, indicating that all 6 persons were infected with a 
recombinant CRF01_AE/C strain. Phylogenetic trees of 
gag, pol, and env sequences (Figure 3) indicate a very 
close genetic relationship between the virus present in the 5 
women with newly diagnosed infection and the index case-
patient. The sequences of all 3 genes map to monophyletic 
clusters in 100% of bootstrap replicates with genetic 
distances of <0.015.
Summary of Outbreak Response
In response to this outbreak, the National Health 
Commission immediately suspended all LIT services 
nationwide, and all 34 couples involved were provided 
counseling and support. The epidemiologic investigation 
found that a lymphocyte donor (P0) had become infected 
with HIV before donation on December 27 and that 
laboratory contamination occurred on December 30, 
which together caused 5 women to become infected 
with HIV. HIV phylogenetic investigation confirmed the 
causal relationship. All 5 women had initiated ART as 
of February 9, 2017, only 15 days after the investigation 
began. All remaining 29 women who initially screened 
nonreactive and the husbands of the 5 infected women 
were followed up for 6 months; no additional HIV 
infections were found. The 3 pregnant women were 
provided PMTCT; their newborn infants were followed

SYNOPSIS
up, and no HIV infection was found. The laboratory 
technician was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison. The 
hospital director, deputy director, and division chief 
accountable for the laboratory were dismissed. LIT 
services were suspended until a new guideline was 
issued on December 22, 2017 (12).
Discussion
These epidemiologic and phylogenetic investigations used 
techniques similar to those used during HIV outbreak in­
vestigations including a famous case of a Florida, USA, 
dentist (13–16); several criminal cases (17–20); a prison 
outbreak in Scotland, UK (21); 2 nosocomial outbreaks

‡Mrs. P0 is the wife of the index case-patient, P0. She is continuing to be followed once a year for at least 3 years since she discontinued antiretroviral 
therapy. Her most recent HIV test, on March 9, 2018, was again negative. 
§For husbands, beginning of the time interval was counted from the most recent sexual contact with the wife from the wife’s exposure on December 30, 
2016, through the start of the investigation on January 25, 2017. Husbands received both serologic (4th-generation Ag/Ab EIA, Shanghai Kehua Bio-
Engineering, Shanghai, China) and virologic testing (HIV-1 RNA, COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test v2.0, Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA). 
¶For infants, beginning of the time interval was counted as the date of birth. The first 3 HIV tests for infants were early infant diagnosis tests by a standard 
nucleic acid testing protocol. The fourth test for infant P0 was a 4th-generation Ag/Ab EIA.

HIV Infection Linked to Nosocomial Transmission
(22,23); and a recent outbreak in Indiana, USA, associated 
with injection drug use (24). These investigations identi­
fied P0 as the index case-patient for this nosocomial HIV 
outbreak and demonstrate that deviation from protocol and 
lapse in infection control during LIT were the cause. We 
have yet to detect HIV infection in Mrs. P0, the wife of the 
index case-patient, suggesting that her immediate initiation 
of PEP might have averted infection. However, we are un­
able to definitively determine Mrs. P0’s HIV status because 
she has been followed for only 9 months since she discon­
tinued ART, and evidence of viremic rebound nearly 30 
months after ART cessation was observed in the case of a 
child in Mississippi, USA (25,26). These results underscore 
the critical importance of quickly investigating a suspected 
outbreak. Among the 34 women potentially exposed, only 
5 acquired infections, and potential onward transmission of 
HIV to their husbands and infants was averted.
This study was subject to at least 2 limitations. First, 
follow-up HIV testing for the 29 potentially exposed women 
was voluntary, and some declined to have third and fourth 
HIV tests. For example, Q17 was followed up at 27 days 
(with nucleic acid testing and antigen/antibody EIA) and 33 
days (antigen/antibody EIA only) and, although unlikely, it 
is possible that she had undetected HIV infection. Second, as 
noted, we were unable to definitively ascertain Mrs. P0’s HIV 
status within the scope of this study. Hence, HIV infection 
linked to this outbreak might not yet have been diagnosed.
The results of this outbreak investigation offer im­
portant lessons that China must not ignore. First, the 
unacceptably long process of HIV diagnosis in China di­
rectly contributed to this outbreak. Ample evidence of the 
substantial benefit of streamlining and accelerating Chi­
na’s HIV care continuum already exists (27–29). How­
ever, although a rapid 1-visit testing, diagnosis, clinical 
staging, and ART initiation protocol has been adopted, 
China must accelerate the pace at which these changes are 
implemented if it is to avoid another, similar outbreak.
Second, China must implement more frequent and 
thorough training for medical professionals on the risks of 
nosocomial HIV transmission. The finding that Mrs. P0’s 
attending physician at XX Hospital was concerned enough 
to start her on PEP but not to alert public health officials 
and the finding that the laboratory technician did not con­
sider reusing sterile tubes to be unsafe both indicate that 
education about the risks for nosocomial HIV transmission 
is still lacking. China must act quickly to fill this gap.
Finally, laboratories in medical settings must be 
placed under stricter controls. Immediate supervision and 
monitoring and thorough and frequent laboratory audits 
should be implemented immediately in China’s medical 
laboratories. A high level of vigilance in the medical 
laboratory setting is critical if China is to prevent similar 
future nosocomial outbreaks.

We summarize and analyze historical and current data re­
garding the reemergence of St. Louis encephalitis virus 
(SLEV; genus Flavivirus) in the Americas. Historically, SLEV 
caused encephalitis outbreaks in the United States; however, 
it was not considered a public health concern in the rest of the 
Americas. After the introduction of West Nile virus in 1999, 
activity of SLEV decreased considerably in the United States. 
During 2014–2015, SLEV caused a human outbreak in Ari­
zona and caused isolated human cases in California in 2016 
and 2017. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the emerging 
SLEV in the western United States is related to the epidem­
ic strains isolated during a human encephalitis outbreak in 
Córdoba, Argentina, in 2005. Ecoepidemiologic studies sug­
gest that the emergence of SLEV in Argentina was caused by 
the introduction of a more pathogenic strain and increasing 
populations of the eared dove (amplifying host).

SYNOPSIS
 Reemergence of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus 
T
he disease known as St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) is 
caused by St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), identi­
fied as the causative agent of a mosquitoborne viral epi­
demic in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, during the summer 
of 1933 (1). SLEV is transmitted by numerous mosquito 
species in the genus Culex and is amplified by passerine 
and columbiform avian species (1). Phylogenetic analysis 
based on the full-length E gene sequences grouped SLEV 
strains into 8 genotypes (2). Genotypes I and II are preva­
lent in the United States and genotype V is widely distrib­
uted in South America. Other genotypes have limited dis­
tribution: genotype III is in southern South America, IV is 
limited to Colombia and Panama, VI is in Panama, VII is in 
Argentina, and VIII has been detected only in the Amazon 
region of Brazil (2).
A retrospective analysis revealed that 38 human cas­
es and 14 deaths were caused by SLEV in Paris, Illinois, 
USA, during the summer of 1932 (3). A 1933 SLE epidem­
ic resulted in 1,095 clinical human cases and 201 deaths 
(3). Because subclinical cases are not identified or reported, 
retrospective serosurveys were conducted to determine the 
ratio of subclinical to clinical infections, which was deter­
mined to be 300:1 (3). Using this ratio, the actual number 
of SLE cases during the 1933 SLE epidemic was ≈328,500, 
affecting nearly 40% of the city’s 821,960 inhabitants, 
based on US census data for 1930 (4).
Since SLEV was first identified, 4 human SLE trans­
mission scenarios have been reported (5). First, during 
most years, no human SLE infections are reported. How­
ever, SLEV transmission to sentinel animals and virus iso­
lation from mosquito pools is documented in the absence 
of human cases. Second, small numbers of spatially and 
temporally isolated human SLE cases occur. For example, 
in 1993, 8 human SLE cases were reported in Lee and Col­
lier counties, Florida, USA; 5 of the cases reported onset 
during October (6). Third, sporadic transmission occurs as 
widely dispersed (temporally and spatially) individual hu­
man cases. For example, in 1997, 9 human SLE cases were 
reported from 6 Florida counties, ranging from Brevard 
County on the central Atlantic Coast south to Lee County 
on the southern Gulf Coast. Onset for these cases ranged 
from July through late October (6). Finally, epidemic trans­
mission occurs as focused (in space and time) clusters of 
human clinical cases: for example, an extensive 1975 epi­
demic that occurred along the Mississippi and Ohio River 
basins from Ontario, Canada; Cleveland, Ohio; and Chi­
cago, Illinois, in the north to Birmingham, Alabama, and 
Mississippi in the south. Well-documented SLE outbreaks 
include the 1933 St. Louis epidemic and the 1959, 1961, 
1962, 1977, and 1990 epidemics in southern Florida. Other 
epidemics of note occurred in St. Louis (1937); Hidalgo 
County, Texas (1954); High Plains, Texas; Louisville, Ken­
tucky; and Cameron County, Texas (1956); and Houston, 
Texas (1964). There was also a 1990 SLE epidemic in Flor­
ida (5), and, most recently, a 2015 epidemic in the Phoenix 
area of Arizona (Figure 1).
Epidemics of SLE are promoted by environmental 
factors including summer temperature, rainfall, snowmelt, 
and surface water conditions (7,8). One of the most notable 
environmental drivers for SLEV activity is the cycling 
of rainfall and drought. The wet–dry cycle can affect the 
epidemiology of SLEV by forcing gravid floodwater Culex 
vectors to delay oviposition long enough to complete viral 
development (extrinsic incubation) in a single gonotrophic 
cycle, thus making them capable of viral transmission 
during their second blood meal (8). Drought has also been 
linked to urban SLE and West Nile virus (WNV) epidemics 
involving vectors in the Cx. pipiens complex (9).
Transmission Cycles
The 4 primary vectors of SLEV in the United States are 
Cx. pipiens pipiens Linnaeus, Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus 
Say, Cx. tarsalis Coquillett, and Cx. nigripalpus Theobald 
mosquitoes (1). Vector species distribution determines the 
geographic distribution of SLEV, and affects whether epi­
demics are urban or rural. Urban SLE epidemics usually 
involve Cx. pipiens pipiens and Cx. pipiens quinquefas­
ciatus (Cx. pipiens complex) mosquitoes, species that ovi­
posit in the permanent aquatic habitats provided by storm 
drains, sewage treatment facilities, and wastewater reten­
tion ponds. Rural SLE epidemics usually involve floodwa­
ter species, such as Cx. tarsalis and Cx. nigripalpus mos­
quitoes (1). Urban and rural epidemic transmission patterns 
are best demonstrated by the history of SLE in Florida, 
where urban human SLEV cases were detected in Miami 
in 1952 and 1954, followed by St. Petersburg in 1959, 
Tampa in 1961, and Sarasota in 1962. In 1977, SLEV epi­
demic transmission in Florida shifted from urban to rural 
areas (7). The 1977 and 1990 Florida SLE epidemics both 
started in Indian River County and then spread throughout 
the Florida peninsula (7). The temporal shift from urban 
to rural epidemic transmission in Florida was facilitated 
by changes in Cx. nigripalpus oviposition preference and 
behavior. The Cx. nigripalpus mosquito is a widespread 
subtropical species and a highly opportunistic blood feeder 
that oviposits in freshly flooded temporary aquatic habitats. 
In urban habitats, Cx. nigripalpus mosquitoes oviposit in 
wastewater retention ponds and open wastewater outflow 
ditches (10). The shift to rural transmission in 1977 and 
1990 was facilitated by an increase in citrus farming, as cit­
rus groves were designed to be maintained by flood irriga­
tion (10). In the 1970s through the 1990s, rural citrus grove 
drainage furrows became the preferred oviposition site for 
Cx. nigripalpus mosquitoes (11). The proclivity of Cx. 
nigripalpus mosquitoes to blood-feed on birds as well as 
mammals and the tendency of females to delay oviposition

until the proper aquatic oviposition habitats are created 
by heavy summer rainfalls make it an excellent vector of 
SLEV (11).
The introduction of WNV into the United States in 
1999 promoted debate about how the presence of WNV 
would affect the continued transmission of SLEV, given 
the serologic cross-reactivity of the 2 viruses in avian 
hosts. Laboratory studies demonstrated that house finches 
(Haemorhous mexicanus) experimentally infected with 
WNV developed neutralizing immunity that prevented 
infection after rechallenge with WNV or SLEV (12). In 
contrast, house finches first exposed to SLEV showed low­
er subsequent viremias after rechallenge with WNV. This 
suggests that WNV could competitively exclude SLEV 
from amplification in shared avian hosts like house finches 
(13). Indeed, transmission of SLEV in Florida decreased 
notably following the introduction and establishment of 
WNV (13). For competitive exclusion to suppress SLEV 
transmission, considerable host overlap between SLEV and 
WNV must occur. In Florida, avian species in the families

 Reemergence of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus 
Cardinalidae (northern cardinal, Cardinalis cardinalis), 
Columbidae (mourning dove, Zenaida macroura), Corvi­
dae (blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), and Icteridae (common 
grackle, Quiscalus quiscula) are frequently exposed to 
SLEV (14). For WNV, house sparrows (Passer domesti­
cus) and blue jays are highly infectious to mosquitoes; in 
contrast, mourning doves were found to be 1 of the least 
competent WNV hosts of 25 bird species examined ex­
perimentally (15). Even if mourning doves are poor WNV 
hosts, being exposed to WNV may provide cross neutral­
ization to SLEV and preempt amplification of SLEV, pro­
vided that doves are exposed to WNV early in the transmis­
sion season. In California, sparrows, finches, and corvids 
(house finch, house sparrow, purple finch [Haemorhous 
purpureus]); song sparrow (Melospiza melodia); western 
scrub jay (Aphelocoma californica); and white-crowned 
sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) are considered major 
amplifying hosts of WNV and SLEV (1,16). As in Florida, 
host overlap of WNV and SLEV likely contributed to the 
initial disappearance of SLEV from the western United 
States (17). Of these avian hosts, only house sparrows, 
house finches, American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), 
and western scrub jays were found to be amplifying hosts 
capable of developing viremias above the threshold for in­
fection of Cx. tarsalis, the principal vector of WNV and 
SLEV throughout much of California (16). Further work 
is needed to characterize the specific avian hosts fed on by 
Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes 
in epidemic and nonepidemic settings to determine whether 
additional host species may be involved in amplification of 
SLEV and to what degree host overlap contributes to the 
competitive exclusion or reemergence of SLEV in areas of 
the United States outside California.
Since the introduction of WNV into the United States, 
human SLE cases continue to occur throughout the coun­
try. During 2004–2013, 92 clinical SLE cases were report­
ed (18). Most cases were located in the Gulf Coast states of 
Louisiana (10 cases), Mississippi (13 cases), and Texas (16 
cases). During 2014–2016, a total of 32 human SLE cases 
were reported (19). Most of these cases were reported in 
the Phoenix area, where a SLE epidemic resulted in 23 con­
firmed human cases, including 1 fatality (19). SLEV has 
remained endemic throughout much of the United States 
despite the introduction and establishment of WNV.
Emergence and Reemergence in South America
Historically, SLEV has not been considered a major public 
health threat in the Americas, other than in the United States. 
Human SLE cases have been reported sporadically through­
out Latin America, but no human epidemics were reported 
until 2005. In Argentina, Charosky et al. (20) reported a neu­
rologic human SLEV case in 1968. Two years later, Mettler 
et al. (21) isolated SLEV from a febrile human suspected 
to have Argentinean hemorrhagic fever. Human encephali­
tis cases were reported sporadically until 2005, when an un­
precedented outbreak of SLE was reported in Córdoba City, 
Argentina (22). During this outbreak, signs and symptoms 
associated with a neurologic infection, including headache, 
sensory depression, temporal–spatial disorientation, tremors, 
and changes in consciousness, were reported. A correlation 
between age and sign or symptom severity was detected 
(Spearman coefficient  =  0.74) (22). The frequency of en­
cephalomyelitis varied from 80% of the cases in patients <20 
years of age to 95% in those >60 years of age (22). A total of 
47 probable and confirmed human cases were reported. Of 
these, 45 patients were hospitalized; 9 died, 1 25 years of age 
and 8 >50 years of age (22).
The SLEV strains CbaAr-4006 and CbaAr-4006 were 
isolated from Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes 
collected during the outbreak in the backyard of the index 
case-patient in Córdoba City (23). Molecular classification 
and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the strains isolated 
during the outbreak were closely related to a genotype III 
SLEV strain (79V-2533) that had been isolated in Santa Fe 
Province, Argentina (23). A 3-year retrospective phyloge­
netic analysis of SLEV genomes from mosquitoes collect­
ed in Córdoba City, designed to find an enzootic progenitor 
of the outbreak strains, indicated no circulation of genotype 
III before the 2005 outbreak (24). The extensive sampling 
effort detected low levels of SLEV transmission of geno­
types other than genotype III. The CbaAr-4005 strain was 
more virulent and produced higher viremias in avian and 
murine models. In house sparrows, CbaAr-4005 produced 
viremias that were 2.2 logs higher and lasted for 2 days lon­
ger than its closest relative, the 1978 79V-2533 strain. Be­
cause mosquitoes show a dose response to infection, house 
sparrows inoculated with SLEV strain CbaAr-4005 will 
theoretically produce viremia sufficient to infect 10 times 
more mosquitoes than those inoculated with a nonepidemic 
strain (25).
In adult Swiss mice, the CbaAr-4005 strain of SLEV 
resulted in 100% (10/10) illness and death compared with 
sympatric nonepidemic SLEV strains isolated previously 
in Córdoba and Santa Fe Province, Argentina (26). Inocu­
lation of only 1 plaque-forming unit in 10-day-old mice 
or 2 plaque-forming units in 21-day-old mice caused a 
50% death rate with the strain CbaAr-4005 (lethal dose 50 
[LD50] in 10-day-old mice = 0.02), proving it to be the most 
lethal strain compared in the study (78V-6507LD50 = 1.75; 
CorAn-9275LD50  =  3.90). That evidence supports the hy­
pothesis that a more virulent SLEV strain was introduced 
into Córdoba City in early 2005 from Santa Fe (Argenti­
na) or São Paulo (Brazil) (Figure 2). Serologic studies of 
wild birds sampled before and during the 2005 outbreak 
indicated that 99% (434/437) of the avian population 
lacked a SLEV-neutralizing antibody and were therefore

SYNOPSIS
susceptible to infection with SLEV, potentially serving as 
amplification hosts (27). The absence of natural immunity 
in the wild avian population may have promoted the 2005 
SLE outbreak in Córdoba City. A host competence study in 
avian species showed that the eared dove (Zenaida auricu­
lata) and picui ground-dove (Columbina picui) produce 
high levels of viremia compared with other avian species 
tested (28). Moreover, that study confirmed the role as am­
plifying host of these 2 dove species during the 2005 SLEV 
outbreak in Córdoba. Additional studies indicate that the 
population of eared doves has been increasing in the central 
region of Argentina during the past 10 years because of 
agricultural geographic expansion (29).
After the 2005 outbreak, additional SLE outbreaks 
in Argentina occurred in Parana (2006), Buenos Aires 
(2010), and San Juan (2011) (Pan American Health Or­
ganization, http://www.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2010/
alert_ epi_2010_31_marz_encefalitis_san_luis.pdf), but 
no ecologic studies focused on these outbreaks. Phyloge­
netic analysis of SLEV genomes associated with human 
cases in Buenos Aires confirmed the presence of SLEV 
genotype III (30).
SLE was diagnosed in a febrile human in São Paulo 
State, Brazil, in 2004, by viral isolation and molecular 
detection (31). Molecular characterization classified the 
isolate as SLEV genotype III. During a dengue virus out­
break in São José do Rio Preto (São Paulo State, Brazil) 
in 2006, Mondini et al. (32) reported the first outbreak of 
SLE in Brazil. Human cases were diagnosed by molecular 
detection of SLEV RNA in serum or cerebrospinal fluid. 
All SLEV-infected patients (6) had an initial diagnosis of 
dengue fever or viral encephalitis; 3 cases were diagnosed 
as viral meningoencephalitis, and the other 3 patients had 
signs of hemorrhagic disease (32). This finding was the

a constant-size coalescent tree before the phylogeny and a TNF93 nt substitution model. The Monte Carlo Markov chain model was 
obtained after 30 million iterations and subsampling every 20.000 iterations. Analyses were made using Beast version 1.8.3 software

first reported link of SLE infection and human hemorrhag­
ic disease (32). A blastn analysis (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi) comparing genomes of different SLEV 
strains, which we carried out for this review, indicates that 
the SLEV strains from Brazil are closely related to SLEV 
genotype V. This finding indicates that genotype V SLEV 
strains are also pathogenic for humans, as shown in pre­
vious studies in murine models (26). Because genotype V 
strains are widespread in South America, human SLEV 
cases could be misdiagnosed as dengue virus infection. A 
detailed analysis of South America human SLE cases is 
shown in Figure 1.
Reemergence in Western United States
SLEV was recognized in 1937 in California; cases were 
documented during 1940–1950 and in Kern County 
during a 1952 outbreak of Western equine encepha­
litis virus (33). SLEV caused periodic epidemics in 
humans and epizootics in equines during the 1950s–
1990s. However, expansive epidemics similar to those 
observed in Missouri and Texas were not detected in 
California, although concurrent activity in mosquitoes 
and seroconversions in birds were repeatedly docu­
mented in the San Joaquin Valley, Los Angeles Basin, 
and Imperial Valley (1,34–36). An outbreak resulting 
in 26 human cases occurred in 1984 in Los Angeles, 
(34), leading to avian studies (37), vector competence 
experiments (38), and vectoral capacity studies (39). 
A SLEV serosurvey following the Los Angeles out­
break found that 1.6% of 1,803 serum samples tested 
from residents of Los Angeles were seropositive. A 
subsequent outbreak of 26 confirmed SLEV cases was 
centered in Kern County but disappeared the follow­
ing summer (35,36). Envelope gene sequencing from 
mosquito isolates suggested that different SLEV strains 
were most likely responsible for these outbreaks (40). 
Sequencing of longitudinal SLEV isolates from Cali­
fornia showed that isolates were genetically similar 
from 1952 through the 1970s, after which genetic 
changes were observed (41).
Even in the absence of epidemics since 1989, SLEV 
activity was documented continuously in California 
from the 1990s through 2003 by human cases, detections 
in mosquitoes, or seroconversions in sentinel chickens 
(42). In 2003, WNV activity was first detected in the 
state (17). During 2003–2015, no SLEV activity was de­
tected in California, despite ongoing SLEV surveillance 
in Culex mosquitoes and sentinel chicken seroconver­
sions (17). The absence of SLEV activity during that 
period was likely not the result of a lack of surveillance 
because the invasion of WNV led to a ≈6-fold statewide 
increase in mosquito pool testing, from ≈5,000 pools 
in 2003 to 30,000–35,000 pools annually since 2007. 
Instead, the absence of SLEV activity suggested extirpa­
tion from California.
Beginning in July 2015, SLEV activity was detect­
ed by the presence of viral RNA in mosquito pools and 
sentinel chicken seroconversions in the Coachella Val­
ley of Riverside County, California (43). In 2016, SLEV 
spread northward to 6 additional counties in California 
(44); in 2017, a total of 15 California counties reported 
activity (45). A clinical study used unbiased clinical 
testing by metagenomic next-generation sequencing to 
diagnose a fatal case of meningoencephalitis from SLEV 
in a patient from Kern County, California, in September 
2016 (46).
In Arizona, SLEV detection was historically less 
frequent than in California; low enzootic activity was 
reported most years during 1972–2006 and only a single 
human case during 2010–2014 (47). In Maricopa County 
(which includes Phoenix), a human SLEV outbreak dur­
ing July–October 2015 resulted in 23 confirmed cases 
(48). Three patients in that outbreak were organ trans­
plant recipients who experienced fever, rigors, diarrhea, 
headache, and confusion; all developed meningoen­
cephalitis, and 1 patient died (48). SLEV infection in 
the 2 surviving transfusion recipients was confirmed by 
plaque reduction neutralization tests (48). Retrospective 
testing of archived mosquito pools from Phoenix col­
lected in 2014 revealed a single SLEV isolate, indicating 
that SLEV was present in Arizona the summer before the 
2015 outbreak (48).
To define the genetic relatedness of reemerging SLEV 
from Arizona and California to SLEV from elsewhere to 
infer a possible origin and pattern of spread, we performed 
phylogenetic analyses of genomes from mosquitoes in 
2014–2016 and the fatal case in 2016 in Kern County. The 
2014 and 2015 California and Arizona SLEV isolates share 
>99% nucleotide identity with each other and also with 
their closest published relative isolated from Cx. pipiens 
quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected in the 2005 epi­
demic in Córdoba City (49). The SLEV genome sequence 
from the fatal case in Kern County from September 2016 
was >99% identical with 2014–2015 SLEV isolates from 
mosquitoes in California and Arizona, suggesting that the 
patient was infected by the reemergent genotype circulat­
ing in the southwestern United States (46). The 2014 and 
2015 SLEV isolates are genetically distinct from the 2003 
Imperial Valley, California, strain that was isolated before 
the 11-year absence of SLEV activity in the state (49). 
These results suggest there was likely a single introduction 
of SLEV into the United States from South America, and 
possibly Argentina, no later than November 2014, the earli­
est dated sample from which SLEV was isolated in Arizona 
and that the virus spread in the summer of 2015 from Ari­
zona to California (49).

SYNOPSIS
Conclusion and Future Perspectives
Arthropodborne virus infections are emerging and re­
emerging infectious diseases worldwide. Mosquitoborne 
viruses, including dengue (emerged in 1990), WNV 
(emerged in 1999), chikungunya (2013), and Zika vi­
ruses (2015), have emerged as public health threats 
in the Western Hemisphere. SLEV is maintained in a 
bird–mosquito transmission network involving multiple 
species in a broad range of ecosystems encompassing a 
wide geographic distribution that ranges from southern 
Canada to southern Argentina. Biotic factors, including 
vector and host abundance and population age structure, 
as well as abiotic factors, including rainfall and drought 
dynamics and elevated summer temperatures, combine 
to produce conditions favorable for transmission of 
SLEV. A better understanding of how SLEV circulates 
between enzootic transmission cycles in nature and epi­
demic transmission in human populations is needed to 
more accurately predict where and when human SLEV 
epidemics will emerge.
The reemergence of SLEV in central Argentina is 
associated with several factors, including the recent in­
troduction of a more virulent strain of SLEV into a na­
ive bird community and increased populations of eared 
doves, a highly susceptible amplification species in 
Argentina. Argentina has experienced intense land use 
changes primarily because of the expansion of agricul­
tural and urbanized habitats. More research is needed 
to define the effects of environmental change on avian 
reservoir and vector populations to clarify the dynam­
ics of SLEV transmission, introduction, reintroduction, 
and reemergence in susceptible habitats throughout the 
Western Hemisphere.
The reemergence of SLEV in California and Arizona 
resulted from introduction of a South American strain of 
SLEV. The genetic diversity of SLEV in the Americas is 
spatially influenced, with wide genetic variation across the 
space, but some SLEV strains from North and South Amer­
ica show high genetic similarity, indicating long-range 
dispersal. Similar to WNV, long-range SLEV dispersal is 
likely mediated by migrating SLEV-infected birds. A bet­
ter understanding of SLEV in wild birds and avian host mi­
gration patterns is necessary to predict the spread of SLEV.

Orthohantaviruses are a group of rodentborne viruses with 
a worldwide distribution. The orthohantavirus Seoul virus 
(SEOV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome 
in humans and is distributed worldwide, like its reservoir host, 
the rat. Cases of SEOV in wild and pet rats have been de­
scribed in several countries, and human cases have been 
reported in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and the 
United States. In the Netherlands, SEOV has previously been 
found in wild brown rats. We describe an autochthonous hu­
man case of SEOV infection in the Netherlands. This patient 
had nonspecific clinical symptoms of an orthohantavirus infec­
tion (gastrointestinal symptoms and distinct elevation of liver 
enzymes). Subsequent source investigation revealed 2 po­
tential sources, the patient’s feeder rats and a feeder rat farm. 
At both sources, a high prevalence of SEOV was found in the 
rats. The virus closely resembled the Cherwell and Turckheim 
SEOV strains that were previously found in Europe.
O
rthohantaviruses are a family of rodentborne viruses 
with a worldwide distribution. Human infection can 
occur when virus-contaminated aerosols of rodent excreta 
are inhaled while entering or cleaning rodent-infested ar­
eas (1). Infection can also be transmitted by rodent bites or 
when orthohantavirus contaminated materials are directly 
introduced into broken skin or conjunctiva. The clinical 
syndromes that are associated with severe disease are hem­
orrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and orthohanta­
virus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). HFRS cases are 
found in large parts of Europe and Asia, whereas HCPS cas­
es are found in North America and South America (2). The 
orthohantavirus Seoul virus (SEOV) causes HFRS of me­
dium severity and was originally found in Asia. In Europe, 
cases of SEOV in wild and pet rats have been described 
in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, and France 
(3–6). Additional outbreaks have been reported in Canada 
and the United States (7). The first non–laboratory-related 
human infections with SEOV in Europe were reported in 
the United Kingdom and France in 2012, although retro­
spectively earlier cases might have occurred (8–10). From 
2013 on, multiple additional human cases were reported in 
the United Kingdom and France (3,11,12). In the United 
States, domestic cases of HFRS attributable to SEOV have 
been described since 1994 (13). In the Netherlands, SEOV 
has been reported in wild rats (14,15). In this article, we 
describe an autochthonous human case of SEOV infection 
in the Netherlands and the subsequent source investigation.
Case Description
In September 2016, a 28-year-old man sought medical care 
at Rijnstate Hospital (Arnhem, the Netherlands); he report­
ed having fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea 
of 7 days’ duration. He had a history of gamma-hydroxubu­
tyrate (GHB) addiction and tobacco use (10 cigarettes/d). 
He denied drinking alcohol. He had no history of travel. 
The patient mentioned that he had been bitten regularly 
while handling live rats at his work at a rat breeding farm 
and by live rats that he kept for his reptiles at home. He 
also mentioned he had been swimming in the Rhine River, 
in which rats can be found. Physical examination revealed 
a sweating, obese, ill patient with normal blood pressure, 
tachycardia (113 beats/min), and a temperature of 38.6°C. 
No abnormalities on auscultation of heart and lungs or 
lymphadenopathy were found. Abdominal examination 
revealed a painful enlarged liver. No abnormalities of the 
skin were recorded. We have summarized the patient’s 
laboratory test results (Table 1). Ultrasound revealed nor­
mal aspect of liver and gall bladder and a slightly enlarged 
spleen (17.2 cm). The patient was hospitalized with an 
initial diagnosis of gastroenteritis, colitis, or leptospirosis. 
Antibiotic treatment with cefuroxime, metronidazole, and 
doxycycline was started. Blood cultures remained negative. 
A serum sample from the patient, taken at admission, tested

SYNOPSIS
 Human Seoul Virus Infection, the Netherlands
negative for hepatitis A, B C, and E viruses; HIV; Trepo­
nema pallidum (syphilis); cytomegalovirus; Epstein-Barr 
virus; and Leptospira spp. The patient did not have signs of 
acute kidney injury and showed only a mild proteinuria of 
0.25 g/L in a single urine sample. He was tested for ortho­
hantavirus infection because he mentioned that he was bitten 
by rats regularly. The father of the patient, who took care of 
the reptiles occasionally, and the patient’s partner, who did 
not have any contact with the reptiles, were not feeling ill.
Material and Methods
Human SEOV Diagnostics
For detection of hantavirus IgG and IgM, we used an im­
munofluorescent assay (IFA) with mosaic slides containing 
SEOV and other orthohantaviruses Puumala virus, Sin Nom­
bre virus, Hantaan virus, Dobrava-Belgrade virus, and Saa­
remaa virus (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany), according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions (16). The titer was defined as 
the last sample dilution for which the fluorescence was iden­
tifiable, and a titer >1:32 was considered positive. Serum 
samples of the patient and 2 close contacts were tested for 
hantavirus antibodies. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 
patient serum by using the MagNAPure 96 system (Roche, 
Basel, Switzerland) and tested for SEOV RNA by using a 
hantavirus genus–specific real-time reverse transcription 
PCR (rRT-PCR), as described by Kramski et al. (17).
Investigation of Feeder Rats Owned by the Patient
Because the patient kept feeder rats at home and these 
rats are a known source of SEOV infection, the rats were 
collected for source investigation. At the time of investi­
gation, the patient had 5 live and 5 frozen feeder rats at 
home. The rats were housed in a domestic residence and 
were 7–13 months old. All likely originated from a feed­
er rat breeding farm, where the patient worked regularly 
as a volunteer, although the patient gave contradicting 
information about this. All available rats were tested for 
SEOV virus. The 5 live rats were euthanized, and serum and 
lung tissues were collected. For the frozen rats, serum was 
collected by vortexing and centrifugation of the rat hearts, 
as described previously (15). Antibodies in rat serum were 
detected by using a human SEOV ELISA (Hantavirus Do­
brava/Hantaan IgG Elisa; Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Hei­
delberg, Germany), which was adapted to enable detection 
of IgG in rats. Rabbit-α-rat horseradish peroxidase-labeled 
IgG (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie B.V., Zwijndrecht, the Neth­
erlands) was used as conjugate at a 1:5,000 dilution. A cut­
off value was based on the average OD of negative control 
rat serum + 3 × SD (in this case, a value of 0.2–0.3).
For euthanized and frozen rats, lung tissue was col­
lected in RNAlater (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, 
USA) and stored at −80°C. Lung tissue was disrupted in 
MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer (Roche) by using 
Lysis matrix D (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) 
and Fast Prep FP120 homogenizer (Thermo Savant, Carls­
bad, CA, USA). Total nucleic acid was isolated by auto­
mated nucleic acid extraction by using the MagNA Pure 
96 system (Roche). As a first screening, a hantavirus ge­
nus–specific rRT-PCR was performed on lung tissue, as 
described previously. Subsequently, a selection of the sam­
ples was confirmed with a nested rRT-PCR assay of the 
large (L) segment, as described by Klempa et al. (18). The 
resulting fragments were purified with ExoSAP-IT PCR 
clean-up (Isogen Life Science, Utrecht, the Netherlands) 
and sequenced by Baseclear (Leiden, the Netherlands). For 
clarity, details of the selection of rats and the subsequent 
experimental procedures are summarized in Figure 1.
Investigation of Rats from the Feeder Rat Breeding Farm
The feeder rats from the patient’s home likely originated 
from the feeder rat breeding farm where the patient vol­
unteered. At the time of the investigation, the feeder rat 
breeding farm housed 8,000–9,000 rats, 7 rabbits, and ap­
proximately 30 gerbils, 100 mice, and 60 snakes (constric­
tors). Adult rats at the farm were housed in 40 open boxes 
that measured 1 m × 1 m. About 30 rats were kept per box, 
of which ≈5–10 were male and 20–25 were female. Smaller 
boxes were available for pregnant female rats, female rats 
with pups, and juvenile rats.

SYNOPSIS
Sixty rats, of which 40 were adults (age 7–13 months) 
and 20 were juveniles (age 4–6 weeks), were collected. One 
adult rat per box was picked randomly out of each box for 
this study. Five juvenile rats were collected randomly from 
4 different boxes that contained the juvenile rats. When 
handling the rats, researchers used face masks (protective 
class FFP-2), disposable gloves, and coveralls. Serum and 
lung samples of the adults and juveniles were collected and 
analyzed as described previously.
The owner of the rat farm did not keep a record of where 
he bought and sold his rats. He reported that he regularly sold 
rats to several feeder rat breeding farms within the Nether­
lands. These farms were subsequently contacted, but their 
management would not cooperate with the investigation.
Sequencing
From 1 rat owned by the patient and 1 rat from the breeding 
farm, the complete SEOV genome (i.e., the small, medium 
[M], and L segments) was sequenced. Primers were devel­
oped based on published sequences and are available on 
request. All fragments were purified with ExoSAP-IT PCR 
clean-up (Isogen Life Science) and sequenced by Baseclear.
Results
Patient and Close Contacts
Testing found high antibody titers to the orthohantaviruses, 
especially SEOV, in the patient. The patient improved in 4 
days, platelet count and liver enzyme test improved, and he 
was discharged. A second serum sample for detection of an­
tibodies to orthohantaviruses was taken 3 weeks later when 
the patient had made a full recovery.
The patient was found to be positive in the orthohan­
tavirus IFA with the highest IgG and IgM titers to SEOV 
(Table 2). Orthohantavirus RNA was not detected in the 
serum sample. Two close contacts of the patient tested neg­
ative in serologic testing for orthohantaviruses. The first 
close contact was the father of the index patient. While the 
index patient was hospitalized, his father had fed several 
rats to the reptiles. The second close contact was the cohab­
iting partner of the index patient and reported no contact 
with the rats.
Feeder Rats from Patient
Of the 10 rats collected from the patient’s home, 6 (2/5 
fresh and 4/5 frozen) rats were found positive by serologic 
testing and rRT-PCR (Table 3). All 5 fresh rats were tested 
in the nested rRT-PCR assay of the L segment, and again, 
the same 2 rats were positive.
Feeder Rats Breeding Farm
Of 60 rats purchased from the rat breeding farm, 4 juveniles 
died from poor condition before they could be euthanized. 
The remaining 40 adults and 16 juveniles were tested using 
ELISA and rRT-PCR. All 40 adult rats were seropositive 
for orthohantaviruses. Lung tissues of all adult rats tested

positive for SEOV RNA by rRT-PCR. A selection of 5 
adult rats was tested with the nested rRT-PCR assay of the 
L segment, and all 5 rats were positive.
Of the juveniles, 1 of the 16 was found to be sero­
positive. However, all 16 were orthohantavirus negative by 
rRT-PCR on lung tissues (Table 3).
Sequencing
The 7 SEOV-positive rats (2 from the patient and 5 from 
the rat breeding farm) tested by nested rRT-PCR showed 
identical sequences of the L segment. The complete SEOV 
genome was sequenced from 1 of the patient’s rats and 1 
breeding farm rat. Sequences were submitted to GenBank 
(accession nos. MG764078–83). The phylogenetic tree of 
the small segments (Figure 2) shows the strains are 100% 
identical. Furthermore, these strains are 100% identical to 
the Turckheim strain isolated from pet rats in France (11) 
and 99.6% identical to the Cherwell strain (3) isolated from 
pet rats in the United Kingdom. Also, the M segment were 
identical to each other and 99.8% identical to the Cherwell 
strain. The L segment was 99.6% identical to the Cherwell 
strain. The sequence of the M and L segments of the Turck­
heim strain were not available for comparison.
Discussion 
SEOV was detected in wild brown rats in the Netherlands 
in 2013, but no human cases had been reported. In this 
article, we report an autochthonous case of SEOV infec­
tion in the Netherlands. The case-patient had nonspecific 
clinical symptoms of an orthohantavirus infection, show­
ing gastrointestinal symptoms and distinct elevation of 
liver enzymes. Although the patient did not develop acute 
kidney injury, we found mild proteinuria and thrombocyto­
penia, which might also be found in SEOV infection. Be­
cause SEOV infections are related to a mild form of HFRS, 
with low incidence of hemorrhagic manifestations and low 
mortality rates, previous cases might have been missed or 
misdiagnosed as viral infection or gastroenteritis. Elevation 
of liver enzymes has been reported to occur to a greater 
extent in SEOV infections but in this patient might have 
been attributable to use of medication (acetaminophen) or 
gamma-hydroxubutyrate. Diagnosis of HFRS attributable 
to SEOV infection is largely based on serologic testing.
The patient had high SEOV IgG and IgM titers 
(1:16,384 for IgG and 1:4,096 for IgM) by IFA. Cross-reac­
tions exist within 2 defined serogroups of orthohantaviruses 
but are limited between the serogroups. Antibodies against 
Puumala virus and Sin Nombre virus cross-react, whereas 
SEOV as member of the other serogroup cross-reacts with 
Hantaan virus, Dobrava-Belgrade virus, and Saaremaa vi­
rus. This investigation found a clear link from the patient 
to the SEOV-infected rats at home and at the breeder farm. 
Combined with the high antibody titers against SEOV, we 
concluded that the patient’s positive IFA result was due to 
a recent SEOV infection.
The patient’s rats probably originated from the breed­
ing farm where the patient worked as a volunteer, which is 
also suggested by the sequence results. Management at the 
farm facilitated spread of SEOV by frequently moving rats 
from one box to the other and randomly returning female 
rats to boxes after they had weaned their pups. No regis­
tration of these movements was recorded. The tested rats

SYNOPSIS
were in a poor body condition, and many had bite wounds 
on their ears, providing ideal transmission conditions for 
SEOV (19). Several health risks (including public health 
risks) were identified with regard to the SEOV-positive 
feeder rat breeding farm, including the possibility of infec­
tion of personnel and visitors to the farm and the potential 
spread of the pathogen by regular trade and exchange with 
other feeder rat breeding farms and occasionally with un­
known parties, possibly including pet stores. Also, SEOV 
might spread from the feeder rats to wild rats living around 
the farm through direct contact or through contaminated 
materials (e.g., bedding material). Anyone entering the 
breeding farm was advised to wear disposable gloves, shoe 
sleeves, an apron, and a face mask (protective class FFP-2) 
and to wash their hands immediately after leaving the barn. 
They were also warned to avoid being bitten by the rats. All 
employees and volunteers were offered a blood test to see 
if they had been infected; no one accepted. Anyone buying 
or otherwise taking rats from the breeding farm was given 
a letter, signed by the Municipal Health Services, inform­
ing them of the possibility of the rats being infected. Pest 
control measures were set up, preventing contact of wild 
rats with feeder rats. The distribution of the used sawdust 
over nearby farm lands was discontinued. Used sawdust 
was thereafter brought to the municipal facility to be burnt 
in a waste disposal facility. By law in the Netherlands, 
notification of orthohantavirus infection in humans is 
mandatory but not in animals. Therefore, no legislation 
on control measures (e.g., enforced quarantine of infected 
animals, a ban on selling rats, or a forced closure of the 
breeding farm) was in effect. These limitations complicated 
source investigation because testing of the breeder rat farm 
was based on voluntary cooperation of the farm owner; they 
also severely complicated our efforts to contain this virus.
Duggan et al. showed that the seroprevalence of an­
tibodies to SEOV in persons with a high contact rate with 
rats, such as rat owners, is 34%, compared with 3% in con­
trols with occupational exposure to pet fancy rats or wild 
rats (12). Naturally, this probability depends on the spread 
of SEOV in the domestic rat populations in the Nether­
lands. To what extent SEOV is present in rat populations in 
the Netherlands is unknown. Hantavirus-infected rodents 
do not show any overt symptoms and might spread ortho­
hantavirus for a prolonged period, possibly lifelong (20–
23). However, the presence in feeder rats and anecdotal 
information about exchange between rat populations sug­
gest that SEOV might be present in captive rat populations 
in the Netherlands. Also, exchange of pet and feeder rats 
between countries in Europe might be extensive, which is 
supported by the close resemblance of the SEOV strain in 
the Netherlands to the Cherwell strain in the United King­
dom and the Turckheim strain in France. In Europe, SEOV

 Human Seoul Virus Infection, the Netherlands
has been detected in pet rats in England and Wales (13), 
Sweden (5), and France (11).
This case illustrates the importance of clinical aware­
ness for orthohantavirus infections after contact with ro­
dents, including in patients with nonspecific symptoms, 
and the challenges that arise when source investigation and 
implementation of control measures are hampered by lack 
of legislation. The source investigation and implementation 
of control measures required multidisciplinary, constructive 
cooperation between research institutions and authorities. 
Future studies to assess the extent of SEOV infection in the 
domestic rat populations in the Netherlands are needed to 
inform the general public concerning the risk for contracting 
this virus by handling rats and the related health risks.

Rates of Salmonella infection in the United States have not 
changed over the past 20 years. Restaurants are frequent 
settings for Salmonella outbreaks and sporadic infections. 
Few studies have examined the effect of posting letter 
grades for restaurant inspections on the incidence of food­
borne illness. We compared Salmonella infection rates in 
New York, New York, USA (NYC), with those in the rest of 
New York state before and after implementation of a letter 
grade system for restaurant inspections in NYC. We calcu­
lated a segmented regression model for interrupted time se­
ries data. After implementation of letter grading, the rate of 
Salmonella infections decreased 5.3% per year in NYC ver­
sus the rest of New York state during 2011–2015, compared 
with the period before implementation, 2006–2010. Posting 
restaurant inspection results as letter grades at the point of 
service was associated with a decline in Salmonella infec­
tions in NYC and warrants consideration for broader use.
E
ach year, an estimated 48 million persons get sick, 
128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne 
illness in the United States (1). Consumption of food pre­
pared away from home, such as at restaurants and for take­
out, has continuously increased, accounting for 50% of food 
expenditures in 2014, up from 33% in 1970 (2). Restaurants 
are frequent settings for transmission of foodborne illness; in 
2015, 60% of foodborne illness outbreaks were associated 
with restaurants (3). There is also evidence that commercial 
food service establishments, such as restaurants, play a role 
in sporadic (nonoutbreak) cases of foodborne illness (4). 
Given our dependence on food prepared away from home, 
reducing the risk for foodborne illness from commercial 
food service establishments is of critical importance.
Food service establishments play a role in the epidemi­
ology of Salmonella infections; Salmonella may contami­
nate a wide range of raw ingredients, infect food workers, 
survive on contaminated surfaces, and grow in improperly 
held food items. Nontyphoidal Salmonella infections are 
the second most common foodborne illness and the leading 
cause of foodborne illness hospitalizations and death (1). 
Reducing Salmonella infections is a Healthy People 2020 
objective (5), yet rates have not substantially changed over 
the last 20 years (6). Inspection of food service establish­
ments to protect food safety is a core function of state and 
local health departments; the inspections help to identify 
risk factors for foodborne illness, such as those associated 
with Salmonella transmission, and to correct them, thus 
protecting consumers and industry.
New York does not have a statewide policy for report­
ing restaurant inspection results. In 2005, the Department 
of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) in New York, 
NY, USA (NYC), began using a point-scoring system for 
food service establishment inspections to weight violations 
to reflect risk factors for foodborne illness. In 2010, the 
NYC DOHMH implemented a letter grade program that 
converted these scores into categorical rankings of A, B, 
or C, or grade pending, in an effort to improve restaurant 
food safety, increase transparency of inspection informa­
tion, and reduce the risk for foodborne illness transmission 
in restaurants (7). The DOHMH required establishments 
to post a sign with the letter grade in its window so that 
consumers could see it before entering. Public disclosure 
programs like this one seek to provide information to con­
sumers when and where they need it so they can make in­
formed decisions about potential risks (8). These consumer 
decisions encourage restaurant operators to improve and 
maintain sanitary standards, thus improving sanitary con­
ditions in restaurants. The letter grade program has already 
been shown to lead to improvements in sanitary conditions 
in NYC: 35% more restaurants earned A grades in the 3 
years after grading, compared with the 3 years before (9).
The value of posting restaurant inspection ratings at 
the point of service has been the subject of considerable de­
bate. Few studies have looked at the impact of posting poli­
cies on the incidence of foodborne illness. Two studies of 
a letter grade program in Los Angeles County, California, 
USA, showed a reduction in foodborne-illness hospitaliza­
tions (10,11). In NYC, a preliminary analysis of letter grad­
ing at 18 months suggested a decline in Salmonella infec­
tions. The goal of our study was to compare the incidence 
of Salmonella infections in NYC with incidence in the rest

SYNOPSIS
 Inspection Grades and Salmonella, New York
of the state before and after the implementation of posting 
letter grade placards at the point of service.
Methods
Data
Salmonella infections are nationally notifiable (12). We 
obtained yearly laboratory-confirmed case counts from 
1994–2015 from the NYC DOHMH and the New York 
State Department of Health. Cases are reported by year of 
diagnosis and county of residence.
Statistical Analyses
To account for population changes, we calculated annual 
rates using intercensal population estimates for 1994–2015 
from the US Census Bureau. We calculated the percent 
change from year to year. We compared mean rates of 
Salmonella infection before and after implementation of a 
point scoring system in 2005 and after implementation of 
grade cards in 2010 using t-tests for NYC and the rest of the 
state (NYS). We considered the year of implementation to 
be a part of the before period in both analyses because the 
policies were not implemented on January 1 of each year.
We used segmented regression to determine the trend 
before implementing the policy in Salmonella infections, an 
immediate change at the time of policy implementation, and 
the long-term trend after policy implementation (13). We 
hypothesized that the long-term trend would decline after 
policy implementation. We expected a delayed effect be­
cause restaurants are not all on the same inspection cycle and 
because underlying improvements in sanitation driving the 
decline are not likely to be immediate. Because there were 
indications of overdispersion and heteroskedasticity, we 
used a negative binomial regression model with robust SEs 
to quantify the effect of letter grade placards on Salmonella 
infections. We used an offset term to account for population 
changes across the period. Examination of autocorrelation 
and partial autocorrelation functions confirmed that the out­
come was not autocorrelated. We calculated incidence rate 
ratios (IRR) comparing Salmonella infections in NYC to 
NYS before and after the implementation of the point scor­
ing system and posting of letter grade placards.
Key variables included year, coded as a continuous 
variable starting with 1994 = 1; variables representing the 
2 policy periods (prepolicy = 0, postpolicy = 1); 2 variables 
representing the trends after policy implementation, coded 
as 0 before the policy and a continuous numerical function 
after the policy was implemented; and a variable (region) 
representing NYC versus NYS. The model also included 
5 interaction terms: region by year, to control for regional 
secular trends; region by policy for each policy (before 
and after letter grade was implemented), to account for the 
mean level change in NYC after the new policy took effect; 
and region by trend before and after policy implementation, 
to determine if the average Salmonella infections in NYC 
changed after policy implementation versus NYS (14). We 
also conducted a subanalysis using data from 2000–2015 
to compare NYC to surrounding counties (NYC metropoli­
tan area) and NYS. We analyzed data using Stata version 
14.2 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) and de­
termined statistical significance as p<0.05.
Results
The annual rate of Salmonella infections decreased in both 
NYC and NYS during 1994–2015 (Table 1; Figure). The 
period-to-period percent change after letter grading imple­
mentation was a decline of 32.6% in NYC, compared with a 
decline of 14.1% in NYS (Table 1). Mean Salmonella infec­
tion rates in NYC between 1994 and 2010 were significantly 
higher (p<0.01) than in NYS (Table 2). In the period after 
letter grading was implemented (2011–2015), the mean rate 
of Salmonella infection was no longer significantly differ­
ent (p = 0.37) in NYC (mean 12.6 cases/100,000 persons; 
95% CI 10.9–14.4) compared with NYS (mean 12.0 cas­
es/100,000 persons; 95% CI 11.4–12.6).
In NYC and NYS, Salmonella infections were de­
creasing before either policy was implemented in NYC 
(IRR 0.95; 95% CI 0.94–0.96; p<0.01). The interaction 
term for trend by region after letter grade implementation 
was statistically significant (p<0.01), which indicates that 
Salmonella infection rates declined on average in NYC 
versus NYS in the years after letter grading was imple­
mented, compared with the period after the point scoring 
system was implemented (Table 3). After letter grading 
was implemented, the rate of Salmonella infections de­
creased 5.3% per year in NYC versus NYS (IRR 0.95; 95% 
CI 0.92–0.98; p<0.01).
In a subanalysis of Salmonella infections from 2000–
2015 comparing number of infections in NYC with that of 
other counties in the NYC metropolitan area and NYS sep­
arately, Salmonella infections declined in both NYC and 
the NYC metropolitan area compared with those in NYS. 
In contrast to the findings in NYS, in the period after letter 
grading was implemented, NYC Salmonella infections de­
clined 8.8% per year and Salmonella infections in the NYC 
metropolitan area declined 7.5% per year compared with 
the period between the implementation of a point scoring 
system and the letter grade program.
Discussion
Overall, Salmonella infections declined in NYC and NYS 
between 1994 and 2015. Although NYS had declines in 
Salmonella infection rates after 2010, NYC saw declines 
greater than those in NYS. Inspection processes were 
largely unchanged in NYC with the implementation of 
the point scoring system in 2005 (15). The letter grade

SYNOPSIS
placard program begun in 2010 did not change the point 
scoring system but rather used the points to create a readily 
comprehensible ranking system accessible at the point of 
service. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that having 
a point scoring system was not associated with declines in 
Salmonella infections but having a simple way to publicly 
disclose the results of the inspection was.
Although it appears that the implementation of a point 
scoring system in NYC was associated with a leveling 
off of declines in Salmonella infections, the system was 
implemented at the end of a hyperendemic period of Salmo­
nella enterica serotype Enteriditis infections. In the 1980s, 
high rates of Salmonella Enteriditis infections primarily as­
sociated with shell eggs were recognized, and a variety of 
prevention and control measures were put in place to combat 
these rising rates (16). The Northeast was particularly af­
fected by this outbreak; New York state reported the high­
est number of outbreaks during 1985–1999 (16). Prevention 
measures appeared to have the greatest success in reducing 
rates in the Northeast compared with others (16). Further­
more, 2 notable changes in NYC during this time period led 
to improved surveillance, which typically results in better 
detection and reporting. In 2006, the NYC Board of Health 
mandated electronic laboratory reporting of notifiable diseas­
es (17); in 2009, NYC became a Foodborne Diseases Centers 
for Outbreak Response Enhancement (FoodCORE) center 
with the goal of improving surveillance for Salmonella infec­
tions (18). To the extent that these efforts may have improved 
surveillance in NYC, they may also have been expected to 
increase case detection in NYC versus NYS.
The implementation of letter grading in 2010 marks 
the beginning of the current declining trend in Salmonella 
infections. By improving sanitation conditions in NYC 
food service establishments, the letter grade program can 
be expected to benefit other areas as well. In this study,

 Inspection Grades and Salmonella, New York
Salmonella infection were reported by county of residence, 
but NYC sees its population change daily due to commut­
ing and tourism. Manhattan, one of the 5 NYC boroughs, 
sees its population nearly double during the workday. Of 
its commuters, 36% (≈550,000 persons) travel from outside 
the other 4 boroughs (19). Additionally, NYC is a popu­
lar place for tourists; >60 million persons visited in 2016 
(20). Our study showed that Salmonella infections in NYS 
declined after the letter grade program was implemented. 
This finding may be in part because improved sanitary 
conditions in NYC restaurants after the implementation of 
letter grades reduced risk for Salmonella exposure among 
NYS residents who commuted to or visited NYC.
This study had several limitations. First, this was a 
quasi-experimental, ecologic study that represents an as­
sociation and not a causal relationship. Second, the NYC 
restaurant letter grade program involved multiple changes 
to sanitation enforcement in addition to letter grade post­
ing; changes included inspection frequency, greater risk 
for fines, improvements to online resources, and additional 
training opportunities (21). As a result, we could not deter­
mine which factors contributed the most to the reduction 
in Salmonella infections. Furthermore, we were not able to 
assess whether Salmonella-infected persons had a known 
exposure to restaurants in the period before illness.
This study supports findings from an earlier NYC study 
(21) and previous studies of Los Angeles County that showed 
a decline in foodborne illness hospitalizations. Hospitaliza­
tions represent a subset of foodborne illnesses that may be 
caused by a variety of agents, such as Campylobacter, an­
other leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States 
(1). However, Campylobacter rarely causes outbreaks in 
restaurant settings because its biology limits transmission 
to inadequate cooking of contaminated poultry or meats or 
cross-contamination from raw to ready-to-eat foods (22). As 
a result, improvements in restaurant sanitary conditions are 
unlikely to affect Campylobacter transmission in restaurants.
In contrast, the selection of Salmonella infections is 
a strength of this study because the biology of Salmonella 
makes it uniquely suited for transmission in food service 
establishments. In restaurants, Salmonella can cause illness 
from contaminated raw ingredients, through cross-contam­
ination, or from infected food workers. Improper cooling 
of inadequately cooked foods, or failure to maintain cold or 
hot holding temperatures can amplify contamination. Thus, 
Salmonella transmission serves as a good indicator of over­
all restaurant food safety practices.
Despite limitations, NYC’s experience provides a useful 
case study of the beneficial effect of letter grading programs. 
Although the relationship between restaurant inspections and 
risk for foodborne illness is not well understood (23) and in­
spections represent a snapshot in time that may not represent 
the overall sanitary conditions in restaurants, factors related 
to food handling and preparation practices and food worker 
health and hygiene are frequent contributors to outbreaks in 
restaurants (24). These factors probably contribute to trans­
mission of sporadic infections in restaurants, which are much 
more common; outbreak cases represent <10% of all Salmo­
nella infections (4,6). The NYC restaurant letter grade pro­
gram has been shown to be associated with sustained improve­
ments in sanitary conditions in restaurants, including several 
factors associated with outbreaks (9). Furthermore, that study 
showed that after 18 months, 81% of adults in NYC had seen 
letter grade placards, and 88% of those persons considered 
the letter grades in their dining decisions (9). This finding sug­
gests that consumer behavior helped support the program goal 
of driving improvements in sanitary conditions. Although fu­
ture studies are needed to parse which restaurant inspection 
results may contribute most to declines in Salmonella infec­
tions, our findings support the hypothesis that the successful

SYNOPSIS
implementation of a letter grade program was associated with 
a reduction of Salmonella transmission in restaurants in NYC.
In conclusion, in the United States, considerable re­
sources have been invested to prevent contamination of 
the food supply before the point of service. However, Sal­
monella infections remain unchanged at the national level. 
Previous studies have shown improvements in sanitary 
conditions after the implementation of the NYC restaurant 
letter grade program, and our study suggests a beneficial 
effect on the incidence of foodborne illnesses. Implement­
ing a letter grade program is a feasible and relatively inex­
pensive tool to reduce Salmonella infections that warrants 
consideration for broader use. Other jurisdictions should 
consider adopting a letter grade program and decide on the 
form and location of the placard, frequency of inspections, 
and approaches to engage restaurant-industry and commu­
nity support to ensure program success.

We investigated the spatial epidemiology of bovine tuber­
culosis (TB) in wildlife in a multihost system. We surveyed 
bovine TB in Portugal by serologic analysis of elutes of 
dried blood spots obtained from hunted wild boar. We mod­
eled spatial disease risk by using areal generalized linear 
mixed models with conditional autoregressive priors. Anti­
bodies against Mycobaterium bovis were detected in 2.4% 
(95% CI 1.5%–3.8%) of 678 wild boar in 2 geographic 
clusters, and the predicted risk fits well with independent 
reports of M. bovis culture. Results show that elutes are an 
almost perfect substitute for serum (Cohen unweighted κ 
= 0.818), indicating that serologic tests coupled with dried 
blood spots are an effective strategy for large-scale bovine 
TB surveys, using wild boar as sentinel species. Results 
also show that bovine TB is an emerging wildlife disease 
and stress the need to prevent further geographic spread 
and prevalence increase.
B
ovine tuberculosis (TB) is a zoonotic disease caused 
by Mycobacterium bovis and other members of the M. 
tuberculosis complex, whose natural hosts are wild and do­
mestic mammals (1). Bovine TB is a disease of economic 
and public health relevance and is subjected to mandatory 
control programs in livestock in many countries. As a re­
sult of these programs, bovine TB has been eradicated in 
regions such as Australia and Scandinavia. However, in 
other regions, persistence of infection has been attributed 
to wildlife reservoirs, such as cervids in North America 
(2). In the Iberian Peninsula (Figure 1, panel A), bovine 
TB is maintained in a multihost pathogen system in which 
M. bovis and M. caprae circulate between sympatric wild 
ungulates (mainly wild boar [Sus scrofa] and red deer [Cer­
vus elaphus]) and free-ranging domestic ungulates (1).
In Portugal, control of bovine TB has resulted in a 
low prevalence in livestock (4.5 cases/10,000 cattle and 
2.9 cases/1,000 herds) in 2017 (3). Nevertheless, disease 
incidence has stabilized in recent years, and awareness of 
wildlife hosts has fueled the discussion over their role as 
reservoirs of bovine TB. In 2011, the Portuguese Animal 
Health Directorate (Lisbon, Portugal) established a surveil­
lance area for bovine TB in large game species, encom­
passing regions where the disease was known to be present 
in wild ungulate populations (Figure 1, panel B).
Bovine TB in wildlife shows spatial structuring in the 
Iberian Peninsula. There is a core area in the central–south­
western region, in which the average prevalence of macro­
scopic lesions is 59% in wild boar (4). At the periphery of 
this core area, prevalence decreases, and becomes low to 
undetectable in eastern, northern, and western regions of 
the Iberian Peninsula (5–7). Nevertheless, spatial analyses 
of bovine TB on wildlife in the Iberian Peninsula, other 
than disease mapping, are notably lacking.
Large-scale disease surveys in wildlife require mass-
scalable and inexpensive diagnostic tests; serologic meth­
ods are one of the most suitable techniques (8). An ELISA 
for detecting antibodies against the M. tuberculosis com­
plex has been described and validated for use in wild boar 
(9,10) and showed a moderately high estimated sensitivity 
of 79.2% and an excellent specificity of 100% (10). Anoth­
er improvement for large-scale disease surveys in wildlife 
is a sampling protocol that might be used by nonspecial­
ized personnel, such as hunters. One example is the dried 
blood spot technique, which was originally developed for 
human sampling but has been increasingly used for wildlife 
disease surveys (11).

RESEARCH
Wild boar have been shown to be a maintenance host 
for bovine TB in the Iberian Peninsula (12). Furthermore, 
wild boar have been used as a sentinel for bovine TB in 
wildlife because of their high susceptibility to infection 
with M. bovis and M. caprae and extensive exposure to 
these pathogens through direct contact, necrophagic hab­
its, or fossorial habits (13–15). Wild boar populations in 
Portugal reached their nadir in the middle of the 20th cen­
tury, when the species survived in only 5 populations or 
historical refuges (16,17) (Figure 1, panel B). Since that 
time, wild boar populations have increased markedly and 
are currently found throughout Portugal (16,17).
To assess the spatial epidemiology of bovine TB in 
wildlife, we analyzed the multihost pathogen system in the 
Iberian Peninsula by using the wild boar as a sentinel species. 
The main aims of this study were to assess the performance 
of dried blood spots as an alternative sample collection and 
storage technique for serologic surveys of bovine TB, map 
the distribution of wildlife bovine in Portugal on the basis of 
serologic methods, investigate spatial clustering of bovine 
TB in wildlife, and model the risk for bovine TB in Portugal.
Methods
Collection of Samples
Biological samples were obtained from 678 wild boar hunt­
ed during 2006–2013. Of these samples, 107 were serum and 
571 were dried blood spots collected on Protein Saver (PS) 
903 cards (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) (n = 308) or Flinders 
Technology Associates (FTA) paper (Whatman) (n = 263).
Serum samples were obtained from blood collected 
from the thoracic or abdominal cavities of hunted wild boar 
and stored at –20°C. Absorbent papers were distributed 
to hunters with instructions for the papers to be soaked in 
blood available from the thoracic cavity. Papers were dried 
in the shade and kept at room temperature in zipper-lock

bags with data on the location of collection. Dried blood 
spots were recovered at the end of the hunting season and 
kept at –20°C until processed. Elutes were obtained by 
cutting half a circle of PS card or a quarter of FTA cards. 
According to the manufacturer’s instructions, a PS card ab­
sorbs 80 µL of blood, and an FTA card absorbs 125 µL 
of blood. These samples were further divided into 5 por­
tions that were incubated overnight refrigerated in 200 µL 
of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the elute obtained 
was subjected to serologic analysis. Paired samples of se­
rum and dried blood spots were collected from 22 wild boar 
that had macroscopic lesions compatible with bovine TB.
In 1 region of southeastern Portugal, tissue samples 
were collected from 340 hunted wild boar with either bo­
vine TB–compatible lesions or pooled lymph nodes when 
lesions were absent. These samples were obtained during 
2009–2014 and kept at –20°C until bacteriological cultures 
were performed.
Laboratory Analysis
We tested serum samples by using an ELISA and bovine 
purified protein derivative (bovine PPD) as antigen and pro­
tein G–horseradish peroxidase as conjugate (10). In brief, we 
coated wells of ELISA plates with 100 µg of bovine PPD 
for 18 hours at room temperature, washed the plates with 
PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and incubated the 
plates for 1 hour at 37°C with 140 µL/well of 5% skimmed 
milk in PBST to block potential free binding sites. We added 
serum or elute samples to plates (10 µL/well) at dilutions of 
1:200 in PBS for serum and 1:50 in PBS for elutes and incu­
bated samples for 1 hour at 37°C. Protein G–horseradish per­
oxidase conjugate was added (100 µL/well) at a dilution of 
2.5 µg/mL in PBST and incubated at 37°C for 80 min. A to­
tal of 100 µL of substrate (SigmaFast OPD; Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and incubated 
at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped 
after 20 min by the addition of 50 µL/well of 3N H2SO4. 
We measured optical density (OD) by using a spectro­
photometer at 450 nm. Blanks and positive and negative 
controls were tested in duplicate in each plate, and samples 
were tested in triplicate. Results were calculated as mean 
sample OD divided by 2 times the mean negative control 
OD; the cutoff for positivity was 1 (10).
We prepared bacteriological cultures of tissue samples 
in a Biosafety Level 3 facility according to a described pro­
tocol (18). In brief, 3 g of tissue were homogenized and 
decontaminated for 2 hours with 0.75% hexa-decylpyri­
dinium chloride, centrifuged at 2,566 × g for 30 min, and 
the supernatant collected. We inoculated 2 tubes contain­
ing Coletsos medium (bioMerieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France) 
with 250 µL of supernatant–sediment interface and incu­
bated these tubes at 37°C for 15 wks. Isolates were identi­
fied by PCR for 16S rRNA, insertion sequence 1561, and 
Rv1510 genes after DNA extraction by using the standard 
phenol-chloroform method after bead-beating with 100 
μL of 0.1-mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products, 
Bartlesville, OK, USA) in a FastPrep 24 Homogenizer (MP 
Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA).
Data Analysis
To determine agreement between ELISA results (positive 
or negative) from paired serum and elute samples, we com­
puted the Cohen unweighted κ value (19) by using irr in R 
software (20) (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). 
We obtained serologic data for 92 of 278 counties in Portu­
gal (Figure 1, panel C). The area considered for each county 
excluded regions classified as urban or water bodies in the 
CORINE database (21). We created choropleth maps, which 
use differences in shading, coloring, or placing of symbols 
within predefined areas to indicate average values of a prop­
erty or quantity in those areas, of regions with bovine TB 
and performed spatial interpolation by using QGIS version 
2.6.1 Brighton software (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getin­
volved/governance/governance.html). To detect spatial ag­
gregation of bovine TB, we performed cluster analysis on 
the basis of Kuldorff spatial scan statistics by using the Ber­
noulli distribution and setting the maximum cluster size at 
50% with SatScan version 9.3.1 software (22).
We assessed the association between detection of bo­
vine TB in wild boar in each county and independent vari­
ables (Table 1) by using spatial generalized linear mixed 
modeling of areal data with the localized conditional au­
toregressive priors proposed by Lee and Mitchel (23). We 
included the bioregions of the Iberian Peninsula (Atlantic/
Mediterranean) (24) as local conditional autoregressive 
priors because they have been shown to have distinct bo­
vine TB epidemiologic scenarios (7). We implemented 
models by using the CARBayes version 5.0 package (25) in 
R software. We based inference on 20,000 Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo iterations (200,000 iterations with a thin fac­
tor of 10 to reduce autocorrelation) after an initial burn-in 
of 40,000 iterations. Taking into consideration the home 
ranges of wild boar (26), we decided to include counties 
<25 km apart in the neighborhood matrix of each other.
We estimated domestic host absolute densities on the 
basis of data from the Portuguese Livestock Movement Da­
tabase (https://ifap.pt) with the following inclusion criteria: 
we considered only animals >6 months of age among free-
range pigs, extensively reared sheep and goats, and meat 
production cattle. We excluded intensively reared animals 
to provide more realistic estimates of the livestock popu­
lation at potential risk from contact with wildlife. Meat-
production cattle were selected as a proxy for extensive 
rearing because this is the predominant beef cattle produc­
tion system in Portugal, and dairy cattle herds are almost 
exclusively housed indoors.

RESEARCH
We selected hunting bag (number of animals hunted 
per square kilometer in 1 year) as a proxy for wild ungulate 
density and calculated this density as the annual average of 
the number of hunted ungulates (wild boar, red deer, and 
fallow deer) from those hunting areas for which >2 years 
of data were available for 2008–2012. Because hunting bag 
data were not available for 65/278 counties, we performed 
an inverse distance weighted interpolation with power set 
at 3 to obtain estimates for the entire territory.
We selected the proportion of the area of each county 
dedicated to commercial hunting (tourism and national hunt­
ing areas usually intensively managed for maximizing profit) 
as a proxy for intensity of game management. Other types of 
hunting areas are dedicated to recreational hunting (i.e., usu­
ally no fencing, restocking, or large-scale artificial feeding of 
large game species). We included the historical presence of 
wild boar as the distance from the centroid of each county to 
the nearest historical refuge (Figure 1, panel B). We calcu­
lated the incidence of bovine TB in cattle as the average of 
the annual incidence rate for each county during 2008–2012 
on the basis of data from the bovine TB eradication program.
We estimated a variance inflation factor to assess mul­
ticollinearity with a threshold of 5. We used a nonspatial 
logistic regression with backward stepwise elimination and 
selected the final model on the basis of Akaike information 
criterion corrected for small samples and model weights 
(27). We calculated the McFadden pseudo-R2 value to 
measure the goodness of fit of each model. We used the 
posterior probabilities of the spatial model to predict the 
risk for bovine TB in wild boar populations in all counties 
in Portugal. We assessed model convergence on the basis 
of the Geweke statistic (28).
Results
We found that 11 paired serum samples and PS elutes were 
positive for antibodies against bovine PPD, 9 were nega­
tive for both, and 2 were positive in serum and negative in 
elutes. There was an almost perfect agreement between se­
rologic results for both types of samples (mean ± SD Cohen 
unweighted κ value = 0.818 ± 0.121).
We detected antibodies against bovine PPD in 16/678 
wild boar (2.4%, 95% CI 1.5%–3.8%). Antibody-posi­
tive wild boar originated from 4/92 counties tested (Fig­
ure 1, panel C). Kulldorff spatial scan statistics identified 
2 clusters of bovine TB in wildlife. Cluster 1 was found 
in 1 county that had 8/36 positive wild boar (relative risk 
= 17.83, p<0.001), and cluster 2 was found in 5 counties 
(radius = 43 km) that had 8/65 positive wild boar (relative 
risk = 9.43, p = 0.011) (Figure 1, panel D).
The selected nonspatial logistic regression model 
with the presence of bovine TB as the dependent variable 
showed a McFadden pseudo-R2 value = 0.656 (Table 2). 
The spatial generalized linear mixed model (deviance in­
formation criterion = 24.141) that included the variables 
distance to historical refuge, bovine TB incidence in cattle, 
red deer hunting bag, intensity of management, and red 
deer hunting bag times intensity of management (Table 2) 
explained 45.5% of the deviance. The posterior probability 
of the presence of bovine TB in wildlife (Figure 2) was 
significantly higher for those counties with independent 
reports of isolation of M. bovis from free-ranging wildlife 
(Mann-Whitney–Wilcoxon W = 320; p<0.001) (26,29–32).
We further investigated bovine TB in southeastern Por­
tugal. This investigation included cluster 1, where M. bovis 
(n = 51) and M. caprae (n = 2) were isolated from 53/340 
wild boar in 6/17 hunting areas, which had an overall bac­
teriological culture prevalence of 15.6% (95% CI 12.1%–
19.8%). In 1 nonfenced hunting area, culture prevalence 
of wild boar bovine TB increased significantly (p = 0.049 
by Fisher exact test) from 46.2% (95% CI 26.6%–66.6%) 
during 2005–2006 (6) to 67.7% (95% CI 55.4%–78.0%) 
during 2009–2014 (Figure 3).
Discussion
We report a spatial analysis of bovine TB in wildlife in 
the multihost system of the Iberian Peninsula on the basis 
of serologic data for hunted wild boar. Serologic analysis 
was previously shown to have reasonably good sensitivity 
and excellent specificity for detecting bovine TB in wild 
boar (10), and this species is a suitable sentinel for bovine

TB (13–15). We provide evidence showing that dried blood 
spots collected on PS cards by nonspecialist personnel are 
appropriate for serologic surveys of bovine TB, as shown 
by the almost perfect agreement between serologic results 
for serum samples and elutes. These results were expected 
because dried blood spots have been extensively validated 
for many other human or animal host–pathogen systems 
and generally found to be suitable for serologic surveys, 
even when blood is collected in remote and demanding 
conditions (11,33). This combination of dried blood spots 
and serologic analysis is a major advance for large-scale 
surveillance of bovine TB in wildlife anywhere wild boar 
are a suitable indicator species.
Our results support previous data suggesting a 
strong spatial structure of bovine TB in wildlife. Two 
clusters were identified in southern (cluster 1) and cen­
tral-eastern (cluster 2) Portugal, which are located at the 
periphery of the high-prevalence core area in the cen­
tral-southwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula (4,5). 
A subsequent survey for bovine TB in cluster 1 relied on 
bacteriological culture of tissues collected from hunted 
wild boar, which is an established but more expensive 
and labor-intensive diagnostic technique than serologic 
analysis. This regional bacteriological survey confirmed 
bovine TB as an emerging disease in wildlife and docu­
mented a 46.2% increase in prevalence in less than a de­
cade at 1 nonfenced hunting area, similar to other popu­
lations in the Iberian Peninsula (4).
The spatial risk model we reported identified some pre­
dicted high-risk counties not included in the surveillance area 
for bovine TB in large game species (Figure 1, panel B) and 
thus could be used for better allocation of resources for wild­
life disease surveillance and public health protection. The 
spatial model of bovine TB risk in wildlife generally agrees 
with results of published independent surveys because most 
reported wildlife isolates of M. bovis and M. caprae overlap 
with predicted moderate-risk to high-risk areas. The single 
exception is M. bovis isolated from a wild boar in Coimbra 
in central-western Portugal (Figure 2), an area that has a low 
predicted risk for bovine TB in wildlife (30). Red deer were 
introduced into this region during 1995–1999 and some of 
the founder animals originated from bovine TB–infected ar­
eas included in cluster 1, in which the same spoligotype was 
also found in wild boar and red deer (17,30). No additional 
M. bovis isolates have been reported from this region, sug­
gesting that after the initial introduction and spillover into 
local wild boar, the infection waned or persists at a low prev­
alence, in accordance with the predicted low risk for bovine 
TB in our model.
This observation suggests that relatively dense red 
deer populations are needed to maintain bovine TB at a 
high prevalence in wild ungulate populations. This finding 
also contrasts with the situation reported from south-central

RESEARCH
Spain, where wild boar is considered the main maintenance 
host, probably because intensive game management is rare 
in Portugal, with similarities with what was described for 
the Atlantic bioregion of Spain (14,17). Further studies in­
volving spatially structured estimation of the abundance of 
wild ungulates and bovine TB prevalence along the edge 
of the infected area are warranted to identify the relative 
roles of wild boar and red deer densities in maintenance of 
bovine TB in this multihost system.
Red deer density and its interaction with the intensity of 
game management were associated with bovine TB in wild 
boar in the spatial risk model. Red deer density is a better 
predictor of bovine TB in wild boar populations than wild 
boar density, further strengthening the role of red deer as a 
key reservoir of bovine TB in wildlife in Portugal. The his­
torical dynamics of wild boar populations are associated 
with contemporary distribution of bovine TB. Starting in the 
mid-20th century, wild boar populations expanded from his­
torical refuges, and bovine TB in wildlife also seems to be 
increasing but at a much slower pace. One possible explana­
tion for this pattern is that as wild boar populations spread, 
densities at the front of the expansion wave were low (34). 
Thus, bovine TB could not be maintained even with the addi­
tion of infected animals from infected historical refuges. As 
expansion continued and wild boar densities increased (34), 
the range of M. bovis seems to be slowly increasing.
The incidence of bovine TB in livestock was included 
in the selected model and highlighted the link between do­
mestic and wild epidemiologic cycles in wildlife, which 
was strongly suspected on the basis of molecular epidemi­
ology data (30). Although the directionality of such a link 
could not be inferred in our study, spillover from wildlife 
was shown to partially explain incidence of bovine TB in 
cattle in south-central Spain (35), suggesting that bovine 
TB in livestock could be an indicator of local disease trans­
mission in wildlife.
In conclusion, we report a spatial analysis of bovine 
TB in wildlife in Portugal that used wild boar as a senti­
nel species and assessed the relative performance of dried 
blood spots collected on PS cards as a new sampling tool 
for large-scale serologic surveys. We confirmed the strong 
spatial clustering of bovine TB in wildlife and identified 
risk factors related to red deer density, intensity of wild un­
gulate management, historical population dynamics of wild 
boar, and incidence of bovine TB in cattle. The risk maps 
developed provide new tools for the targeted control of bo­
vine TB in wild ungulate populations and identify areas at 
high risk for spread of disease.

Rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis), a parasitic 
nematode that can cause eosinophilic meningitis in hu­
mans, was first detected in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, 
in the mid-1980s and now appears to be widespread in the 
southeastern United States. We assessed the distribution, 
prevalence, and intensity of A. cantonensis infection in 
New Orleans by examining lung biopsy samples of rodents 
trapped at 96 sites in 9 areas in Orleans Parish and 1 area 
in neighboring St. Bernard Parish during May 2015 through 
February 2017. These areas were selected to capture con­
trasting levels of income, flooding, and post-disaster land­
scape management after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. We 
detected A. cantonensis in all areas and in 3 of the 4 rat 
species trapped. Overall prevalence was ≈38% but varied 
by area, host species, and host species co-occurrence. 
Infection intensity also varied by host species. These find­
ings suggest that socioecological analysis of heterogeneity 
in definitive and intermediate host infection could improve 
understanding of health risks across the city.
C
oncern is increasing about the spread of rat lungworm 
(Angiostrongylus cantonensis), especially in the south­
eastern United States (1–5). A parasitic nematode carried 
by intermediate mollusk hosts and definitive rat hosts (6,7), 
rat lungworm can cause eosinophilic meningitis in humans 
who become infected by ingesting intermediate hosts or 
paratenic hosts, such as freshwater shrimp and frogs (6,7). 
A. cantonensis was first reported in North America from 
Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) trapped in New Orleans, 
Louisiana, USA, along the Mississippi River during April 
1986 through February 1987 (8). Later surveys suggest the 
parasite has since become more widespread in Louisiana. 
Surveys of intermediate apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) 
hosts, for example, detected the parasite in suburban areas of 
New Orleans (3,9). Infections have also since been reported 
in nonhuman incidental mammal hosts (9,10), and 2 cases of 
human eosinophilic meningitis from rat lungworm infection 
were diagnosed in nearby areas of Louisiana (11,12). Rat 
lungworm also appears to have become widespread across 
Florida (9) and has been recently detected in Oklahoma (11).
We trapped rodents across New Orleans to character­
ize the current distribution, prevalence, and intensity of A. 
cantonensis infection and to determine how these aspects 
vary according to organismal and ecological characteris­
tics of definitive hosts, including species co-occurrence. 
This study enabled us to identify factors associated with 
definitive host infection, which might affect transmission 
risk across the city and offer further insight into the global 
progression, surveillance, and control of rodent-associated 
infectious disease.
Methods
Study Animals
We collected rats during May 2015 through February 2017 
(following Tulane University [New Orleans, LA, USA] In­
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee [IACUC] pro­
tocol #0451) during a quantitative population survey across 
96 city blocks in 8 neighborhoods in New Orleans, a natural 
area in Orleans Parish, and an area in neighboring St. Ber­
nard Parish. These areas were selected to capture contrasting 
levels of income, flooding, and postdisaster landscape man­
agement after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Figure 1; online 
Technical Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/12/18-0056-Techapp1.pdf) (13,14). We selected 
8–10 sites in each study area by random stratification across 
a 1-km resolution grid spanning the city. Each site was vis­
ited 4 times during May 2015 through January 2017: once 
during summer and once during winter months each year, 
except for sites in St. Bernard Parish, which were visited 
only twice (summer 2016 and winter 2016–17). During each 
trapping period, 30 Tomahawk Live traps (Hazelhurst, WI, 
USA) were set in locations with potential or evident rodent 
activity for a minimum of 3 consecutive nights. Trapping 
efforts continued at each site until no additional rats were

captured. Sherman traps (H.B. Sherman Traps, Inc., Talla­
hassee, FL, USA) were also placed at a subset of 48 sites to 
capture smaller rodents following the same approach (Tu­
lane University IACUC protocol #0460).
All rodents were necropsied after euthanasia following 
Tulane University IACUC protocols #0451 and #0460. We 
recorded standard weight and length measurements, as well 
as species identity; sex; sexual maturity; and, in females, 
parity. We categorized all Norway rats and roof rats (R. rat­
tus) into 3 age classes (juvenile, subadult, adult) according to 
body weight (15,16). Urine, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and 
tail tissues were sampled and archived in –80°C freezers. 
We visually screened lung tissues for parasites, which were 
isolated, counted, and preserved in 95% ethanol. Representa­
tive lung parasites were identified through PCR (17) (online 
Technical Appendix; online Technical Appendix Table 2).

Statistical Analyses
We report on the distribution and prevalence of A. cantonen­
sis according to all species trapped, but additional statistical 
analyses considered data only from Norway rats and roof 
rats because of small sample sizes or because the parasite 
was not detected in other species. Generalized linear models 
(GLMs) were constructed with a quasibinomial error distri­
bution to determine whether sex or age class was a signifi­
cant predictor of infection status (i.e., infected, not infected) 
in Norway rats and roof rats. We ran 3 GLMs: 1 with both 
Rattus species together and 1 for each species. The same pre­
dictors were used in 3 GLMs with a quasi-Poisson distribu­
tion to examine relationships with infection intensity (i.e., 
number of parasites per infected rodent) in Norway rats and 
roof rats together and separately by species.
We used χ2 tests to determine whether infection preva­
lence in Norway rats and roof rats differed among study ar­
eas, and among sites with 1 versus >1 species present. We 
ran a subset of pairwise tests to compare prevalence among 
study areas, correcting for multiple comparisons.
We used a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare infection 
intensity among areas, combining data from Norway rats 
and roof rats. We used Mann-Whitney U tests to compare 
infection intensity between Norway rats and roof rats and 
to compare intensity among sites with 1 or >1 species pres­
ent. We conducted all statistical analyses using R version 
3.4.2 (https://www.r-project.org/).
Results
Rodent Trapping and Overall Prevalence of 
A. cantonensis
A total of 696 rats were trapped at 78 of the 96 sampling 
sites. Both Norway rats and roof rats were found in all 10 
areas, whereas hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) were 
found in the natural area and the Lower 9th Ward, and rice 
rats (Oryzomys palustris) were found only in the natural area.
We detected A. cantonensis in all 10 areas (Figure 1) 
and in 3 of the 4 rat species sampled. Of the 444 roof rats 
necropsied, 160 (36.0%) were positive for A. cantonensis, 
whereas 101 (44.1%) of 229 Norway rats, 4 (21.1%) of 19 
S. hispidus, and 0 of 4 O. palustris were positive (Table 
1). Prevalence differed between Norway rats and roof 
rats (χ2 = 3.810, p = 0.051). Median site-level prevalence 
estimates for roof rats (33.3%) and Norway rats (47.2%) 
(online Technical Appendix Figure) were similar to those 
estimated by pooling rats by species and area (Table 1).
A total of 488 house mice (Mus musculus) were col­
lected at 48 locations with Sherman traps. Lungworms 
were not detected in any house mice, affirming that they do 
not serve as definitive hosts (18).
Geographic Variation in Prevalence
Excluding the St. Bernard Parish sites because of small sam­
ple sizes (n = 5), we found that overall prevalence in both 
Norway rats and roof rats differed among the sampled areas 
(χ2 = 81.21, p<0.001). Rats from the Bywater area exhibited 
the highest overall prevalence of A. cantonensis infection 
(71%), whereas rats from the French Quarter exhibited the 
lowest (8%) (Table 1; online Technical Appendix; online 
Technical Appendix Table 3). Most median site-level preva­
lence values (Figure 2, panel A) were similar to those esti­
mated by pooling rats by species and area (Table 1).
Considering roof rats and Norway rats separately in 
areas with >10 samples, we found that prevalence dif­
fered among areas for both species (roof rats, χ2 = 46.755, 
p<0.0001; Norway rats, χ2 = 43.62, p<0.0001). Prevalence 
in roof rats was lowest for rats trapped in the Lakeview 
area (10%) and highest for those from the Bywater area 
(70%), although pairwise comparisons showed that prev­
alence differed only among a subset of the study areas 
(online Technical Appendix; online Technical Appendix 
Table 4). Prevalence in Norway rats was lowest for rats 
trapped in the French Quarter (2%) and highest among 
those from the Gentilly area (80%). As with roof rats, 
prevalence in Norway rats differed only among a subset of 
the study areas (online Technical Appendix; online Tech­
nical Appendix Table 5).

RESEARCH
Infection prevalence was significantly lower in sites 
where only 1 rat species was trapped (30%, n = 267, 48 
sites) than in sites that harbored multiple rat species (44%, n 
= 429, 30 sites) (χ2 = 11.654, p<0.001). However, sites with 
1 species had significantly fewer rodents (mean 5.6) than 
sites with multiple species (mean 14.3) (Mann-Whitney U 
test, p<0.0001).
Likelihood of Infection
Considering Norway rats and roof rats together, the likeli­
hood of infection did not differ by sex (df = 656, coefficient 
= 0.13133, p = 0.42), but adults were significantly more 
likely to be infected than juveniles (df = 656, coefficient = 
–1.26201, p<0.0001) and subadults (df = 656, coefficient = 
–0.42601, p<0.05) (online Technical Appendix Table 6).
When we considered species separately, we also de­
tected differences in the likelihood of infection according 
to age class. The likelihood of infection in Norway rats 
did not differ by sex (df = 224, coefficient = –0.04621, p 
= 0.86), but adults were more likely to be infected than 
either juveniles (df  =  224, coefficient  = –1.88906, p = 
0.003) or subadults (df = 224, coefficient = –0.82707, p 
= 0.007) (online Technical Appendix Table 6). Among 
roof rats, likelihood of infection did not differ by sex (df = 
427, coefficient = 0.2305, p = 0.26) or between adults and 
subadults (df = 427, coefficient = –0.1541, p = 0.54), but 
adults were more likely than juveniles to be infected (df = 
427, coefficient = –0.9550, p = 0.004) (online Technical 
Appendix Table 6).
Infection Intensity
Infection intensity (Table 2) significantly differed be­
tween roof rats and Norway rats (Mann-Whitney U test, 
p<0.01). Considering Norway rats and roof rats together 
across all areas, infection intensity did not differ by sex 
(df = 240, coefficient = 0.01331, p = 0.972). Subadults 
had lower infection intensity than adults (df = 240, co­
efficient = –0.44999, p = 0.0124), but juveniles did not 
(df = 240, coefficient = 0.0595, p = 0.82) (online Tech­
nical Appendix Table 7). Excluding the St. Bernard and 
French Quarter areas, each of which had only 4 infected 
rodents, we did not detect significant differences in infec­
tion intensity across the sampled areas (Kruskal-Wallis 
test, p = 0.484). Also, we found no differences in infec­
tion intensity between sites with 1 species (8.75, n = 79) 
versus multiple species present (11.74, n = 186) (Mann-
Whitney U test, p = 0.072). Some median site-level in­
tensities within areas (Figure 2, panel B) differed from 
intensities estimated by pooling all rats of each species 
within each area (Table 2). When we considered species 
separately, infection intensity did not differ according to 
sex or age class for Norway rats (all p>0.05) or roof rats 
(all p>0.05) (online Technical Appendix Table 7).
Discussion
We assessed the current distribution and prevalence of A. 
cantonensis in definitive rat hosts across New Orleans, 
where the parasite has been present since at least 1986 
(8). Our overall estimate of 38% infection prevalence in 
New Orleans is comparable to count-based estimates re­
ported for other areas where A. cantonensis is considered 
endemic (19,20, but see 21). We also found A. canto­
nensis in rats across New Orleans and in neighboring St. 
Bernard Parish, which contrasts with the patchy distribu­
tions exhibited by other rodent-associated pathogens in 
cities (22–25). Although rat lungworm is present across 
New Orleans, infection prevalence varied according to 
geography and rodent host species, suggesting the risk 
for transmission to humans might be mediated in part 
by geographically variable landscape features that affect 
commensal rats (13,14). It is also likely, however, that the

*Intensity was computed for each species and each area as the sum of all lungworms counted, divided by the total number of lungworm-positive rodents 
for which lungworms were counted (in parentheses). Totals represent overall intensity and numbers positive, pooled by neighborhood, by species, or both 
(total lungworms/total infected rats). Roof rats, Rattus rattus; Norway rats, R. norvegicus; cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus; rice rats, Oryzomys palustris. 
Dashes indicate no rats were positive, except in the Lakeview area, where no count data were available for the 1 positive rat trapped. 
Rat Lungworm in Rodents, New Orleans
found for Norway rats and roof rats trapped in 1986–1987 
(8). However, evidence of infection was found only in Nor­
way rats; A. cantonensis was detected in 20 (21%) of 94 
trapped Norway rats and in 0 of 19 trapped roof rats (8). In 
comparison, we found overall prevalence >18% in 8 of the 
10 trapping areas in our study (Table 1), and we detected 
infected roof rats in all trapping areas. However, it is un­
clear whether the distribution of rodent host infections has 
changed, because the 1986–1987 surveys were limited to 
trapping on wharves along the Mississippi River (8). Thus, 
although we can affirm that infection prevalence varies by 
geography and definitive host (8), we cannot conclude that 
A. cantonensis became more broadly distributed across the 
city during the past 3 decades.
Evidence of greater prevalence and infection intensity 
of A. cantonensis in adult rats most likely reflects the in­
creasing probability over time that an individual rat will 
consume an infected intermediate host and that infection 
becomes more evident in lung tissue. Waugh et al. (19) 
similarly reported differences in intensity and prevalence 
in rats from Jamaica according to size but not sex, although 
an earlier study found that female Norway rats were more 
likely to be infected (26). Evidence that A. cantonensis in­
fection differs by host age contrasts with findings for other 
urban rodent–associated pathogens, including flea-vec­
tored Bartonella bacteria (25). The finding of distinct Bar­
tonella species in Norway rats and roof rats (25) suggests 
that co-occurrence does not facilitate pathogen transmis­
sion, whereas our results indicate otherwise. Contrasting 
patterns in the demography of definitive host infection may 
reflect pathogen-specific differences in transmission path­
ways. Further study is therefore warranted to determine the 
roles of definitive host abundance and diversity in patho­
gen transmission.
It has been more than a decade since the last diagnosed 
case of rat lungworm infection in the New Orleans area 
(12), which suggests that factors unrelated to rodent hosts 
mitigate the risk for transmission to humans. Although 
the most recent case in Louisiana resulted from consump­
tion of a paratenic host (12), work elsewhere suggests that 
transmission to humans most likely occurs through acci­
dental consumption of raw or undercooked infected snails 
on produce (7). Accordingly, the distribution and abun­
dance of infected intermediate hosts are probably key fac­
tors affecting transmission risk, especially in cities such as 
New Orleans, where interest in urban agriculture is on the 
rise (27,28). It is also possible that risk is influenced by 
climate-driven spread of invasive mollusks (29,30), such 
as apple snails, that can serve as reservoirs (1,3). Further 
study of infection prevalence in intermediate hosts would 
thus probably improve understanding of transmission risk 
across New Orleans and other cities that are vulnerable to 
climate change.
We intentionally diagnosed infection through a visual 
and count-based survey to draw comparisons to histori­
cal records, but implementing complementary approaches 
could have provided further understanding of A. cantonen­
sis infection. As has been noted in prior studies (19,20), 
count-based approaches probably yield conservative esti­
mates relative to PCR-based approaches of infection. For 
example, in Hawaii, a count-based approach yielded a 
prevalence estimate of 54%, whereas PCR yielded an es­
timate of 100% (20). More extensive use of PCR-based 
approaches in our study probably would have afforded 
additional perspective on parasitism and could also have 
excluded possible errors due to misidentification (31–33).
Our results indicate that cross-disciplinary analysis of 
A. cantonensis infection could shed further light on the risk 
for transmission to humans (34). As has been found with 
other zoonoses, human risk might correspond to socio­
ecological disparities in habitat and resources favored by 
infected definitive and intermediate hosts (22,23,35–38). 
For example, Rael et al. (13) detected a positive correla­
tion between land abandonment and rat abundance in New 
Orleans across only low-income neighborhoods. The con­
trasting landscapes (14) and rodent assemblages (Table 1) 
found in the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans and in adja­
cent St. Bernard Parish highlight the possibility that public 
health risks have been shaped by differences in postdisaster 
(i.e., Hurricane Katrina) land management policies (29). 
Although too few rats were trapped in St. Bernard Parish (n 
= 5) to confidently estimate rat lungworm prevalence (Ta­
ble 1), the observed differences in rat abundance suggest 
that transmission risk sharply differs between the Lower 
9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish. Thus, further study of 
associations between definitive and intermediate host in­
fection and socioecological factors probably would better 
define transmission risk across the city (14,39).
Although rat lungworm is just 1 of many pathogens 
harbored by urban rats (40,41), citywide estimates of host 
infection like those presented here can provide an epidemio­
logic baseline that can improve understanding of infectious 
disease dynamics in cities. Baselines are particularly infor­
mative for cities where zoonotic pathogens are likely to (re)
emerge because of shifting climate conditions (30,40,42) or 
extreme events, such as hurricanes, that can foster disease 
outbreaks (13). New Orleans unenviably straddles both sets 
of circumstances (43–45). Accordingly, further study of rat 
lungworm could help inform public health policies, surveil­
lance programs, and intervention to safeguard the well-being 
of vulnerable communities in New Orleans and elsewhere.

Host migration and emerging pathogens are strongly asso­
ciated, especially with regard to zoonotic diseases. West 
Nile virus (WNV), a mosquitoborne pathogen capable of 
causing severe, sometimes fatal, neuroinvasive disease in 
humans, is maintained in highly mobile avian hosts. Using 
phylogeographic approaches, we investigated the relation­
ship between WNV circulation in the United States and the 
flight paths of terrestrial birds. We demonstrated southward 
migration of WNV in the eastern flyway and northward mi­
gration in the central flyway, which is consistent with the 
looped flight paths of many terrestrial birds. We also identi­
fied 3 optimal locations for targeted WNV surveillance cam­
paigns in the United States—Illinois, New York, and Texas. 
These results illustrate the value of multidisciplinary ap­
proaches to surveillance of infectious diseases, especially 
zoonotic diseases.
W
est Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquitoborne virus that 
can cause severe and even fatal disease in humans. 
After WNV introduction into New York, NY, USA, its geo­
graphic range expanded quickly, reaching the West Coast 
in 2003. Previous studies have shown that the spread of 
WNV occurred faster than could be explained by contigu­
ous diffusion (1–4) and demonstrated that its expansion oc­
curred heterogeneously, consisting of contiguous diffusion 
and long distance translocations (2,5). Since then, phylo­
geographic studies have reported frequent mixing of WNV 
strains from local and distant locations. The most notable 
exception is California, where several genetic studies have 
shown limited movement into and out of the state (6,7).
The rapid expansion of WNV in the United States 
probably cannot be attributed to the movement of humans 
because humans are dead-end hosts. However, in nature, 
WNV is maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle in­
volving mosquito vectors and highly mobile avian reser­
voirs. Hyalomma marginatum ticks have also been impli­
cated in the transmission of WNV (8).
Although evidence of WNV infection has been identi­
fied in many species of birds, deaths and disease among 
birds vary greatly, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal in­
fections; peak viremia potentially reaches >1012 PFU/mL 
(9). WNV RNA has been detected in bird spleen and kid­
neys as long as 36 weeks after infection (10) and in brains 
of Nestor notabilis kea up to 72 months after infection (11).
Although phylogenetic evidence of geographic cluster­
ing by location is limited, a recent study reported that WNV 
isolates clustered according to avian flyway (12). Because 
birds are the primary reservoirs for WNV, this finding was 
not surprising, but it is relevant because bird migration has 
also been implicated in the movement of influenza A virus 
(13), Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease agent) (14), other 
pathogenic organisms (1), and even invasive invertebrate or­
ganisms (15). Several serologic studies (e.g., ELISA, plaque 
reduction neutralization test) have been used to determine 
the direction of WNV movement within the Atlantic, Missis­
sippi, and Pacific flyways and demonstrated WNV in birds 
migrating southward, whereas evidence of the virus in birds 
during northward migration is limited (16,17).
Studies of virus movement associated with avian hosts 
in the United States have concentrated on the migration of 
waterfowl and excluded terrestrial birds, largely because 
the migratory patterns of waterfowl have been thorough­
ly characterized by banding studies. However, passerine 
birds, the primary reservoir for WNV, are terrestrial birds, 
not waterfowl. Terrestrial birds and waterfowl fly along 
similar but distinct flyways. Although waterfowl follow 
regular paths bounded by mountains and rivers, terres­
trial birds often follow looped routes that enable them to 
maximize tail winds, avoid head winds, and correlate with 
seasonal fluctuations in food availability (18,19). Although 
looped migration paths have been described for several

RESEARCH
Terrestrial Bird Migration and West Nile Virus
species of birds (Selasphorus rufus hummingbirds [20], 
Circus aeruginosus western marsh harriers [21], Falco ele­
onorae Eleonora’s falcons [22], Cuculus canorus common 
cuckoos [23]), the general flyways of terrestrial birds have 
been inadequately studied. However, in 2014, La Sorte et 
al. provided a general description of terrestrial bird flyways 
in North America (18). They defined 3 flyways: the single 
distinct Western flyway and 2 overlapping flyways, the 
Central and Eastern flyways. A similar 3-flyways system 
(Pacific, Central, and Atlantic flyways) has been described 
for waterfowl (24); however, most studies have relied on 
the more common 4-flyways system (Pacific, Central, Mis­
sissippi, and Atlantic flyways). In this study, we used phy­
logeographic approaches to investigate the relationship be­
tween WNV circulation in the United States and the flight 
paths of terrestrial birds. 
Methods
Generation of Alignments
We identified all unique sequences of natural and labora­
tory WNV strains by using the Virus Variation Resource 
(25). Virus sequences meeting the following criteria were 
included in this study: 1) the nucleotide sequence spanned 
the complete open reading frame, 2) the sequence was de­
rived from natural isolates and not laboratory strains, 3) the 
sequence was unique (i.e., all sequences differed by >1 nt), 
and 4) the sequence contained no degenerate nucleotides. 
All sequences were manually aligned in BioEdit version 
7.1.3 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) or 
MEGA7 (https://www.megasoftware.net/), and noncoding 
regions were removed when necessary (i.e., the open read­
ing frame was used for analyses).
Isolation of Viral RNA and Next-Generation Sequencing
We obtained additional WNV isolates from the World Ref­
erence Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the 
University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (Galves­
ton, TX, USA) (26). Isolates were originally collected from 
Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and Colorado. We extracted viral 
RNA from the supernatant of infected Vero cells by using 
a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, 
MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
We generated libraries with a TruSeq RNA version 2 kit (Il­
lumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and samples sequenced by 
the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston Next 
Generation Sequencing Core on an Illumina 1500 Hi-Seq 
platform. Adaptor sequences and poor quality reads (Q score 
<20) were removed with Trimmomatic (27). Reads were 
aligned with Bowtie2 (28) under the sensitive local param­
eter against the prototypical strain of WNV (NY99 flamingo 
382–99, GenBank accession no. AF196835). Consensus se­
quences were generated by using SAMtools (29).
Phylogeny
To evaluate temporal structure, we generated a time-naive 
phylogeny (i.e., a maximum-likelihood phylogeny) to enable 
determination of the patristic distance between all isolates on 
the phylogeny. We generated maximum-likelihood trees with 
RAxML-HPC Black Box on Cyberinfrastructure for Phylo­
genetic Research version 3.3 (30) and determined automatic 
halting by bootstrapping. We determined the root-to-tip dis­
tance, which is a phylogenetic measure of genetic distance, 
for each isolate of the maximum-likelihood phylogenies by 
using TempEst (formerly Path-o-gen) (31). We evaluated the 
correlation (Pearson method) between root-to-tip distance 
and collection date in R (https://www.r-project.org/).
We used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) approach to infer phylogeographic relationships 
and selected the most appropriate phylogenetic model by 
using standard path sampling and stepping-stone approach­
es. XML files were generated in BEAUti version 1.8.3 or 
1.8.4 and run with BEAST version 1.8.4 (32) on Cyberin­
frastructure for Phylogenetic Research (30). We used the 
GTR+Γ+I (general time reversible with gamma rate dis­
tribution and invariable sites) model to infer nucleotide 
substitution frequencies, an uncorrelated lognormal clock 
model to infer the mutation rate, and a Bayesian Skyline 
tree prior to model changes in population size. The evolu­
tion rate mean was restricted to 10–4 through 9 × 10–4 substi­
tutions/site/year, consistent with previously reported rates 
for WNV evolution (7,33).
We ran trees with an MCMC length of 100 million 
and sampled every 5,000 steps. Log files were reviewed 
in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) to deter­
mine burn-in, which ranged from 5% through 10%. We ran

multiple independent MCMC chains until effective sample 
size values exceeded 200. Log and tree files were combined 
in LogCombiner version 1.8, and a maximum clade cred­
ibility tree was generated in TreeAnnotator (32). Locations 
were inferred by using ancestral state reconstruction with 
an asymmetric discrete trait substitution model (34).
Analysis of Migration
After the XML files were generated in BEAUti, we manu­
ally edited them to enable counting of all Markov jumps 
(MJ) (which described the relative magnitude of migration 
out of source locations and into sink locations) for 2001 
through 2009 (35). This method for evaluating migration, 
first described by Minin and Suchard (35), has been used to 
characterize migration of several major pathogens includ­
ing rabies virus (36), dengue virus (37), HIV (38), influ­
enza virus (39,40), and Rift Valley fever virus (41).
As expected for an emerging zoonotic disease, the 
annual West Nile neurologic disease (WNND) inci­
dence and sample collection efforts varied dramatically 
among states over time, adding substantial complexity 
to the model. To mitigate the effects of inconsistent sam­
pling and to confirm the observed results, we applied a 
stricter inclusion criterion to confirm the results obtained 
by using the full dataset. The sequences were randomly 
down-sampled such that the number of sequences used cor­
related (p<0.05 by Pearson method) with the incidence of 
WNND reported to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) in a particular year (the most accurate 
record of relative WNV activity). Our analysis ensured that 
the dataset was representative of the WNV activity of each 
region in a particular year.
We calculated incidence by using the number of WNND 
cases reported to CDC from each state during each year and 
dividing that number by the estimated population of each 
state. The population estimates were obtained from the Time 
Series of Intercensal State Population Estimates available 
at the Population Division of the US Census Bureau (42). 
States with insufficient sequences to represent the WNND 
incidence were excluded. Down-sampling was undertaken in 
at least duplicate to ensure that reduction in sample size and 
diversity did not remove important relationships.

Sequence Collection
All previously published sequences of natural WNV iso­
lates collected in the United States were obtained from Gen­
Bank on January 1, 2016. The number of WNV sequences 
varied substantially over time and among locations, which

presented statistical challenges. In particular, although 
GenBank has >900 WNV open reading frames, most come 
from a few states where laboratories were actively involved 
in WNV surveillance and research: California, New York, 
and Texas. The ability to compare multiple isolates over 
multiple years was critical to the analysis. Only a few states 
had sufficient numbers of WNV sequences available in 
GenBank to enable analysis for multiple consecutive years: 
New York, Connecticut, Illinois, North Dakota, South Da­
kota, Texas, and California.
To mitigate the influence of sampling bias, we ob­
tained additional WNV isolates from the World Refer­
ence Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses for 3 
states and sequences to support the analysis: Virginia (n 
= 39), Georgia (n = 20), and Colorado (n = 31) (Table 1, 
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0382-T1.
htm). Given that previous studies have demonstrated lim­
ited WNV movement into or out of California (6,7), we did 
not include isolates from California in the analysis. Similar­
ly, because of the proximity of New York and Connecticut, 
we chose New York to represent WNV in the Northeast be­
cause Connecticut is a small state. Last, to ensure that each 
location was represented across a similar time frame, we 
included only isolates collected during 2001–2009 in the 
Bayesian phylogeny and migration analysis. Table 2 shows 
the states and availability of yearly isolates.
Model Selection
We compared 203 nucleotide substitution models by using 
the Bayesian and Akaike Information Criteria in JModel-
Test2 (https://github/com/ddariba/jmodeltest2) and found 
the GTR+Γ+I model to be the most appropriate. For assess­
ing temporal signature, we used a maximum-likelihood tree 
with sequences of WNV strains from New York, Virginia, 
Georgia, Illinois, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and 
Colorado (n = 379) (Figure 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/12/18-0382-F1.htm). We identified a statistically 
significant positive correlation (r = 0.93, 95% highest poste­
rior density [HPD] = 0.92–0.94; p<2.2 × 10–16) between the 
root-to-tip distance and the date of isolation in Temp-Est (for­
merly known as Path-O-gen) (Figure 2). The mutation rate 
was estimated to be 4.05 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year, and 
the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was in 1997. To­
gether these results indicated a strong temporal signal in the 
dataset. Finally, we evaluated Bayesian tree priors (skyride, 
skygrid, and skyline) and uncorrelated clock models (lognor­
mal and exponential) by using path-sampling and stepping-
stone approaches. The uncorrelated lognormal clock model 
with the Bayesian skyline tree prior was the most appropriate.
Phylogeographic Analysis for the United States
Analysis of all WNV sequences collected from New York, 
Virginia, Georgia, Illinois, North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Texas, and Colorado during 2001–2009 provided estimates 
of the introduction date of the MRCA and mean evolution 
rate that were consistent with the estimates of the root-to-
tip distance analysis (Table 3; Figure 3, https://wwwnc.
cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0382-F3.htm). The date of

Terrestrial Bird Migration and West Nile Virus
MRCA introduction was estimated as 1997, and the aver­
age evolution rate was 3.92 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year.
We used MJ between reconstructed ancestral states 
to estimate the magnitude of relative migration out of, 
or into, each of the 8 regions (Table 4; Table 5, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0382-T5.htm). 
Frequent migration (>2 MJ) was detected from Illinois 
to Colorado (8.38 MJ), Illinois to Georgia (8.23 MJ), Il­
linois to North Dakota (10.43 MJ), Illinois to New York 
(29.97 MJ), Illinois to South Dakota (6.69 MJ), Illinois 
to Texas (22.87 MJ), Illinois to Virginia (11.45 MJ), 
New York to Colorado (4.36 MJ), New York to Georgia 
(7.04 MJ), New York to South Dakota (2.18 MJ), New 
York to Texas (4.56 MJ), New York to Virginia (4.24 
MJ), Texas to Colorado (9.78 MJ), Texas to North Da­
kota (5.18 MJ), Texas to South Dakota (7.56 MJ), and 
Virginia to Georgia (3.62 MJ).
Overall, 3 major sources of WNV circulation (New 
York, Illinois, and Texas) seemed to be the origin of 88.5% 
of the total migration events observed (Table 4; Figure 4). 
Southward and westward movements were detected along 
the East Coast, but only northward movement was observed 
within the central United States. A notable exception was 
observed in Illinois, where evidence of WNV movement in 
all directions was demonstrated.
Incidence-Controlled Phylogeny
To mitigate the effects of inconsistent sampling, we applied 
a stricter inclusion criterion to ensure that the dataset was 
representative of WNV activity in each region in a particu­
lar year. In this approach, the sequences were randomly 
down-sampled by using the sample command in R, such 
that the number of sequences was proportional to the inci­
dence of WNND reported to CDC (Table 6). Illinois, North 
Dakota, and South Dakota were not included in the down-
sampled datasets because there were insufficient sequences 
to represent WNND incidence in these states. To ensure 
that reduction in sample size and diversity did not remove

important relationships, the down-sampling was indepen­
dently performed twice.
According to the 2 incidence-controlled datasets, the 
MRCA was ≈1997 in both down-sampling exercises (95% 
HPD 1996.00  1998.52 and 95% HPD 1995.7  1998.25), 
and the overall mutation rates were estimated to be 4.02 × 
10-4 and 3.83 × 10–4 substitutions/site/year (Table 7; Figure 
5, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0382-F5.
htm). As with the full dataset, the Markov analysis dem­
onstrated that New York and Texas were strong sources 
of WNV circulation. Significant movement (mean >2 MJ) 
was detected from Texas to Colorado (20.42 and 20.44 MJ); 
Texas to New York (12.36 and 11.77 MJ); Texas to Geor­
gia (8.28 and 9.55 MJ); Texas to Virginia (7.14 and 7.732 
MJ); New York to Georgia (6.1 and 5.38 MJ); New York 
to Virginia (4.95 and 3.65 MJ); New York to Colorado 
(4.04 and 2.66 MJ); New York to Texas (2.66 and 2.73 
MJ); Virginia to Georgia (1.55 and 3.62 MJ); and, in data­
set 2 only, Virginia to Colorado (1.31 MJ) (Figure 6).
Together, the MJ analyses of the incidence-controlled 
dataset and the full dataset illustrate a consistent pattern 
of WNV circulation. All southward movement originated 
in the eastern United States (New York and Virginia), and 
most of the northward movement originated in the central 
United States (Texas) (Figure 7).

Terrestrial Bird Migration and West Nile Virus
evidence-based approaches are critical for managing 
emerging infectious diseases, but effective and efficient 
countermeasures will be possible only after the relation­
ships between pathogens and their hosts have been thor­
oughly characterized.
Bird migration has been implicated in the movement 
of a variety of pathogens (1). In particular, character­
ization of the relationship between avian influenza vi­
rus movement and waterfowl migration has supported 
surveillance and early warning programs (1,43). How­
ever, studies of avian hosts in the Americas have main­
ly concentrated on the migration of waterfowl to the 
exclusion of terrestrial birds because waterfowl are easily 
tracked with banding; thus, their migration has been 
thoroughly characterized.
The introduction and subsequent spread of WNV into 
the Americas underscores the invasive potential of emerg­
ing pathogens in the New World, as has been recently ex­
emplified by Zika virus, another mosquitoborne flavivirus. 
Dramatic variations in the location, timing, and intensity 
of WNV strain collection and sequencing has left the field 
with a limited understanding of virus circulation patterns 
and no reliable way of predicting the geographic spread of 
WNV outbreaks. We have addressed this knowledge gap

Figure 5. Incidence-controlled phylogeny of Eastern and Central flyways, United States. Sequences were down-sampled such that the 
number of sequences was proportional to the annual incidence of West Nile neurologic disease incidence for each location between 2001 
and 2009. Down-sampling was undertaken twice (A and B) to ensure that the reduction in sequences did not result in a substantial loss of 
diversity. Illinois, North Dakota, and South Dakota were not included in the incidence-control analysis because too few sequences were 
available to support down-sampling. Bayesian approaches were used to generate maximum-clade credibility trees. Scale bars indicate 
nucleotide substitutions per site.

by characterizing the movement of WNV with regard to the 
migratory patterns of its natural hosts, terrestrial birds. We 
compiled 379 virus sequences for analysis, including 289 
previously reported sequences from New York, Virginia, 
Georgia, Illinois, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and 
Colorado, plus 90 novel sequences from Virginia, Georgia, 
and Colorado.
Phylogeographic analysis revealed that 3 locations— 
New York, Illinois, and Texas—accounted for 88.5% of 
the total WNV MJ inferred. Because New York is the pre­
sumed original introduction point for WNV into the United 
States, its role as a major source of WNV movement was 
expected. However, 74.2% of the observed MJ originated 
in Illinois and Texas only. Of note, North Dakota and South 
Dakota, which are 2 of the states with the highest annual 
WNND incidence, seem to be strong sinks for WNV mov­
ing out of Illinois and Texas.
The contributions of Illinois and Texas to WNV circu­
lation are not surprising because both locations are situated 
at major convergence points between the Eastern and Cen­
tral flyways. In the case of Texas, birds from both flyways 
may avoid long-distance flights across the Gulf of Mexico 
by traveling along the circa-Gulf route that follows the Gulf 
Coast through Texas into Mexico. In the case of Illinois, 
seasonal shifts in terrestrial bird migration routes ensure 
that Illinois supports birds from the Eastern and Central 
flyways during annual migrations.
Of note, although mosquito and WNV activity occurs 
earlier in the southern than in the northern United States, 
southward migration was detected along the East Coast 
during our sampling period, 2002–2009, indicating that the 
southeastern United States is probably a dead end for WNV 
circulation. Indeed, low-level transmission probably oc­
curs during the winter in warmer locations such as Florida, 
Texas, and Louisiana. This possibility is supported by iso­
lations of WNV from mosquitoes and birds during Decem­
ber and January in Harris County, Texas (44), and suggests 
that ecologic factors not related to mosquito abundance and 
WNV activity drive WNV movement along the East Coast. 
Instead, movement of WNV into the northeastern United 
States (New York) from Illinois and Texas was observed 
(in the incident-controlled analysis). These results suggest 
that introduction of WNV into the northeastern United 
States originated from the central United States.
Overall, we have defined the pattern of WNV circula­
tion in the United States (Figure 7) and demonstrated looped 
virus movement patterns in the Eastern and Central flyways 
that are bridged by Illinois, a region shared between the

2 flyways. This specific pattern correlates with the looped 
migration patterns of terrestrial birds. Although other geo­
graphic regions may contribute to virus movement, there 
were insufficient virus sequences available from other 
states to incorporate into this analysis. Thus, on the basis of 
available information, 3 of the 8 locations considered (New 
York, Illinois, and Texas) seem to be the preferred sites for 
efficiently monitoring ongoing WNV evolution.
As new WNV sequences become available, similar 
phylogeographic methods can be used to develop more 
detailed information about WNV circulation in the United 
States. For example, on the East Coast, WNV circulation 
occurs southward, so surveillance efforts in the Northeast 
are likely to be more informative than surveillance in the 
Southeast. Conversely, WNV in the central United States 
travels northward, so surveillance in the south-central 
United States is more likely than surveillance in the north-
central United States to be informative. Last, the region 
of overlap between the Eastern and Central flyways is the 
most likely location for deriving surveillance information 
because WNV in this area travels in multiple directions.
Collectively, the results of this study illustrate the val­
ue of using multidisciplinary approaches to surveillance of 
infectious diseases, especially zoonotic diseases. Animal 
migration is shaped by a delicate balance of ecologic fac­
tors and anthropomorphic barriers. Natural and manmade 
events (e.g., climate change, atmospheric fluctuations, hab­
itat destruction) can drastically alter host behavior, which 
in turn affects the circulation patterns of infectious agents 
such as WNV. In this study, we defined the patterns of 
WNV circulation and key areas for surveillance and cor­
related them with the migratory patterns of their primary 
reservoir, terrestrial birds. Although this information does 
not enable prediction of the size of annual WNV outbreaks, 
these advancements support the construction of targeted 
surveillance and vector mitigation strategies to predict the 
annual flow of WNV strains and to enable public health of­
ficials to anticipate changes in WNV circulation resulting 
from altered bird migration.

We assembled a collection of 73 Capnocytophaga cani­
morsus isolates obtained from blood cultures taken from 
patients treated at Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, 
Finland) during 2000–2017. We serotyped these isolates by 
PCR and Western blot and attempted to correlate pathogen 
serovar with patient characteristics. Our analyses showed, 
in agreement with previous research, that 3 C. canimorsus 
serovars (A–C) caused most (91.8%) human infections, de­
spite constituting only 7.6% of isolates found in dogs. The 
3 fatalities that occurred in our cohort were equally repre­
sented by these serovars. We found 2 untypeable isolates, 
which we designated serovars J and K. We did not detect 
an association between serovar and disease severity, im­
mune status, alcohol abuse, or smoking status, but dog 
bites occurred more frequently among patients infected with 
non-A–C serovars. Future research is needed to confirm 
serovar virulence and develop strategies to reduce risk for 
these infections in humans.
C
apnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative, 
rod-shaped, usually commensal bacteria of dog and 
cat oral flora that causes rare but potentially severe in­
fections in humans (1,2). Even with administration of 
adequate antimicrobial therapy, C. canimorsus–induced 
septicemia can progress to a debilitating disease or sep­
tic shock and can cause a mortality rate as high as 30%. 
Annual incidence of C. canimorsus infections has been 
estimated at 0.5–0.67 cases/1 million persons (3,4), but 
in a retrospective study, a prevalence of 4.1 cases/1 mil­
lion persons was estimated (5); this discrepancy prob­
ably resulted from the choice of diagnostics. The clinical 
manifestation of C. canimorsus infection might be mild, 
with influenza-like symptoms and intestinal complaints 
(1), a disease severity not always reaching the threshold 
for a blood culture. Moreover, C. canimorsus is a fas­
tidious and slow-growing organism, rendering its culture 
and isolation difficult (2).
Human exposure to a dog’s oral flora can occur through 
a bite or scratch or even through just being in close prox­
imity to the animal (1,5). Although splenectomy, asplenia, 
alcohol abuse, smoking, and advanced age are often de­
scribed as predisposing factors for severe illness caused by 
this bacterium, up to 40% of patients have no obvious risk 
factor (1); thus, C. canimorsus should not be considered 
exclusively an opportunistic pathogen.
C. canimorsus is enveloped by a lipooligosaccharide 
and a capsule consisting of units of the same O antigen 
but assembled by different polymerases (6). The capsule 
confers to C. canimorsus resistance to the bactericidal ef­
fects of human serum and phagocytosis by macrophages 
(6). One study showed that despite the seemingly vast rep­
ertoire of capsular serovars among C. canimorsus isolates 
from dog mouths, 3 serovars (A, B, and C) are associated 
with most human infections (7). However, this finding was 
from a study carried out with just 25 isolates from patients 
worldwide. To validate this finding, we evaluated the se­
rovars present in a collection of 73 isolates from patients 
treated at Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, Finland) 
during 2000–2017.

RESEARCH
frozen archive of bacterial isolates obtained from pa­
tient blood cultures. For the purposes of this study, we 
searched laboratory records for blood cultures positive 
for C. canimorsus during 2000–2017; a corresponding 
frozen bacteria isolate could be found for 78 patients. Of 
these frozen isolates, we could grow and analyze 73. To 
correlate analyses with clinical data, we searched patient 
journals, electronic patient records, and laboratory da­
tabases for patient characteristics, clinical information, 
and laboratory data. We recorded patient age, sex, con­
current medical conditions, medications administered, 
immune status, lifestyle factors, and type of contact 
with dogs (bitten, contact but not bitten, or not known), 
whenever the information was available. Of the clini­
cal data, we recorded the level of care, length of stay in 
the hospital, complications, 30-day and 1-year mortality 
rates, and registered coagulation and fibrinolysis labora­
tory variables. We analyzed partial thromboplastin time 
according to the Owren method (8).
The Administrative Department of Helsinki Hos­
pital District and Helsinki City College of Social and 
Health Care gave approval for obtaining this data from 
patient medical records. Because only data registers 
were used for acquiring data, obtaining informed con­
sent from patients was waived.
Bacterial Isolates and Growth Conditions
We cultured C. canimorsus bacterial isolates (Table 1) 
obtained from HUSLAB, which were originally obtained 
from blood samples of patients in Finland, as described 
previously (9). In brief, we incubated aerobic and an­
aerobic blood culture bottles with BacT/ALERT 3D (bio­
Mérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) for 6 days or until the 
cultures became positive. We used Gram staining and 
cultivated all positive samples on chocolate agar, fas­
tidious anaerobe agar, or heart infusion agar plates. For 
serotyping, we grew bacteria on heart infusion agar plates 
(BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) supplemented with 
5% sheep blood (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and 20 µg/mL 
gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for 48 
h at 37°C with 5% CO2.
C. canimorsus Identification by 16S rDNA Sequencing
We extracted genomic DNA directly from blood culture 
bottles or by boiling of a single colony (online Tech­
nical Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/12/17-2060-Techapp1.pdf). We used 4 different 
amplification methods involving 8 different primers to se­
quence 16S rDNA from bacterial isolates (online Techni­
cal Appendix Tables 2, 3). When >1 primer was used to 
sequence a PCR product, we obtained the consensus se­
quence using Bioedit (https://bioedit.software.informer.
com), and we analyzed sequences using BLAST (https://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).
Antisera Production and Adsorption
The production of antisera to serovars A–I has previ­
ously been described (7). We produced rabbit polyclonal 
anti-J (against isolate H12) and anti-K (against isolate 
H24) likewise (7). Immunizations were carried out at the 
Centre d’Economie Rurale (Aye, Belgium). The Centre 
d’Economie Rurale animal welfare committee approved 
our animal handling protocols and procedures. We ad­
sorbed anti-J and anti-K sera with a mixture of 25 iso­
lates from patients (Cc1–Cc25; online Technical Appen­
dix Table 4) to obtain polyclonal antibodies specifically 
recognizing J or K capsular serovars. We performed ad­
sorptions by incubating 250 µL of antiserum with 6 × 
109 paraformaldehyde-fixed bacteria on a rotating wheel 
at room temperature for >2 hours. We removed bacteria 
by successive centrifugations. We repeated the incuba­
tions and centrifugations 4 times. We performed capsular

Statistical Analysis
We expressed categorical data as counts and percentages 
and continuous data as medians and interquartile ranges. 
We compared categorical data between groups by Fisher 
exact test. We assumed continuous data were nonnormally 
distributed and analyzed data using Mann-Whitney U-test 
for 2 groups and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test for >3 
groups. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, 
many data points were unavailable for many cases (data 
were more complete for severely ill patients and less com­
plete for mildly ill patients), so we provided the number of 
patients included in each analysis. We considered p val­
ues <0.05 statistically significant and performed analyses 
using SPSS version 22 (https://www.ibm.com/analytics/
spss-statistics-software).
Results
Capsular Typing Collection of 73 Isolates from Finland
We identified the 73 isolates originating from Helsinki 
University Hospital (Table 1) as C. canimorsus through 
16S rDNA sequencing (online Technical Appendix 
Tables 1, 3). We subjected isolates to a PCR designed 
to detect capsular serovars A, B, and C (7); 67 of 73 
isolates were ABC positive (Table 1; online Technical 
Appendix Figure 1). We also typed these 67 strains us­
ing A-, B-, and C-specific PCR tests (7). To validate the 
PCR typing results, we performed Western blot analy­
ses with polysaccharide samples of the 73 isolates using 
antiserum specifically recognizing A, B, or C capsular 
serovars (online Technical Appendix Figure 2). This 
analysis confirmed the PCR typing results and interpre­
tation of all isolates tested, except H27. According to 
Western blot analyses, isolate H27 could be considered 
serovar A or B, but in agreement with the PCR results, 
we considered this isolate a B capsular serovar only. In 
short, 91.8% (67/73) of isolates tested were serovars A 
(n = 17), B (n = 28), or C (n = 22).
We then subjected isolates to PCR analyses for the 
detection of capsular types D and E, which have previ­
ously been detected among C. canimorsus isolates from 
human infections (7). Two isolates were serovar D and 1 
serovar E (online Technical Appendix Figure 1), findings 
that were confirmed by Western blot analyses (Table 1; 
online Technical Appendix Figure 2). We tested the 3 re­
maining nontypeable (non-A–E) isolates by Western blot 
for capsular types F–I, which have only been detected in 
isolates obtained from dogs (7). Isolate H21 was typed as 
serovar I, leaving only 2 strains (H12 and H24) not typed 
of the 73 tested.
We raised rabbit antisera against H12 and H24 bacte­
ria and adsorbed antisera with related bacteria strains. The 
2 new antisera recognized only the capsule of the isolate 
against which they were raised, indicating the 2 isolates be­
longed to 2 new serovars, which we named J and K (online 
Technical Appendix Figure 2). Thus, the 73 C. canimorsus 
isolates from the Helsinki University Hospital collection 
comprised 8 serovars (Figure 1, panel A); A, B, and C dom­
inated (91.8%), consistent with the findings of the previous 
study involving 25 worldwide isolates (Figure 1, panel B) 
(7). The distribution of serovars A (p = 0.071), B (p = 0.47), 
C (p = 0.20), D (p = 0.27), E (p = 0.45), and I–K (p = 1) 
was not significantly different between the 2 collections (all 
p values analyzed by Fisher exact test; Figure 1, panel C).
Screening of Dog Isolates for Capsular Serovars 
J and K
We next tested for the prevalence of the J and K capsu­
lar serovars in a previously described collection of C. 
canimorsus isolates obtained from mouths of healthy dogs 
(7,10). We screened these 52 dog isolates by ELISA using

the antisera we produced. Although no isolates reacted with 
the anti-K serum, isolate CcD35 from a dog in Switzerland 
reacted with the anti-J serum (Figure 1, panel D; online 
Technical Appendix Table 5). We confirmed this result 
by Western blot analysis of the polysaccharidic structures 
(online Technical Appendix Figure 2), which showed that 
capsular serovar J is thus not limited to Finland.
Correlation between Disease Severity and 
Capsular Type
We also tested the association between serovar and disease 
severity. For this investigation, the level of care was used 
as a surrogate; patients treated in a regular ward or who 
had only visited the emergency department were regarded 
as having a mild course of disease, and patients treated in 
a high-dependency or intensive care unit were regarded as 
severely ill. No statistically significant difference could be 
found in the proportions of any serovar between patients 
with mild and severe disease (p = 0.76; Figure 2, panel A). 
Among the 73 cases of C. canimorsus infection included in 
this study, 3 were fatal (Table 2). The isolates from these 
3 patients were serovars A (H80), B (H26), and C (H28). 
Extensive amputations were reported in 6 cases, among 
which included the nonsurviving patient infected with the 
capsular B isolate H26. The 5 other capsular types associ­
ated with amputations were A (n = 2, H48 and H56), B (n 
= 1, H79), and C (n = 2, H46 and H59). Therefore, capsular 
serovars A, B, and C are all capable of causing severe dis­
ease in humans.
We looked for an association between capsular serovar 
and patient immune status or lifestyle factors but found no 
statistically significant link between serovar and immune 
compromised state (p = 0.682), alcohol abuse (p = 0.982), 
or smoking (p = 0.713) (Figure 2, panels B–D). We defined 
patients as immune compromised if they had been on im­
mune suppressive medication or had recently received che­
motherapy, had a concurrent medical condition associated 
with impaired immunity or active cancer, or had undergone 
splenectomy. One of the 2 splenectomized patients had a 
severe course of disease, but both survived.
Severe C. canimorsus infections are often associated 
with purpura or petechiae, disseminated intravascular co­
agulation, and gangrene of extremities (1). In particular, 
coagulation disorders were found to be associated with 
94% of patients having C. canimorsus–induced septic 
shock in a 10-year retrospective study in Helsinki (5). In 
our study, no statistically significant association could be 
found between coagulation and fibrinolysis laboratory 
variables (platelet count, partial thromboplastin time, fi­
brin D-dimers) and capsular serovars (Table 3). Given the 
low number of cases associated with some serovars, we 
could assess only the 3 dominant serovars (A, B, and C). 
We compared coagulation and fibrinolysis disorder mark­
ers between patients with mild and severe clinical course.

C. canimorsus Serovar and Disease Severity
As expected, the analyzed variables were more affected 
in patients with a severe course of infection (Table 3). 
Of note, deviating coagulation and fibrinolysis variables 
were frequently present in patients with mild courses of 
disease, further strengthening the previously reported 
close association of C. canimorsus infection and coagula­
tion disorders.
Correlation between Type of Contact with Dog 
and Capsular Type
The type of contact with dogs did not differ among infec­
tions with any of the dominant serovars, but 4 of the 5 
patients infected with serovar D, E, I, or J had been bitten 
(Figure 2, panel E). The contact type was not known for 
the patient infected with the serovar K isolate, the fifth 
rare serotype.
Discussion
In this study, we analyzed 73 C. canimorsus isolates ob­
tained from patients treated at Helsinki University Hospi­
tal. All isolates were serotyped and found to be endowed 
with a capsular polysaccharide (CPS), further confirming 
the commonality of the presence of a CPS in C. canimor­
sus isolates (6,7). We confirmed the high prevalence of 
capsular serovars A, B, and C among isolates from human 
infections; 67 (91.8%) of 73 isolates were typed as 1 of 
these 3 serovars. No significant difference was found in the 
prevalence of these serovars between this collection of 73 
isolates from Finland and a previously studied collection of 
25 isolates obtained from cases worldwide (7). Among the 
98 C. canimorsus isolates from these 2 studies, 89 (90.8%) 
were capsular types A, B, or C. Our data confirmed that se­
rovars A, B, and C are significantly more common among 
clinical isolates than dog isolates (4/52; 7.6%), suggesting 
these serovars are more virulent than the others. Our data 
also confirmed that serovars A, B, and C are present in dif­
ferent geographic areas.
Besides the A, B, and C serovars, the Helsinki collec­
tion contained 2 other serovars: 2 isolates of serovar D and 
1 of serovar E. This observation is of high interest because 
serovars D and E were previously isolated from patients in 
the United States (n = 1), Belgium (n = 1), and Switzerland 
(n = 1) (7). Thus, although serovars D and E represent only 
4.1% and 2%, respectively, of the total clinical isolates in 
this study, these serovars should be considered virulent and 
taken into account in prophylaxis.
One patient in our cohort was infected with a se­
rovar I strain. This serovar had not been encountered 
before among humans but was found in dogs (1 in Bel­
gium and 1 in Switzerland) (7). These findings suggest 
that not only serovars A–E but also rare serovars are 
widely distributed.
Last, we describe 2 new capsular serovars, J and K, 
each with a limited (1%) prevalence in human infections. 
We tested these 2 new antisera against our collection of iso­
lates obtained from dogs in Switzerland and Belgium (10) 
and found 1 C. canimorsus isolate had a J-type CPS. Thus, 
using the 11 antisera we have that are specific to serovars

RESEARCH
A–K, which identified 98 human clinical isolates, we can 
only type 36.5% (19/52) of our collection of dog isolates 
from Switzerland and Belgium. This finding, again, rein­
forces the hypothesis of the existence of a large repertoire 
of CPS serovars in C. canimorsus among dog isolates.
Because C. canimorsus extensively deglycosylates hu­
man N-linked glycoproteins from cell surfaces (11–13), a 
given blood group might be a predisposing factor for C. 
canimorsus infection, but further research is needed to in­
vestigate an association between blood type and serovar. 
Blood group information was available for 55 patients 
in our cohort, and we found no enrichment in any blood 
groups among patients infected with C. canimorsus com­
pared with the blood group distribution of the population 
of (data not shown).
The availability of clinical records associated with 
the isolates typed in this study gave us the opportunity to 
investigate the link between capsular serovar and disease 
severity, patient immune status, lifestyle, or type of contact 
with dogs. When comparing the most prevalent capsular 
types (A, B, and C) found in these 73 clinical isolates, we 
found no significant correlation between disease severity 
and capsular type. In the previous C. canimorsus capsular 
typing study, the authors suggested that strains belonging 
to capsular types of lower prevalence, like D and E, might 
preferentially infect immunocompromised patients (7); we 
could not draw such a conclusion here. In addition, alcohol 
abuse or smoking status could not be linked to infection 
by a specific capsular type. Alcohol abuse, smoking status, 
and immune suppression all were not significantly associ­
ated with disease severity or the 30-day mortality rate (data 
not shown), although the relatively low sample size and 
missing data preclude us from drawing conclusions regard­
ing this matter.
The capsular serovars less frequently isolated in hu­
man infections, such as E, I, and J, were mainly found in 
patients who had been bitten, which could suggest that 
these serovars are less virulent than serovars A–D, perhaps 
requiring a deeper inoculation to provoke an infection. Un­
fortunately, the information on dog exposure was missing 
for the patient infected with the serovar K strain.
Two patients included in this study were reportedly 
bitten on the same day by the same dog. The isolates from 
these 2 patients (H44 and H46) were both typed as capsu­
lar serovar C, suggesting that the same strain infected both 
patients. The 2 patients had a severe form of the infection, 
requiring treatment in an intensive care unit. This observa­
tion of 2 patients being infected by the same dog has not 
been reported previously and gives an indication of the epi­
demiology of disease.
The observation of so few cases of C. canimorsus in­
fection is indeed striking, considering that up to 74% of 
dogs carry C. canimorsus bacteria (14). We hypothesize 
that only a few C. canimorsus strains are virulent in hu­
mans, and few dogs carry these dangerous strains. In­
deed, the 3 most prevalent serovars in human infection 
(A–C), represent only 7.6% of the C. canimorsus iso­
lates from dogs (7), suggesting that a minority of dogs 
represent a risk for humans. This disease might be pre­
ventable in humans by identifying the dogs that carry 
these dangerous serotypes and specifically vaccinating 
them to eliminate the pathogen or drastically reduce 
pathogen shedding.

rom the Greek kapnos (“smoke”) for its dependence on carbon dioxide, which is a large 
component of smoke, Capnocytophaga canimorsus (Latin canis, “dog,” and morsus, “bite”) 
are gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that are part of the normal 
oral microbiota of dogs and cats. The genus was proposed to distinguish these bacteria from 
Cytophaga spp. (Greek kytos, “cell,” and phagein, “eat”), which also exhibit gliding motility. 
C. canimorsus was previously known as CDC group DF-2 (dysgonic fermenter type 2) and was 
first isolated from a 
man who had ex­
perienced multiple 
dog bites and devel­
oped septicemia and 
meningitis. C. cani­
morsus remains a 
major cause of sep­
ticemia in persons, 
particularly 
those 
who are asplenic 
or immunocompro­
mised, who are bit­
ten by dogs or cats.

During 2013–2014, we collected 1,926 serum samples from 
humans and 4,583 ticks (Hyalomma asiaticum or Derma­
centor nuttalli) in select regions of Mongolia to determine the 
risk for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) 
infection among humans in this country. Testing of human 
serum samples by ELISA demonstrated an overall CCHFV 
antibody prevalence of 1.4%; Bayankhongor Province had 
the highest prevalence, 2.63%. We pooled and analyzed 
tick specimens by real-time reverse transcription PCR; 1 
CCHFV-positive H. asiaticum tick pool from Ömnögovi was 
identified. In phylogenetic analyses, the virus’s partial small 
segment clustered with CCHFV isolates from Central Asia, 
and the complete medium segment grouped with CCHFV 
isolates from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This study 
confirms CCHFV endemicity in Mongolia and provides in­
formation on risk for CCHFV infection. Further research is 
needed to better define the risk for CCHFV disease to im­
prove risk mitigation, diagnostics, and surveillance.
C
rimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick­
borne disease of humans that is prevalent over a wide 
geographic area, spanning from western China to southern 
Asia, from the Middle East to southeastern Europe, and over 
most of Africa (1–3). The causative agent is Crimean-Congo 
hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a member of the Bun­
yaviridae family and Orthonairovirus genus. The enveloped 
virus has a negative-sense RNA genome composed of 3 am­
bisense segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L). The 
S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein and the L seg­
ment the viral polymerase. The M segment encodes a glyco­
protein precursor that is processed into 2 glycoproteins by 
the host cell. Genetic drift and segment reassortment of the 
CCHFV genome results in a high degree of phylogeographic 
diversity, with 5–7 designated genotypes (2,4).
CCHFV is maintained in the environment in a cycle 
between tick vectors, primarily Hyalomma ticks, and wild 
and domesticated animals. Birds generally appear to be re­
fractory to CCHFV infection, although some avian species 
demonstrate infectivity (5). Widespread dispersion is most 
likely mediated by infected ticks carried by migrating birds 
or moving livestock (1,6–8). Viremia in mammals is tran­
sient, but ticks remain infected throughout their lives (9). 
The human species is considered a dead-end host because 
virus transmission from infected humans to uninfected 
feeding ticks has not been reported. Humans can become 
infected when fed on by infected ticks, exposed to infec­
tious bodily fluids during animal slaughter, or caring for 
infected patients (1,10). Infection can result in an unappar­
ent or mild disease of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, head­
ache, and body pains. In severe cases, hemorrhagic disease 
is characterized by petechial rashes of the skin, bleeding 
from mucosal membranes and muscles, organ failure, and 
cerebral hemorrhage. Mortality rates have been estimated 
to be 5%–30% but have reached as high as 80% in some 
outbreaks (10). One report describes CCHF survivors as 
having lasting effects, including prolonged vision and 
memory problems (11).
CCHFV prevalence in Mongolia is generally un­
known. No published studies provide evidence of human 
infection or of virus circulating in tick vectors. A previous 
study in the Mongolia aimag (i.e., province) of Arkhan­
gai demonstrated serologic evidence of virus infection in 
1.8% of wildlife species tested (12), and a large study in­
volving >2,000 samples collected from sheep demonstrat­
ed a CCHFV seroprevalence of 27.1% among sheep from 
multiple aimags across Mongolia (13). Furthermore, nu­
merous CCHFV strains have been identified in Xinjiang 
Province, a region of China bordering Mongolia (14–16). 
Serologic evidence of CCHFV infections in wildlife and 
livestock suggests the virus circulates in Mongolia and 
that CCHFV infections are possible for persons exposed 
to biting ticks or infectious tissues or fluids. In this study, 
we sought to better characterize the risk for CCHFV in­
fection among the population of Mongolia by determining 
antibody prevalence in humans associated with livestock

Materials and Methods
Human Samples
During 2013–2014, we collected serum samples (n = 1,926) 
from persons in regions corresponding to the estimated 
geographic distribution of Hyalomma asiaticum ticks (17); 
we collected most samples in 2013. We collected samples 
from Dornod Aimag in eastern Mongolia; Dornogovi 
Aimag, Dundgovi Aimag, Ömnögovi Aimag, Bayankhon­
gor Aimag, and Govi-Altai Aimag in southern Mongolia 
(the Gobi Desert landscapes); and Khovd Aimag in west­
ern Mongolia (Table 1; Figure 1). We collected blood from 
nomadic herders and local residents of both sexes from the 
selected regions by using standard blood sampling tech­
niques. We centrifuged and stored serum samples at –20°C 
until transporting them to the National Center for Zoonotic 
Diseases (Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia), where samples were 
stored at −70°C. We collected all human samples in ac­
cordance with Mongolia Ministry of Health–approved pro­
tocols and tested all human samples at the US Army Medi­
cal Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) 
under approved human use protocol FY11–14.
IgG ELISA
We detected human CCHFV IgG by sandwich ELISA. We 
coated Immulon 2 HB plates (ThermoFisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA) with anti-CCHFV hyperimmune 
mouse ascitic fluid (1:1,000) in phosphate-buffered saline 
and 0.01% thimerosal. After incubating plates overnight 
at 4°C and washing 3 times with wash buffer (phosphate-
buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 and 0.01% thimero­
sal), we added 100 µL of inactivated CCHFV IbAr10200 
supernatant (IgG capture antigen) or noninfected Vero E6 
cell supernatant (negative control) diluted (1:20) in milk 
buffer (wash buffer plus 5% skim milk) to each well. We 
incubated plates for 60 min at 37°C, washed 3 times with 
wash buffer, and added serum samples diluted 1:100 in 
milk buffer to test wells and negative control wells. We 
incubated plates for 60 min at 37°C, washed 3 times with 
wash buffer, and added 100 µL of the detector antibody 
(horseradish peroxidase–labeled anti-human IgG Fc; Accu­
rate Chemical and Scientific, Westbury, NY, USA) diluted 
1:8,000 in milk buffer to all wells. We incubated plates for 
60 min at 37°C, washed 3 times with wash buffer, and de­
veloped using 100 µL of substrate 2, 2’-azino-di-(3-ethyl­
benzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) with a 30-min incubation at 
37°C. We read plates using a TECAN Infinite M200 Pro 
(Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland) plate reader 
at 405 nm and determined the optical density (OD) for each 
well. We calculated the adjusted OD for each sample by 
subtracting the average OD value of the Vero cell super­
natant control wells from the average OD value of the IgG 
capture antigen wells. The positive-negative cutoff of each 
assay was the mean OD value plus 3 SDs of the 4 negative 
control samples (typically 0.2).
Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test
For the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), we 
diluted all test samples 1:10 in minimum essential media 
(MEM) with 5% heat-inactivated Hyclone Fetal Bovine 
Serum (FBS) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, 
PA, USA) and then placed samples in a 56°C water bath 
for 30 min. For test and positive control serum samples, we 
2-fold serially diluted to 1:320 in MEM with 5% FBS. For 
negative control serum samples, we 2-fold serially diluted 
to 1:40 in the same buffer. We diluted CCHFV IbAr10200 
in MEM with 5% FBS to a concentration of 1,000 plaque-
forming units/mL.

RESEARCH
We mixed positive control, negative control, and test 
serum samples with virus 1:1 in microtiter tubes, covered 
tubes with parafilm, and then placed them at 37°C for 1 
h. We incubated 200 µL of serum-virus mixture in dupli­
cate wells of 6-well plates with SW-13 cells grown to a 
minimum of 85% confluence. We incubated plates at 37°C 
with 5% CO2 for 1 h with gentle rocking every 15 min. 
After incubation, we added 2 mL of 0.5% agar overlay (2× 
basal medium Eagle with Earle salts with 10% FBS, 1% 
penicillin-streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% nones­
sential amino acids) to each well and incubated at 37°C for 
≈36 h. Then, we added a second 0.5% agar overlay contain­
ing 5% neutral red to each well, incubated at 37°C for 4–5 
h, and counted plaques. We reported the reciprocal of the 
highest serum dilutions reducing 50% (PRNT50) and 80% 
(PRNT80) of the plaque assay dose as the titer and calcu­
lated the probit titer.
Tick Collections and Processing
We collected ticks from livestock and questing ticks from 
the environment in the same regions of Mongolia where 
we collected human serum samples. During the spring and 
early summer, we collected adult, unfed ticks by the drag 
cloth method (dragging a cotton cloth on a dowel) and by 
removing ticks from livestock with forceps. We placed 
each collection in a centrifuge tube with a moist cotton. 
In the field, we stored tick collections in portable thermal 
coolers at 4°C. We sent ticks to the National Center for 
Zoonotic Diseases, where samples were stored at –20°C 
until species identification was completed. Afterward, we 
transferred ticks to −70°C storage until shipment to US­
AMRIID for processing. We collected 4,583 ticks for pro­
cessing, of which 1,772 were H. asiaticum and 2,811 were 
Dermacentor nuttalli.
We sorted field-collected unfed specimens by sex and 
species and placed ticks in pairs into single polycarbonate 
vials containing prepared media and 3/8-inch steel balls. 
We homogenized ticks using the 1600 MiniG Automated 
Tissue Homogenizer and Cell Lyser (SPEX SamplePrep, 
Metuchen, NJ, USA), combined portions of homogenized 
subpools into larger pools (maximum 8 ticks/pool), and 
treated them with TRIzol LS (ThermoFisher Scientific) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We purified 
total nucleic acid using the KingFisher Flex Purification 
System (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the MagMax 96 
for MicroArrays Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher 
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s recommenda­
tions. We stored all tick pools and processed nucleic acids 
at −70°C until needed for testing.
Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR
We tested total nucleic acid extracted from tick pools for 
the CCHFV S segment using a real-time reverse transcrip­
tion PCR (RT-PCR) assay optimized for CCHFV sequence 
diversity (18,19). We performed this assay in triplicate in 
wells of 384-well plates using the SuperScript III One-Step 
RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 2.5 µL 
of sample in 10-µL reactions run on the LightCycler 480 
(Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Cycling 
conditions were 50°C for 15 min; 95°C for 5 min; and 45

cycles of 94°C for 1 s, 55°C for 20 s, and 68°C for 5 s. 
Fluorescence was measured after each extension step. We 
considered a sample negative if the quantification cycle 
was >40 cycles.
Nested RT-PCR
To confirm real-time RT-PCR results, we performed nested 
RT-PCR targeting the CCHFV S segment as previously de­
scribed (20). In brief, we used 15 µL of extracted tick ho­
mogenate and SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System 
with Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Invi­
trogen) in a 50-µL reaction with outer primers CCHF-F2 
(5′-TGGACACCTTCACAAACTC-3′), CCHF-F2C (5′-TG­
GATACTTTCACAAACTC-3′), and CCHF-R3 (5′-GA­
CAAATTCCCTGCACCA-3′). Cycling conditions were 
42°C for 30 min; 94°C for 5 min; 5 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 
37°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; 72°C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 
94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s; and a final cycle 
of 72°C for 5 min. We assessed for the presence of amplicons 
(536 bp) by performing electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels.
We performed nested PCR with 1 µL of amplicon as 
template in a 50-µL reaction with inner primers CCHF-
F3 (5′-GAATGTGCATGGGTTAGCTC-3′), CCHF-F3C 
(5′-GAGTGTGCCTGGGTTAGCTC-3′), 
CCHF-R2a 
(5′-GACATCACAATTTCACCAGG-3′), and CCHF-R2b 
(5′-GACATTACAATTTCGCCAGG-3′). Cycling condi­
tions were 94°C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C 
for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s; and 72°C for 5 min. We assessed 
for the presence of amplicons (260 bp) by performing elec­
trophoresis on 2% agarose gels.
CCHFV Sequencing and Analysis
We performed a second RT-PCR with S segment outer 
primers with the only tick pool that was positive by real-
time and nested RT-PCR (159A). We then used 5 µL of the 
reaction for Sanger sequencing. We ran the amplicon (536 
bp, near 5′ end of S segment) through a 2% agarose gel, cut 
the band out, and purified the amplicon using the QIAquick 
Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Desseldorf, Germany). We 
created sequencing libraries using the BigDye Terminator 
v3.1 Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, 
CA, USA) with 10 µL of the purified amplicon in a 20-µL 
reaction. Cycling conditions were 96°C for 1 min and 25 
cycles of 96°C for 10 s, 50°C for 5 s, and 60°C for 4 min. 
We sequenced libraries using the 3500xL Genetic Analyzer 
(Applied Biosystems).
We attempted to amplify CCHFV segments L, M, 
and S from tick pool 159A using segment-specific primers 
modified for Nextera-based sequencing (Table 2) (21,22); 
however, only the M segment amplified. In brief, we used 
5 µL of extracted nucleic acid from tick homogenate to re­
verse transcribe the genome and amplify the cDNA of the 
M segment using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR 
System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase 
(Invitrogen). Cycling conditions were 52.5°C for 30 min; 
94°C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 50.5°C for 30 s, 
and 68°C for 1 min/kb; and 68°C for 5 min. We ran the am­
plified M segment through an agarose gel and purified the 
band using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN).
We generated next-generation sequencing libraries 
using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illu­
mina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufactur­
er’s instructions and sequenced using the 500-cycle MiSeq 
Reagent Kit v2 (Illumina). We analyzed sequencing reads 
with the CLC Genomics Workbench (QIAGEN), filtered 
and trimmed them for quality, and assembled the complete 
M segment de novo. We generated the final consensus se­
quence by remapping the trimmed reads to the de novo 
consensus sequence as previously described (22).
We identified the full-length M segment sequence 
and partial S segment sequence from tick pool 159A by 
BLAST analysis (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). 
We aligned the segments from tick pool 159A with the 
available full-length M and near–full-length S segments in 
GenBank and generated a neighbor-joining phylogenetic 
tree (Jukes-Cantor model) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Virus Isolation
To propagate virus in the RT-PCR–positive tick pool, we 
thawed 60 µL of tick homogenates and mixed with 6 mL 
of freshly prepared MEM with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential 
amino acids, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 
and 0.4% fungizone. We inoculated confluent monolayers 
of SW-13 cells in 2 T75 flasks with 2.5 mL of the virus

mixture and incubated at 37°C for 1 h; then, we added an 
additional 30 mL of MEM. We incubated flasks at 37°C 
with 5% CO2 for 1 wk or until cytopathic effects (CPE) 
were evident. To test for unapparent infections (i.e., infec­
tions not resulting in CPE), each inoculated culture was 
tested by real-time RT-PCR as previously described.
Results
CCHFV Serologic Testing in Humans
To assess the overall risk for CCHFV infection in Mongo­
lia, we tested 1,926 serum samples collected from nomadic 
herders and local residents in select regions of the country 
by ELISA. In total, 27 samples tested positive for CCH­
FV IgG; the overall prevalence rate was 1.4% (Table 1). 
Bayankhongor Aimag had the highest prevalence (2.63%); 
other aimags with CCHFV IgG–positive populations had 
prevalences of 2.07% (Dornogovi), 1.42% (Ömnögovi), 
and 1.19% (Govi-Altai). The remaining 3 aimags tested 
(Khovd, Dundgovi, and Dornod) showed no evidence of 
CCHFV IgG.
We evaluated 12 positive and 7 randomly selected 
negative samples for their ability to neutralize CCHFV 
strain IbAr10200 (Table 3). In total, 8 (67%) of 12 ELI­
SA-positive samples and 2 (29%) of 7 ELISA-negative 
samples neutralized CCHFV with PRNT50 probit titers; 5 
samples with PRNT50 probit titers (3 ELISA-positive and 2 
ELISA-negative) had PRNT80 probit titers. Neutralization 
ability did not correlate with ELISA OD values.
Molecular Testing for CCHFV in Ticks
We collected questing ticks and ticks from livestock and 
identified and pooled them on the basis of tick species, sex, 
and geographic location; then, we screened tick pools by 
real-time RT-PCR using a broad CCHFV assay (19). Of 
the 893 tick pools tested, 1 pool (159A) tested positive by 
real-time RT-PCR and was confirmed CCHFV positive 
by nested RT-PCR; results for 6 other pools were indeter­
minate. Tick pool 159A, which contained 7 H. asiaticum 
ticks, was collected in the soum (i.e., district) Nomgon in 
Ömnögovi Aimag.
Characterization of CCHFV-Positive Pool 159A
To genetically characterize the CCHFV detected in tick 
pool 159A, we amplified and sequenced the full-length 
M segment and partial S segment. BLAST analysis of the 
nucleocapsid coding region located within the partial S 
segment identified K128_76 (GenBank no. KX013455.1) 
from Kazakhstan as the CCHFV isolate having the great­
est percent identity at 98%, and IbAr10200, the prototypi­
cal CCHFV isolate, had a percent identity of 87%. BLAST 
analysis of the M segment identified SPU 97/85 (GenBank 
accession no. DQ211633.1) from South Africa as the 
CCHFV isolate having the highest percent identity at 91%, 
with IbAr10200 having a percent identity of 81%. Phyloge­
netic analysis indicated that the partial S segment sequence 
clusters within the Asia 2 lineage (Figure 2), which con­
tains virus strains from China and Russia (23). CCHFV M 
segments in general do not cluster well by geographic lo­
cation on phylogenetic analyses; the M segment sequence 
tick 159A/Mongolia clustered with CCHFV strains from 
Asia, Africa, and the Middle East (Figure 3).
Virus Isolation
Attempts to isolate CCHFV from putative PCR-positive 
tick pools in SW-13 culture cells were made from multiple 
tick homogenate subpools (N = 18), containing 2 ticks per 
subpool. None of the inoculated cultures showed evidence 
of virus growth by visible CPE or genomic signature by 
real-time RT-PCR in either the first or second passages.
Discussion
To better determine the risk for CCHFV infection among 
humans in Mongolia, we conducted an assessment that in­
cluded a CCHFV IgG serosurvey and screening for CCH­
FV RNA in ticks collected in parallel with the serosurvey. 
Overall, this study provides evidence that CCHFV is cir­
culating in H. asiaticum ticks and humans in Mongolia, 
provides sequence data on a virus circulating in the region, 
and extends the geographic distribution of CCHFV north 
to Mongolia.
Previous studies conducted in Mongolia revealed se­
rologic evidence of CCHFV in wildlife species and live­
stock. Chumikhin et al. found serologic evidence for CCH­
FV infection in small mammals, such as the Tolai hare, 
Mongolian pika, and long-tailed ground squirrel (12,13). 
Livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, are am­
plifying hosts of the virus, and CCHFV infections in live­
stock correlate with the risk for infection of humans (24). 
Morikawa investigated CCHFV IgG seroprevalence in 
sheep in the southern aimags of Mongolia and found preva­
lences of 7%–28% (13). Evidence of CCHFV in wildlife 
and livestock in Mongolia suggests the possibility of virus 
circulation and human disease, but the actual occurrence 
was unclear.
We found an overall CCHFV IgG seroprevalence of 
1.4% in Mongolia; Bayankhongor Aimag had the highest 
rate, 2.63%. Each soum tested within Bayankhongor had 
IgG prevalences >2%, suggesting a persistent source of 
CCHFV infection is likely present in these soums. Bayank­
hongor is located in the southwestern part of the country 
and has an economy based on livestock, meat, and wool 
production. The greater interaction with animals among 
persons of this aimag could partially explain the higher an­
tibody prevalence in the population. Dornogovi Aimag had 
the next highest antibody prevalence (2.07%). Dornogovi

Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Mongolia
is in the southeastern part of Mongolia and lies in the east­
ern part of the Gobi Desert. Raising livestock previously 
was the main economic driver of this aimag, but this activ­
ity has been replaced by mineral exploration. Soums Kha­
tanbulag and Khövsgöl within Dornogovi had some of the 
highest CCHFV antibody prevalences of those sampled.
Ömnögovi Aimag had an antibody prevalence of 
1.42%, despite having the greatest number of samples test­
ed and being the only aimag having a soum with a CCH­
FV-positive tick pool sample. Ömnögovi, the largest aimag 
in Mongolia, is located in the southern part of the country 
and southern part of the Gobi Desert. Ömnögovi is rich in 
mineral deposits and depends heavily on mining, and agri­
culture is of minor importance. The lowest antibody prev­
alence, 1.19%, occurred in the Govi-Altai Aimag, where 
the Gobi Desert, steppe grasslands, and mountains of west­
ern Mongolia converge. No CCHFV IgG was found in 
samples tested from the other 3 aimags, Khovd, Dundgovi, 
and Dornod. Dornod Aimag is outside the Hyalomma tick 
range, and thus, we did not expect to find evidence of CCH­
FV infection in this area.
Antibody neutralization tests were used to confirm 
the IgG ELISA data because antibody-mediated virus 
neutralization suggests specificity to the tested virus. We 
found that 67% of the ELISA-positive samples tested 
neutralized CCHFV IbAr10200. Because we used an iso­
late from West Africa in our PRNT, our results are prob­
ably an underestimate of the true percentage of samples 
specific for CCHFV. Nucleic acid differences could ac­
count for the reduced neutralization. On the other hand, 
ELISA-positive, PRNT-negative samples could indicate 
exposure to related viruses, such as Dugbe virus. Two of 
7 randomly selected ELISA-negative samples neutralized 
CCHFV to some extent, which could have been the result

of nonspecific binding or low IgG concentrations below 
the level of detection of our ELISA.
As further supporting evidence suggesting CCHFV 
circulation in Mongolia, we identified 1 tick pool positive 
for CCHFV genetic material, which enabled us to sequence 
the S and M segments of the isolate and perform phyloge­
netic analyses. The S segment, which generally clusters on 
the basis of geographic location in phylogenetic analyses, 
was similar to other sequenced CCHFV isolates found in 
countries of Central and East Asia, including Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China, corresponding to the 
Asia 2 CCHFV lineage or lineage IV (21,23). The M seg­
ment, which has a higher mutation rate than the S segment, 
had the greatest homology to isolates from South Africa, 
the Middle East, and Asia, corresponding to the M segment 
lineage IV (21,23).
Overall, our study demonstrated the presence of CCH­
FV in Mongolia, suggesting human infections are occurring 
in the area. Our findings are not surprising, considering that 
others have shown by serology and tick testing the pres­
ence of CCHFV in the region (15,25). Because of Mon­
golia’s size and diversity, additional studies are required 
to better characterize the virus and the disease severity it 
causes. Taken together, these data suggest CCHFV is likely 
endemic in Mongolia. Further investigations are needed to 
better define the risk for human infection and the genomic 
diversity of CCHFV in the region to improve risk mitiga­
tion, diagnostics, and surveillance.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) persists in cervid popula­
tions of North America and in 2016 was detected for the first 
time in Europe in a wild reindeer in Norway. We report the 
detection of CWD in 3 moose (Alces alces) in Norway, iden­
tified through a large-scale surveillance program. The cases 
occurred in 13–14-year-old female moose, and we detected 
an abnormal form of prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain but not 
in lymphoid tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 
the moose shared the same neuropathologic phenotype, 
characterized by mostly intraneuronal deposition of PrPSc. 
This pattern differed from that observed in reindeer and 
has not been previously reported in CWD-infected cervids. 
Moreover, Western blot revealed a PrPSc type distinguish­
able from previous CWD cases and from known ruminant 
prion diseases in Europe, with the possible exception of 
sheep CH1641. These findings suggest that these cases in 
moose represent a novel type of CWD.
T
ransmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), 
or prion diseases, are fatal and transmissible neuro­
degenerative diseases that include scrapie in sheep and 
goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, 
chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids, and Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease in humans. TSEs are characterized by the 
misfolding of the normal host-encoded cellular prion protein 
(PrPC) into an abnormal disease-associated isoform (PrPSc). 
PrPSc is considered to be the main or exclusive component 
of prions, the transmissible agents for TSEs (1). TSEs might 
have a genetic, infectious, or sporadic origin. Classical scra­
pie and CWD can be highly contagious, spreading directly 
among animals or through environmental contamination.
Since its first description in Colorado in 1967, CWD 
has been detected in new geographic areas and with in­
creasing prevalence in captive and free-ranging cervids. 
Currently, the disease has been diagnosed in 25 states in the 
United States and in 2 Canada provinces (2,3), along with 
cases in South Korea associated with importation of in­
fected cervids from Canada (4). High disease prevalence in 
some areas represents a challenge for preservation of wild 
cervids and mitigation of human exposure to CWD-related 
prions (PrPSc). The high prevalence might be a plausible 
explanation for local deer population decline (5,6).
Species naturally affected by CWD include white-tailed 
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (O. hemionus), 
moose (Alces alces), elk or wapiti (Cervus canadensis), and 
red deer (C. elaphus). In 2016, CWD was reported for the 
first time in Europe in wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) (7), 
a species never previously found to be naturally infected. 
The biochemical analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC) 
distribution of PrPSc from Norway reindeer revealed a pat­
tern indistinguishable from North America isolates (7).
We report 3 cases of CWD detected in moose in Nor­
way, characterized by biochemical and IHC features clear­
ly different from CWD cases previously described in North 
America and Norway. Our findings suggest the involve­
ment of a different type of CWD prion.

emaciated and demonstrated abnormal behavior, showing 
reduced fear of humans. The second case, moose no. 2 
(ID P153), was found dead in a river. Necropsy revealed 
normal body condition and pregnancy with twins; trauma 
was the cause of death. The third case, moose no. 3 (ID 
CD11399), was observed showing abnormal behaviors, 
including reduced fear of humans. Necropsy revealed a 
poor body condition and a severe dislocation of the left 
hip joint, which might have influenced the animal’s be­
havior. All 3 were older female moose (13, 14, and 13 
years old, based on counts of cementum annuli in the root 
of the first incisor [8]).
Samples included in this study are described in the 
Table. We performed the primary diagnostic test (TeSeE 
ELISA; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) 
for detection of protease-resistant core of PrPSc (PrPres) on 
the 3 moose and 1 reindeer from Norway (7) in the medulla 
oblongata at the level of the obex. After the initial positive 
test results, the remaining brain tissues were divided; one  
half was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and the 
other half was frozen. In addition, lymph nodes (Ln) from 
moose no. 1 (retropharyngeal, submandibular, and jejunal 
Ln), moose no. 3 (retropharyngeal, parotid, prescapular, 
and submandibular Ln, and tonsils), and the reindeer (2 tra­
cheobronchial Ln) were equally divided and formalin fixed 
or frozen.
Genotyping of Moose PRNP
DNA was extracted from 100 mg of brain tissue by us­
ing a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, 
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The PRNP coding sequence was amplified in a 50 µL fi­
nal volume by using 5 µL of extracted DNA, eluate 1X 
AmpliTaq Gold 360 PCR Buffer (Life Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1X 360 GC 
Enhancer (Life Technologies), 200 µmol/L dNTPs, 0.25 
µmol/L of forward (5′-GCTGACACCCTCTTTATTTT­
GCAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GATTAAGAAGATAAT­
GAAAACAGGAAG -3′) primers (11), and 0.5 µL Am­
pliTaq Gold 360 (Life Technologies), according to the 
following amplification protocol: 5 min at 96°C; 30 s at 
96°C; 15 s at 57°C; 90 s at 72°C for 40 cycles; and 4 min 
at 72°C. Amplicons were purified with the Illustra Exo­
ProStar 1-Step clean-up kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, 
Little Chalfont, UK), sequenced using the Big Dye Ter­
minator Cycle Sequencing Kit v1.1 (Life Technologies), 
and purified with the Big Dye XTerminator Purification 
Kit (Life Technologies), and detected by using an ABI 
PRISM 3130 apparatus (Life Technologies). 
Anti–Prion Protein Monoclonal Antibodies
Several  antibodies with different epitopes (sheep prion 
protein [PrP] numbering) were used for discriminatory 
Western blot (WB) and IHC. SAF84 (aa 167–173) was 
obtained from Bertin Pharma (Montigny-le-Bretonneux, 
France), L42 (aa 148–153) from R-Biopharm (Darmstadt, 
Germany), 9A2 (aa 102–104) and 12B2 (aa 93–97) from 
Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (Lelystad, Nether­
lands), and F99/97.6 (aa 220–225) from VMRD, Inc. (Pull­
man, WA, USA).
Immunohistochemistry
Brain, Ln, and tonsil tissues were formalin fixed for >48 h 
and processed by standard histopathologic techniques. We 
used IHC to visualize the distribution of PrPSc as previous­
ly described (7). We applied a commercially available kit

(EnVisionTM + System HRP [(AEC)] DAKO, Glostrup, 
Denmark) by using the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
12B2, 9A2, L42, SAF 84, or F99/97.6 for 30 min at 37°C 
and counterstained with hematoxylin. In each run, tissues 
from CWD-negative moose and reindeer were added as 
negative controls.
PrPres Detection
We initially tested the obex samples by using the TeSeE 
SAP ELISA and confirmed positive ELISA results by us­
ing the TeSeE WB. Both tests were performed as recom­
mended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad).
Typing of PrPres
We performed further characterization of PrPres by discrim­
inatory immunoblotting, according to the ISS discrimina­
tory WB method (12). Brain homogenates at 10% (wt/vol) 
in 100 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) 2% sarkosyl were incu­
bated for 1 h at 37°C with Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, Missouri, USA) to a final concentration of 200 
µg/mL. Protease treatment was stopped with 3 mmol/L 
PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich). Aliquots of samples were added 
with an equal volume of isopropanol/butanol (1:1 vol/vol) 
and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were 
resuspended in denaturing sample buffer (NuPAGE LDS 
Sample Buffer; Life Technologies) and heated for 10 min 
at 90°C.
We loaded each sample onto 12% bis-Tris polyacryl­
amide gels (Invitrogen) for electrophoresis with subse­
quent WB on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using the 
Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The blots were processed 
with anti-PrP mAbs by using the SNAP i.d. 2.0 system 
(Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) according to the man­
ufacturer’s instructions. After incubation with horserad­
ish peroxidase–conjugated anti–mouse immunoglobulin 
(Pierce Biotechnology, Waltham, MA, USA) at 1:20,000, 
the PrP bands were detected by using enhanced chemilu­
minescent substrate (SuperSignal Femto; Pierce Biotech­
nology) and ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). The 
chemiluminescence signal was quantified by using Image 
Lab 5.2.1 (Bio-Rad).
We performed deglycosylation by adding 18 μL of 0.2 
mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.8% 
Nonidet P40 (Roche) and 2 μL (80 U/ml) di N-Glycosidase 
F (Roche) to 5 μL of proteinase K–digested and denatur­
ated samples. We then incubated the mixtures for 3 h at 
37°C with gentle shaking.
Results
CWD was diagnosed in 2 moose in May 2016 in 
Norway’s Selbu municipality and in 1 moose in Octo­
ber 2017 in Lierne municipality. Selbu and Lierne are 
respectively located ≈300 and ≈450 km northeast of Nord­
fjella, where CWD in reindeer was detected in 2016. Nor­
way is populated by several species of wild cervids with 
varying degrees of overlapping range. Seasonal migrations 
are common and distances might exceed 150 km (13–15). 
However, studies tracking global positioning satellite–
collared moose have not documented regular season­
al migrations between Selbu and Lierne municipali­
ties, suggesting that these can be considered different 
moose subpopulations.
We initially detected PrPSc in brain samples by using 
a rapid test and then confirmed by WB (data not shown) 
and IHC. Sequencing analysis of the entire PrP coding se­
quence revealed that the 3 moose had the wild type PrP 
genotype, homozygous for lysine at codon 109 and for me­
thionine at codon 209 (KK109MM209) (GenBank accession 
no. MH230115).
Discriminatory PrPSc Immunohistochemistry Show 
Differences between Reindeer and Moose
The distribution of PrPSc staining was examined by IHC and 
compared in the tissues of the 3 moose and the reindeer by 
using 5 different antibodies (Figure 1). No staining was ob­
served in CWD-negative reindeer and moose independently 
of the antibody used. The distribution of PrPSc in the reindeer 
was identical for each of the 5 antibodies and did not differ 
from the description of PrPSc distribution in North America 
cervids (16–18). The labeling was most consistent within 
the gray matter of the medulla oblongata, particularly in the 
dorsal motor of the vagus nerve (7). The thalamic and brain 
stem regions of the brain were most affected, with a minimal 
amount of PrPSc identified dorsal to the corpus callosum.
PrPSc labeling in the moose brains (Figure 1, panels 
F–J) was clearly different from that of the reindeer (Figure 
1, panels A–E). In the moose, after staining with F99/97.6 
and L42, PrPSc was almost exclusively observed as intra­
neuronal aggregates, although intraastrocytic type (multi­
ple small granules scattered in the cytoplasm of astrocyte-
resembling cells) and intramicroglial type (1 single or a 
few large granules in close proximity to microglia-like 
nuclei) were also observed in the cerebral cortices and ol­
factory bulb (online Technical Appendix Figure 1, panel 
A, 
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0702-
Techapp1.pdf). The degree of PrPSc staining was more 
intensive and appeared more widespread in the neuropil 
using SAF84.
At the level of the obex, we found stained neurons 
in all nuclei, whereas the dorsal motor of the vagus nerve 
was not remarkably stained, as observed in reindeer. The 
intensity of labeling varied among the 3 moose; no. 2 dis­
played sparse labeling, no. 3 widespread and abundant 
labeling, and no. 1 intermediate labeling intensity. We ob­
served PrPSc in all parts of the brain investigated except the

cerebella of moose nos. 1 and 2. A diffuse or discrete 
punctate staining was observed in the granular layer of 
the cerebellum of moose no. 3, with stronger staining in 
some Golgi neurons (online Technical Appendix Figure 
1, panel B). In all 3 moose, the cortical regions showed 
laminar staining of neurons in all the cell layers, especially 
in fusiform-shaped neurons. The neurons of the olfactory 
tubercle from all 3 also stained strongly, and some glia-
associated staining could be observed.
In contrast to the reindeer, the downstream flexible tail 
mAbs 12B2 and 9A2 did not stain in the moose (Figure 
1, panels F and G), suggesting that the moose PrPSc was 
truncated by endogenous proteases further upstream in the 
N terminus than was reindeer PrPSc. Contrary to previous 
findings in reindeer, PrPSc was not detected in the Ln from 
moose no. 1 or in the Ln and tonsils from moose no. 3 (lym­
phoid tissues were not available in moose no. 2) by either 
IHC or ELISA.
PrPSc from Norway Moose Compared with 
Other CWD Isolates from Canada and Norway
We compared the PrPSc features in  moose from Norway 
with those of other CWD isolates from Norway and Can­
ada by discriminatory WB, which enabled comparison 
of PrPres by epitope mapping with different antibodies. 
Norway moose PrPres had a lower apparent molecular 
weight (MW) than PrPres from Norway reindeer (Fig­
ure 2, panel A) or from Canada isolates (Figure 2, panel 
B). This lower MW was explained by the occurrence of 
more C-terminal cleavage of PrPSc by protease K, as con­
firmed by the partial loss of the 12B2 epitope (Figure 2, 
panel B).
Given the unusual pattern observed in moose isolates 
from Norway, we further investigated their biochemical 
characteristics with additional mAbs and by enzymatic 
deglycosylation (Figure 3). Moose samples showed a main 
C-terminal fragment of ≈17 kDa, detected with SAF84, 
L42, and 9A2, and an additional glycosylated C-terminal 
fragment of ≈13 kDa (CTF13) detected only with SAF84. 
The N terminal 12B2 epitope was mainly lost, although a 
small amount of PrPres was still detectable in moose no. 1 
(Figure 3) and no. 3 (online Technical Appendix Figure 2) 
with this antibody.

staining was primarily observed intraneuronally with L42, SAF84, and F99/97.6 (H–J) but was not observed using the more N-terminal 
mAbs 12B2 and 9A2 (F, G). Scale bars indicate 40 µm. mAbs, monoclonal antibodies.

In moose nos. 2 and 3, an additional glycosylated C-ter­
minal fragment of ≈16 kDa (CTF16) was detected by SAF84 
and L42 mAbs (Figure 3; online Technical Appendix Figure 
2). We cannot exclude that a small amount of CTF16 was 
also present in moose no. 1, given that a weak PrPres frag­
ment of ≈16 kDa was detectable upon deglycosylation and 
long exposure of blots (Figure 3; online Technical Appendix 
Figure 3). Moose nos. 1 and 3 also had a nonglycosylated in­
ternal fragment of ≈10 kDa, cleaved at both N and C termini 
of PrPSc, which was recognized by using mAbs 9A2 (Figure 
3). Moreover, the analysis of PrPres from different neuroana­
tomic regions showed that the slight differences observed 
among the 3 moose were not dependent on the area analyzed 
(online Technical Appendix Figure 2).
Comparison of the PrPSc Features of the Norway Moose 
with Sheep and Cattle Prion Strains from Europe
Comparison with ovine and bovine prions was performed to 
determine the N terminal cleavage of the main PrPres frag­
ment by analyzing the different PrPres fragments in each 
sample, the MW of these fragments, and the L42/12B2 an­
tibody ratio (Figure 4; online Technical Appendix Table). 
Among ovine prions, classical scrapie and atypical/Nor98 
were easily discriminated from moose isolates (Figure 5). 
Classical scrapie PrPres had a higher MW than moose PrPres,

as confirmed by the preservation of 12B2 epitope. As previ­
ously observed (19), Nor98 PrPres was cleaved at both the N 
and C termini, and the characteristic 11–12 kDa band was 
detected by L42, 9A2, and 12B2 mAbs (Figure 5). In contrast, 
CH1641 samples showed molecular features partially over­
lapping with the moose (Figure 5). CH1641 samples showed 
a PrPres of ≈17 kDa and were accompanied by an additional 
C-terminal fragment of 13–14 kDa detected by using SAF84 
mAbs (20). However, CTF16 and the internal PrPres fragment 
of 10 kDa could not be detected in CH1641 samples.
Moose PrPSc did not overlap with any type of bovine 
PrPSc. The lack of the 12B2 epitope in moose PrPres was 
similar to C-type and atypical L-type BSE, but the 2 bovine 
prions had neither CTF13, CTF16, nor the internal frag­
ment (Figure 6). H-type atypical BSE showed the CTF13 
and the internal fragment similar to moose PrPres, but the 
main PrPres fragment showed a higher MW and preserved 
the 12B2 epitope (Figure 6).
The ratio of reactivity obtained with L42 and 12B2 an­
tibodies reflected the N terminal cleavage of the main frag­
ment of PrPSc, enabling confirmation that the differences 
observed in MW of PrPres actually depend on different N 
terminal proteinase K cleavages, irrespective of the host 
species (Figure 4). Values >2 are indicative of BSE-like 
cleavage, whereas values <1 indicate a better preservation 
of 12B2 epitope compared with scrapie. In this respect, the 
behavior of moose PrPres was BSE-like (ratio >2). Howev­
er, moose no. 1 had a ratio lower than moose nos. 2 and 3. 
The CH1641-like field sample was similar to moose no. 1 
in this respect, whereas CH1641 was similar to moose nos. 
2 and 3. Finally, the value <1 observed for PrPres in H-type 
atypical BSE, CWD in reindeer, and CWD isolates from 
Canada reflected their higher MW compared with classical 
scrapie (online Technical Appendix Table).
Discussion
Although CWD has been detected in several captive and 
free-ranging cervid species from a large geographic area 
in North America, <10 cases in moose have been reported 
(21–23). We report 3 naturally occurring cases of prion dis­
ease in moose in Norway that showed molecular and IHC 
phenotypes differing from those previously described for 
classical CWD in North America, as well as in reindeer in 
Norway. The phenomenon of strain variation is well known 
in prion diseases and is often associated with phenotype 
variation in natural hosts, as observed in bovines with clas­
sical, H-type, or L-type BSE, and in sheep with classical or 
atypical/Nor98 scrapie. Identification of a new CWD phe­
notype in 3 moose in Norway can be suggestive of a new 
CWD strain. Although the existence of CWD strain varia­
tion in North America has been inferred from transmission 
studies (24–26), this phenomenon has not been directly as­
sociated with phenotypic variations in natural hosts so far.

analysis of PrPres (lane 4, CH1641; lane 5, moose no. 1; lane 6,

spongiform encephalopathy isolates (lane 1, atypical/Nor98; lane 2, 
classical scrapie; and lane 3, CH1641). A chronic wasting disease 
isolate from Canada was loaded as control (lane 7). The antibodies 
used are indicated on the left. Protein standards are shown in lane 
M (10, 15, 20, 25, 37, and 50 kDa). The small amount of PrPres with 
intact 12B2 epitope in moose no.1 had a molecular weight higher 
than that observed with more C-terminal monoclonal antibodies 
(18.7 +0.3 kDa measured with 12B2 vs. 17.2 +0.1 kDa measured 
with L42). Even if the increase of the apparent molecular weight 
might be a known behavior when proteinase K cleavage occurs 
near the epitope, we noted that, in the case of moose no. 1, the 
12B2-positive PrPres had a molecular weight higher than scrapie 
(18.1 +0.1 kDa measured with 12B2) and CH1641-like sample 
(18.1 +0.4 kDa when detected with 12B2). PrPres, protease-resistant

The phenotype variant found in moose from Norway 
could be hypothetically attributed to host species fac­
tors. To address this issue, we directly compared PrPSc 
characteristics in the Norway moose with those in a 
Canada moose with CWD. In agreement with the avail­
able evidence, we found that the Canada moose PrPSc had 
features different from Norway moose PrPSc and were in­
distinguishable from other cervids with classical CWD. 
This finding suggests that the variant PrPSc type observed 
in Norway moose could not simply reflect a host species 
factor. Notably, in both natural and experimental condi­
tions, CWD-affected moose in North America have been 
reported to display disease features indistinguishable 
from CWD in other cervids and had detectable PrPSc in 
lymphoid tissues (21,27).
Species-specific amino acid polymorphisms in the cer­
vid PrP are associated with CWD susceptibility, incubation 
time, and pathology (28–30). In transmission experiments, 
atypical features were reported in elk or wapiti and mule 
deer with genotypes associated with a relative resistance to 
disease, extension of the incubation period, or both (31,32). 
Moose PrP is polymorphic at codon 109 (K/Q) and 209 
(M/I), combined in 3 alleles: K109M209 (observed in Europe 
and North America), Q109M209 (observed in Europe), and 
K109I209 (observed in North America) (33,34). The 3  moose 
with CWD from Norway had the KK109MM209 genotype, 
whereas the moose case from Canada used for compari­
son had the KK109II209 genotype. Thus, we cannot exclude 
that the differences observed between Norway and Canada 
moose in our study are dependent on differences in PrP 
genotype. However, a classical CWD phenotype has been 
reported in naturally (21) and experimentally infected (27) 
moose with the KK109MM209 genotype, suggesting that a 
difference at PrP codon 209 is probably not the cause of the 
variant phenotype observed in  moose in Norway. All of 
these findings suggest that neither the species nor the indi­
vidual PrP genotypes are likely to have caused the variant 
phenotypes observed and imply that this variant phenotype 
could represent a novel CWD strain.
CWD is known to be a highly contagious disease in 
North America; however, data relating to the disease in 
moose are sparse and insufficient to understand the epi­
demiology and the implications of CWD in this species. 
The apparent low CWD prevalence reported for moose in 
North America compared with other cervid species might 
be attributable to the individual social behavior of moose 
and the minimal habitat overlap between moose and other 
cervids in areas with CWD. Additionally, surveillance pro­
gram design, disease variability, and host genetics might 
influence the prevalence of the disease. Based on the epi­
zootic dynamics in North America, CWD plausibly could 
have become established in reindeer in Norway more than 
a decade ago (35). In this scenario, the disease in moose 
could possibly be linked to the disease observed in reindeer, 
with strain mutation or phenotype shift putatively caused 
by interspecific transmission. However, a main cause of 
strain mutation after interspecies transmission (i.e., PrP 
amino acid differences between the donor and host species) 
is not relevant in this case because reindeer and moose

share the same PrP primary sequence. An alternative hy­
pothesis could be that moose have a prion disease that is 
independent of the reindeer epidemic, being either specific 
to the Norwegian moose or acquired by species other than 
the reindeer.
The 3 moose were 13, 14, and 13 years of age. Al­
though moose can reach ages beyond 20 years, we con­
sider these moose as old because female moose >10–12 
years of age start to show signs of senescence and de­
clining survival and reproduction rates (36,37). The old 
age of the moose, the absence of lymphoid tissue involve­
ment, and the low disease prevalence observed so far (3 of 
10,531 moose tested) could suggest that CWD in moose 
is less contagious than classical CWD or could represent 
a spontaneous TSE. The finding that the affected moose 
were from the same geographic area does not seem to 
support a spontaneous origin of the disease; however, the 
actual evidence for geographic clustering could have been 
biased by oversampling in Trøndelag County, where the 
first positive moose was detected. Lack of detailed data on 
the ages of the moose tested so far in different geographic 
areas prevents any definitive conclusion. Still, the recent 
detection of a positive moose in Finland, several hundred 
kilometers from Trøndelag County, might indicate that 
the disease is not restricted to Norway (38). The ongoing 
intensive surveillance in Norway and several European 
Union countries with large moose populations will help 
to better clarify the actual geographic distribution and 
prevalence and will be critical for understanding the con­
tagious or spontaneous nature of the disease.
The 3 moose analyzed shared a distinctive IHC pat­
tern, mainly characterized by intraneuronal accumulation 
of PrPSc, and common PrPSc features, such as the proteinase 
K N-terminal cleavage and the presence of an additional 
CTF13 fragment. However, we also observed unexpected 
differences among the 3 moose. By WB, the CTF16 frag­
ment was observed in moose nos. 2 and 3 but not in moose 
no. 1, whereas the nonglycosylated internal fragment of 
10 kDa was evident in moose nos. 1 and 3 but could not 
be detected in moose no. 2. Furthermore, we also showed 
that these differences did not depend on the brain area in­
vestigated. We cannot rule out that these slight differences 
might depend on technical issues rather than represent 
actual PrPSc variations. The outcome of the ongoing bio­
assay experiments will help to clarify the meaning of the 
observed variations.
By comparing the moose PrPSc features with other ani­
mal TSEs circulating in Europe, we found no evidence of 
similarities with bovine and ovine prions. Minimal simi­
larities were observed with CH1641 samples; however, 
CH1641 cases have not yet been detected in Norway. Bio­
assay in a large spectrum of rodent models will assist in 
determining whether these molecular similarities imply 
biologic association between the atypical CWD in moose 
and small ruminant CH1641. Transmission studies in sev­
eral rodent models are under way and will help to clarify 
whether the different phenotype observed (designated Nor­
16CWD) could reflect the presence of a new cervid prion 
strain in moose from Norway.

Among Shiga toxin (Stx)–producing Escherichia coli 
(STEC) O157:H7 strains, those producing Stx2a cause 
more severe diseases. Atypical STEC O157:H7 strains 
showing a β-glucuronidase–positive phenotype (GP STEC 
O157:H7) have rarely been isolated from humans, mostly 
from persons with asymptomatic or mild infections; Stx2a-
producing strains have not been reported. We isolated, from 
a patient with bloody diarrhea, a GP STEC O157:H7 strain 
(PV15-279) that produces Stx2a in addition to Stx1a and 
Stx2c. Genomic comparison with other STEC O157 strains 
revealed that PV15-279 recently emerged from the stx1a/
stx2c-positive GP STEC O157:H7 clone circulating in Ja­
pan. Major virulence genes are shared between typical 
(β-glucuronidase–negative) and GP STEC O157:H7 strains, 
and the Stx2-producing ability of PV15-279 is comparable 
to that of typical STEC O157:H7 strains; therefore, PV15-
279 presents a virulence potential similar to that of typical 
STEC O157:H7. This study reveals the importance of GP 
O157:H7 as a source of highly pathogenic STEC clones.
S
higa toxin (Stx)–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) 
with the serotype O157:H7 is characterized by the pos­
session of stx gene(s), the locus of enterocyte effacement 
(LEE) –encoded type 3 secretion system (T3SS), and a large 
virulence plasmid (pO157) that encodes enterohemolysin 
and other virulence factors, such as catalase-peroxidase 
KatP, a type II secretion system, and the protease EspP 
(1). Non–sorbitol-fermenting (NSF) and β-glucuronidase–
negative (GN) STEC O157:H7 (hereafter referred to as 
typical STEC O157:H7), the major clone among currently 
circulating STEC O157:H7 strains, frequently causes large 
outbreaks of severe enteric infections, including diarrhea, 
hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Stxs 
are classified as Stx1 or Stx2; Stx1 currently includes 3 sub­
types (stx1a, stx1c, and stx1d) and Stx2 includes 7 subtypes 
(stx2a to stx2g) (2). The stx genes are encoded by lambda-
like phages and have been acquired by STEC strains through 
phage transduction (3). Typical STEC O157:H7 produces 
Stx1a, Stx2a, and Stx2c, either alone or in combination. 
Stx2a-producing strains cause more severe infections than 
do Stx1a-producing strains (4). In addition, the levels of 
Stx2 production among the STEC O157:H7 strains carrying 
stx2c, but not stx2a, are typically very low (5–7).
According to the stepwise evolution model (8,9), 
STEC O157:H7 evolved from ancestral enteropathogen­
ic E. coli (EPEC) O55:H7 (sorbitol-fermenting [SF] and 
β-glucuronidase–positive [GP]; clonal complex [CC] A1) 
through sequential acquisitions of virulence factors and phe­
notypic traits along with a serotype change (Figure 1). Two 
phenotypic variants of STEC O157 are known: SF/GP STEC 
O157:H– (nonmotile) (CC A4), known as the German clone 
(SF STEC O157:H–), and NSF/GP STEC O157:H7 (CC A5) 
(GP STEC O157:H7). Both variants are postulated to have 
emerged from a hypothetical intermediate, CC A3; typical 
STEC O157:H7 (CC A6) has further emerged from CC A5.
SF STEC O157:H– strains are usually stx2a positive 
(10); like typical STEC O157:H7, they have caused many 
outbreaks and sporadic cases of hemolytic uremic syn­
drome in Germany and other countries in Europe. There­
fore, this clone is generally thought to be highly pathogenic 
(11–13). In contrast, although GP STEC O157:H7 strains 
have been reported to carry both stx1 and stx2 or only stx2 
(14–16), strains producing the Stx2a subtype have not been 
described. Although GP STEC O157:H7 was first isolat­
ed from a patient with bloody diarrhea in 1994 (14), this 
variant has rarely been isolated from humans. Moreover, 
human isolates obtained to date have generally been isolat­
ed from patients with asymptomatic or mild infections (16).

The genomic information available for GP STEC O157:H7 
is also limited to strain G5101 (9,17) and 4 strains in pub­
lic databases. Thus, the virulence potential of GP STEC 
O157:H7 remains to be fully elucidated.
In this study, we isolated a GP STEC O157:H7 strain 
that produces Stx2a, in addition to Stx1a and Stx2c, from 
a patient with bloody diarrhea in Japan and determined its 
complete genome sequence. To reveal the genomic fea­
tures of the Stx2a-producing strain, we determined the draft 
genome sequences of an additional 13 GP STEC O157:H7 
isolates, which are all Stx2a negative but Stx1a/Stx2c (or 
Stx2c) positive, and performed fine phylogenetic and ge­
nomic comparisons of these GP STEC O157:H7 strains 
with typical STEC O157:H7 and SF STEC O157:H– 
strains. We also analyzed the Stx production levels of GP 
STEC O157:H7 strains.
Methods
Bacterial Strains
The strains used in this study are listed in online Tech­
nical Appendix Table 1 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/12/18-0404-Techapp1.pdf). The GP STEC 
O157:H7 strain PV15-279 was isolated from an adult pa­
tient in Japan who was hospitalized in 2015 with severe 
symptoms, including bloody diarrhea. The other 13 GP 
STEC O157:H7 strains sequenced in this study were isolat­
ed in Japan during 1988–2013 from humans with or with­
out symptoms. We obtained genome sequence information 
for 3 E. coli O55:H7 (18–20), 2 SF STEC O157:H–, 14 
typical STEC O157:H7 (21–26), and 2 GP STEC O157:H7 
strains (17) from public databases.
Subtyping of stx Genes
We performed in silico subtyping of stx1 and stx2 
in all strains analyzed in this study. We used blastn 
(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast; >99% identity and 
>99% coverage) for comparisons with previously report­
ed reference sequences (2).

We determined the complete genome sequence of PV15-
279 using PacBio reads obtained with an RS II system 
(PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA). We assembled the reads 
with Canu version 1.5 (27) and circularized them using 
Circlator (28). We obtained Illumina paired-end reads 
(300 bp × 2) with a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Di­
ego, CA, USA) and mapped them to the assembly using 
the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (29) for sequence-error cor­
rection with Pilon (30). We completed further corrections 
to the sequences corresponding to Stx phage regions using 
MiSeq reads obtained by sequencing long-range PCR prod­
ucts covering each Stx phage. We performed annotations 
with the DDBJ Fast Annotation and Submission Tool (31), 
followed by manual curation using the IMC-GE software 
(In Silico Biology, Kanagawa, Japan).
We obtained the draft genome sequences of 13 GP 
STEC O157:H7 strains by assembling Illumina paired-end 
reads using Platanus (32). The Illumina reads for strain 
LB473017, for which the only read data available were 
from public databases, were also assembled with Platanus.
The genome sequences of PV15-279 and the 13 GP 
STEC O157:H7 strains have been deposited in DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank under the Bioproject accession numbers 
PRJDB6584 and PRJDB6498, respectively. The accession 
numbers of each sample, including the reference data, are 
listed in online Technical Appendix Table 1.

(33). The genome sequences to be examined were aligned 
with the phage- and insertion sequence (IS)–masked chro­
mosome sequence of the STEC O157:H7 strain Sakai (22) 
using MUMmer (34) to identify conserved regions (cutoff 
thresholds >98% sequence identity and >1,000-bp align­
ment length) in each strain and the SNP sites located there­
in. We then determined the core genome sequence that was 
conserved in all strains examined. Only SNPs located in 
the core genome were subjected to further analysis. After 
reconstructing the genome sequences of each strain using 
the SNPs and removing recombinogenic SNP sites using 
Gubbins (35), we constructed a maximum-likelihood phy­
logenetic tree using RAxML (36) with the general time-
reversible plus gamma model of nucleotide substitution 
and 500 bootstrap replicates. The tree was displayed and 
annotated using iTOL (37).
Repertoire Analysis of Genes Encoding T3SS Effectors 
and Plasmid-Encoded Virulence Factors
We analyzed the conservation of genes encoding T3SS ef­
fectors and plasmid-encoded virulence factors with blastn 
(>90% identity and >30% coverage). All intact effector 
genes and plasmid virulence genes identified in strains 
Sakai and PV15-279 were clustered using CD-HIT (38) at 
>90% identity and >30% alignment coverage of the lon­
ger sequences, and representative sequences of each cluster 
were used to create a database for blastn analysis.
Stx Phage Sequencing
We determined the complete sequences of the Stx1a and 
Stx2c phages from strain 980938 (from an asymptomatic 
carrier) and the Stx2c phage from strain 981447 (from a 
patient with bloody diarrhea) as described previously (39). 
We constructed fosmid libraries of the 2 strains using a 
CopyControl fosmid library production kit (Epicenter Bio­
technologies, Madison, WI, USA). We screened the stx1- 
or stx2-containing clones using PCR and sequenced them 
by the shotgun sequencing strategy using an ABI3730 se­
quencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Stx Production Assay
We inoculated bacterial cells into 40 mL of CAYE broth 
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and grew them to mid-log 
phase at 37°C with shaking. We then added mitomycin C 
(MMC) to the culture at a final concentration of 500 ng/
mL. After MMC addition, we collected 100 µL of the cul­
ture every hour and immediately subjected it to sonication 
using a Bioruptor (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). We obtained 
the soluble fractions of each cell lysate via centrifugation 
at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. We determined Stx1 and 
Stx2 concentrations in each cell lysate using a previously 
described sandwich ELISA (40). We captured Stx using 
RIDASCREEN Verotoxin microtiter plates (R-Biopharm, 
Darmstadt, Germany) coated with capture antibodies that 
recognize both Stx1 and Stx2. We conjugated monoclo­
nal antibodies against Stx1 and Stx2 (LSBio, Seattle, WA, 
USA) with horseradish peroxidase using the Peroxidase 
Labeling Kit–NH2 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and em­
ployed them as detection antibodies. We used reagents sup­
plied in the RIDASCREEN Verotoxin kit for detection. Fi­
nally, we measured the absorbance at 450 nm (A450) using 
Tecan Infinite 200 PRO (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).
Results
Isolation and Genome Sequencing of 
GP O157:H7 Strains
In PV15-279, we detected stx2a in addition to stx1a and 
stx2c (online Technical Appendix Table 1). Determination 
of the complete genome sequence of PV15-279 revealed 
that the genome consisted of a 5,598,151-bp chromosome 
and a 94,391-bp plasmid. The draft genome sequences of 13 
additional GP STEC O157:H7 strains were also determined 
for comparison (online Technical Appendix Table 1). These 
strains were all stx1a/stx2c-positive and stx2a-negative. The 
uidA gene, which encodes β-glucuronidase, was intact in all 
the GP STEC O157:H7 strains sequenced in this study, as 
well as in 2 GP STEC O157:H7 strains whose draft genome 
sequences were publicly available (online Technical Appen­
dix Table 1). In typical STEC O157:H7, uidA has been inac­
tivated by a frameshift mutation (41).
Comparisons of General Genomic Features and 
Mobile Genetic Elements
Although the chromosome of PV15-279 was ≈100 kb 
larger than that of the typical GP STEC O157:H7 strain 
Sakai (Table and online Technical Appendix Figure 1), the 
chromosome backbone was highly conserved; 97.2% of

the coding sequences (CDSs) identified in Sakai were con­
served in PV15-279. Among the various types of mobile 
genetic elements (MGEs), integrative elements (defined as 
elements that contain an integrase gene but no other MGE-
related genes) were well conserved and showed only minor 
variations. Among the 5 integrative elements identified in 
Sakai, 1 small element (SpLE2) was missing in PV15-279, 
and multiple small structural variations were observed in 
3 elements (online Technical Appendix Table 2, Figure 
2, panel B). In contrast, the prophage contents exhibited 
notable differences. PV15-279 contained 22 prophages, 
whereas Sakai contained 18 prophages. This difference is 
attributable mainly to the difference in chromosome sizes 
between the 2 strains. Although most of the integration 
sites used by Sakai prophages (13/16) are also used by 
PV15-279 prophages (online Technical Appendix Table 2, 
Figure 2, panel A), in most instances prophages that had 
integrated into the same site showed notable variations be­
tween the 2 strains, suggesting the existence of different 
evolutionary histories. Furthermore, PV15-279 carried as 
many as 4 Stx phages: 1 Stx1a phage, 2 Stx2a phages, and 1 
Stx2c phage (online Technical Appendix Figure 1). In con­
trast, Sakai carries 1 Stx1a phage and 1 Stx2a phage (see 
subsequent sections for a comparison of these phages with 
Stx phages from various STEC O157:H7 strains). Surpris­
ingly, 1 of the 2 Stx2a phages (PV15p10) was integrated 
together with 3 prophages at the ydfJ locus in PV15-279 
in tandem (online Technical Appendix Table 2, Figure 1, 
Figure 2, panel A).
The repertoires and total copy numbers of IS elements 
also exhibited notable differences (online Technical Ap­
pendix Table 3). Although 24 types of IS elements were 
identified in Sakai and 18 types were identified in PV15-
279, only 14 were shared by the 2 strains. A greater number 
of total copies of IS elements was detected in PV15-279 
(91, compared with 73 in Sakai), primarily because of the 
proliferation of IS1203 (also annotated as IS629) in PV15-
279. The virulence plasmid pO157 also showed notable 
differences, as described in the next section.
Phylogenetic Characterization of GP 
STEC O157:H7 Strains
To determine the precise phylogenetic position of PV15-279 
in STEC O157, we performed high-resolution phylogenetic 
analysis using the genome sequences of various typical and 
atypical STEC O157 strains (Figure 2). The results clearly 
indicate that PV15-279 formed a distinct cluster with all oth­
er GP STEC O157:H7 strains, including 2 US isolates, and is 
a strain that recently emerged from the stx1a/stx2c-positive 
clone circulating in Japan. The phylogenetic relationship of 
this cluster with other STEC O157 lineages was concordant 
with the stepwise evolution model (Figure 1).
In our phylogenetic tree, the GP STEC O157:H7 
strains were relatively clonal compared with the typical 
Figure 2. Whole-genome sequence-based phylogenetic analysis and repertoires of T3SS effectors and plasmid-encoding virulence factors 
from the study of Stx-producing E. coli O157:H7. The genome sequences of all the strains used in this study were aligned with the complete 
chromosome sequence of Sakai, and the single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the 4,074,209-bp backbone sequence that were 
conserved in all the test strains were identified. After removing the recombinogenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms sites, we performed a 
concatenated alignment of 5,803 informative sites to generate the maximum-likelihood phylogeny. The conservation of T3SS effectors and 
plasmid-encoding virulence factors is shown in the tree. Colored boxes indicate the presence, and open boxes the absence, of each gene. GP,

STEC O157:H7 strains, although these typical STEC 
O157:H7 strains were selected to represent their cur­
rently known phylogenetic diversity (26) (Figure 2). De­
spite the close phylogenetic relationship between the GP 
STEC O157:H7 strains, only PV15-279 was stx2a-pos­
itive, indicating that PV15-279 acquired stx2a very re­
cently. No stx genes were detected in the publicly avail­
able sequence data for the GP STEC O157:H7 strain 
G5101, although this strain was previously reported to 
contain stx1 and stx2 (14).
Distribution of T3SS Effectors in the 
GP O157:H7 Lineage
In addition to 5 LEE-encoded T3SS effectors, 18 fami­
lies of effectors are encoded at non-LEE genomic loci 
(non-LEE effectors) in Sakai (42). In PV15-279, we 
identified most of the effector families found in Sakai 
(online Technical Appendix Table 4). The major dif­
ferences were the absence of nleF in PV15-279 and the 
presence of ospB and ospG in PV15-279, both of which 
are absent in Sakai. After subgrouping the 4 effector 
families (espM, espN, espO, and nleG) into 2–5 sub­
groups based on their sequence diversity, we analyzed 
the effector repertoires of the STEC O157 isolates used 
in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2). This analysis 
revealed that the effectors identified in PV15-279 were 
mostly conserved in other GP STEC O157:H7 strains, 
although some variations were detected.
Virulence Plasmid pO157 of GP O157:H7 Lineage 
The pO157 plasmid of PV15-279 was nearly identical to 
the plasmid from the GP STEC O157:H7 strain G5101 
(43), with several small variations that were apparently 
generated by mechanisms involving IS (online Techni­
cal Appendix Figure 3). The plasmid-encoded virulence 
genes identified in PV15-279 were well conserved in oth­
er GP STEC O157:H7 strains, except for 3 strains from 
which pO157 has apparently been deleted (Figure 2). It 
is unknown whether this deletion occurred before or after 
strain isolation.
As previously reported (43), the pO157 plasmids from 
GP STEC O157:H7 showed high similarity to those from 
typical STEC O157:H7 and SF STEC O157:H–. Thus, a 
pO157-like plasmid was likely acquired by the common 
ancestor of the 3 STEC O157 lineages. A notable difference 
between the pO157 plasmids of the 3 STEC O157 lineages 
was the distribution of katP and espP. These genes were 
detected only in typical STEC O157:H7 strains, suggesting 
that these genes may have been specifically acquired by the 
typical STEC O157:H7 lineage. Although the roles of katP 
and espP in STEC virulence in humans have not yet been 
elucidated, at least the SF STEC O157:H– strain causes se­
vere infections even without these genes.
Stx Phages of GP STEC O157:H7 
As shown in Figure 3, we performed fine genomic com­
parisons of the Stx phages from PV15-279 with the Stx1a, 
Stx2a, and Stx2c phages from other STEC O157:H7 strains 
used in the phylogenetic analysis shown in Figure 2 (phag­
es were included only when complete sequences were 
available). The Stx1a and Stx2c phages of the GP STEC 
O157:H7 strain 980938 and the Stx2c phage of the GP 
STEC O157:H7 strain 981447 were sequenced individu­
ally and included in the analysis.
Stx1a phages were integrated in sbcB in the 2 GP STEC 
O157:H7 strains but were integrated in yehV or argW in 
typical STEC O157:H7 strains. According to the dot plot 
analysis, the 2 Stx1a phages from GP STEC O157:H7 
were nearly identical (Figure 3). The phages from typical 
STEC O157:H7 strains were classified into 3 groups based 
on sequence similarity. The Stx1a phages from GP STEC 
O157:H7 showed various levels of sequence similarity to 
each group. The highest similarity was observed for the 3 
phages integrated in yehV, but a clear difference was ob­
served in the early region.
The 2 Stx2a phages from PV15-279 that integrated in 
yecE and ydfJ were nearly identical (only 2 SNPs), indicat­
ing that these phages were recently duplicated in this strain. 
With 1 exception (the phage from strain 155), the Stx2a 
phages from the typical STEC O157:H7 strains analyzed in 
this study were integrated in either wrbA or argW, and all 
shared a similar genomic structure, although considerable 
variations were observed in the early region, as reported 
previously (7). The Stx2a phages from PV15-279 exhibited 
a genetic structure similar to that of strain 155, which was 
also integrated in yecE. However, those phages showed 
high sequence similarity only in limited regions.
The Stx2c phages from GP STEC O157:H7 strains 
(all integrated in yehV) were nearly identical, showing only 
minor variations, such as IS integration. The Stx2c phages 
from typical STEC O157:H7 strains, which were all inte­
grated in sbcB, also exhibited very similar genomic struc­
tures and sequences. Although notable sequence similarity 
was observed between the Stx2c phages from GP STEC 
O157:H7 and typical STEC O157:H7, the early regions 
were very different.
Stx Production by GP STEC O157:H7 Strains
Stx1 production is partially dependent on phage induction, 
whereas Stx2 production is strongly dependent on phage 
induction (44–46). We compared Stx production levels 
between GP STEC O157:H7 and typical STEC O157:H7 
using MMC as a phage induction agent; we analyzed 
Stx1 and Stx2 production by representative strains of the 
2 lineages (PV15-279, 981447, and 980938 for GP STEC 
O157:H7; Sakai and EDL933 for typical STEC O157:H7).

induction in each strain, and clear cell lysis (a clear reduc­
tion in OD600 values) was observed only in EDL933 and 
PV15-279 (Figure 4, panel A).
Consistent with a previous report (47), the Stx1 con­
centration was not notably elevated by phage induction in 
any of the strains, and no clear difference was observed be­
tween the GP STEC O157:H7 and typical STEC O157:H7 
strains (Figure 4, panel B). In contrast, levels of Stx2 pro­
duction were highly variable, as previously shown for typi­
cal STEC O157:H7 strains (7). Although Stx2 production 
was poorly induced in 2 GP STEC O157:H7 strains carry­
ing stx2c alone, it was strongly induced in the stx2a-positive 
PV15-279 and typical STEC O157:H7 strains (Figure 4, 
panel C). Therefore, stx2a was strongly induced in PV15-
279, as in typical STEC O157:H7, but stx2c was poorly 
induced in PV15-279, as in the other GP STEC O157:H7 
strains. The level of Stx2 production by PV15-279 was 
comparable to that of typical STEC O157:H7 strains and 
similar to that of the Sakai strain.
Discussion
In this study, we isolated a GP STEC O157:H7 strain 
(PV15-279) that produces Stx2a in addition to Stx1a and 
Stx2c. The whole-genome sequence-based phylogenetic 
analysis, which included additional GP STEC O157:H7 
strains and representative strains belonging to other E. 
coli O55/O157 lineages, revealed that PV15-279 recently 
emerged by the acquisition of Stx2a phage from the stx1a/
stx2c-positive GP STEC O157:H7 clone circulating in Ja­
pan (Figure 2). Most of the major virulence genes identified 
in typical STEC O157:H7, such as T3SS effector genes and 
plasmid-encoded virulence genes, were well conserved in 
PV15-279 and other GP STEC O157:H7 strains, although 
some variations were detected (Figure 2). Moreover, the 
ability of PV15-279 to produce Stx2a was comparable to 
that of typical STEC O157:H7 (Figure 4). These findings 
suggest that PV15-279 presents a virulence potential simi­
lar to that of typical STEC O157:H7. In fact, PV15-279 
was isolated from a patient who had severe enteric symp­
toms, including bloody diarrhea. However, further investi­
gations are necessary to determine how the variations in the 
virulence gene repertoire detected in the comparison with 
other STEC O157 lineages affect the potential virulence of 
GP STEC O157:H7. The repertoires of the minor virulence 
genes of GP STEC O157:H7 must also be investigated.
We also obtained several noteworthy findings con­
cerning the evolution of GP O157:H7 in this study. For 
example, fine genomic comparisons of Stx phages revealed 
that Stx phages differ notably between GP STEC O157:H7 
and typical STEC O157:H7 (Figure 3). Although many 
of these variations may have been generated through ex­
tensive recombination with various resident or incoming 
phages (48), the acquisition of the Stx2a phage by the GP 
STEC O157:H7 strain PV15-279 was apparently an inde­
pendent genetic event. The clear differences in the genetic 
structure, sequence, and integration sites of Stx2c phages 
between GP and typical STEC O157:H7 may suggest that 
Stx2c phages were also acquired independently by the 2 
lineages after they separated. In contrast, the similar genet­
ic structures and sequences of the pO157 plasmids from GP 
and typical STEC O157:H7 and SF STEC O157:H– sug­
gest that a pO157-like plasmid might have been acquired 
by their common ancestor. Although more extensive stud­
ies are needed to obtain a complete understanding of these

the addition of MMC, the OD600 of each strain was measured every hour for 8 hours, and 100 µL of the culture was collected at each 
time point. Cell lysates were prepared, and the Stx1 and Stx2 concentrations in the soluble fractions were analyzed using a sandwich 
ELISA. All experiments were performed 3 times, and the averages and SEs of the Stx1 and Stx2 concentrations in each sample 
are plotted. Strains Sakai and EDL933 belong to typical STEC O157:H7, and the other 3 strains belong to GP STEC O157:H7. GP,

issues, only a limited number of SF STEC O157:H– ge­
nome sequences and no complete sequences of the Stx 
phages of this lineage are currently available. The avail­
able genome sequence information of GP STEC O157:H7 
is also highly biased toward Japanese isolates.
In conclusion, we isolated a Stx2a-producing GP 
STEC O157:H7 strain that emerged from the stx1a/stx2c-
positive GP STEC O157:H7 clone circulating in Japan; the 
virulence potential of this isolate is similar to that of typi­
cal STEC O157:H7. Researchers should pay more atten­
tion to this less commonly reported STEC O157 lineage, 
particularly the spread of this Stx2a-producing GP STEC 
O157:H7 clone and the emergence of additional stx2a-
positive clones. Larger-scale genomic analyses including 
more GP STEC O157:H7 strains from various geographic 
regions and more SF STEC O157:H– strains are required to 
obtain a better understanding of the evolution and genomic 
diversity of GP O157:H7.

β-Glucuronidase–Positive E. coli Producing Stx2a 
To clarify the role of bats in the ecology of Ebola viruses, 
we assessed the prevalence of Ebola virus antibodies in 
a large-scale sample of bats collected during 2015–2017 
from countries in Africa that have had previous Ebola out­
breaks (Guinea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo) or 
are at high risk for outbreaks (Cameroon). We analyzed 
4,022 blood samples of bats from >12 frugivorous and 
27 insectivorous species; 2–37 (0.05%–0.92%) bats were 
seropositive for Zaire and 0–30 (0%–0.75%) bats for Sudan 
Ebola viruses. We observed Ebola virus antibodies in 1 in­
sectivorous bat genus and 6 frugivorous bat species. Cer­
tain bat species widespread across Africa had serologic evi­
dence of Zaire and Sudan Ebola viruses. No viral RNA was 
detected in the subset of samples tested (n = 665). Ongoing 
surveillance of bats and other potential animal reservoirs 
are required to predict and prepare for future outbreaks.
S
ince the first outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in 
1976 in the northern part of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (DRC), 26 recognized outbreaks have occurred 
in humans across Africa; fatality rates of outbreaks have 
been 25%–90% (1–4). Each EVD outbreak most likely re­
sulted from independent zoonotic events.
Bats are believed to play a role in the ecology of Eb­
ola viruses as a reservoir species (5). Bats might infect 
humans directly or via intermediate amplifying hosts, like 
nonhuman primates or duikers (6,7). Bats might serve as a 
source of infection in certain areas where bats are hunted 
and eaten as bushmeat, but infection could also occur af­
ter consumption of fruits contaminated with saliva, urine, 
or feces from Ebola virus–infected bats (8,9). Ebola virus 
emergence through exposure to bats was suspected for at 
least 2 outbreaks: Luebo (the DRC) in 2007 and West Af­
rica in 2013 (10,11).
Relatively few data are available to support the role 
of bats in the ecology of Ebola viruses. During the EVD

RESEARCH
Ebola Virus in Frugivorous and Insectivorous Bats
virus RNA and antibodies were detected in live-caught 
specimens from 3 fruit bat species (Epomops franqueti, 
Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata); virus 
sequences were found in the livers or spleens of a few bats 
(6). In subsequent studies in Gabon, the Congo, Ghana, and 
Zambia, antibodies were detected in additional frugivorous 
bat species (Eidolon helvum, Epomophorus gambianus, 
Rousettus aegyptiacus, Micropteropus pusillus) and 1 in­
sectivorous species (Mops condylurus) (12–16). The am­
plification and sequencing of viral RNA of other filoviruses 
in bats, such as Marburg virus in bats from Africa (17–20), 
Lloviu virus in bats from Europe (21), and new filoviruses 
in bats from China (22), has provided additional evidence 
for a possible role of bats in Ebola virus ecology.
In general, EVD outbreaks have been limited in terms 
of their geographic spread and chains of human-to-human 
transmission (1). However, during the 2013–2016 out­
break, virus spread to the urban areas of 3 countries, infect­
ing ≈30,000 persons in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, 
and ≈11,000 deaths were recorded (23). This outbreak il­
lustrated the potential for epidemic spread from a single 
zoonotic transmission, with severe public health and so­
cioeconomic impact (24). Additional studies are urgently 
needed to identify the animal reservoir, predict EVD out­
break risks, and improve our capacity to control epidemics.
In previous modeling studies, areas were defined as at 
risk for EVD outbreaks on the basis of data collected from 
a limited number of wildlife bat species from a few geo­
graphic regions (5,25). Also, a wide variety of serologic 
assays and interpretation criteria have been used, making 
comparison of results challenging (12–16,26,27). For this 
study, we performed a large serosurvey with a highly spe­
cific and sensitive high-throughput assay to assess Ebola 
virus prevalence in bats from Africa (28). We studied bats 
from Guinea and the DRC, countries with previous EVD 
outbreaks, and Cameroon, a country considered at high risk 
for future EVD outbreaks (5,25).
Materials and Methods
Study Sites and Sample Collection
During November 2015–August 2017, we collected sam­
ples from free-ranging frugivorous and insectivorous bats 
in Guinea, Cameroon, and the DRC. We captured bats at 
night using ground mist nets or harp traps in roosting and 
foraging sites. We set up ground mist nets (12 × 3.2 m) 
of 30-mm and 60-mm mesh sizes at different heights (1–7 
m) to maximize capture of different species. We opened 
nets or harp traps just before sunset and checked for bats 
every 1–2 hours. Captured bats were released the same 
night immediately after sampling. Using bat whole blood 
taken by venipuncture of the propatagial or brachial vein, 
we dropped blood samples directly onto Whatman 903 
filter paper (GE Healthcare, Feasterville-Trevose, PA, 
USA). We air-dried and preserved samples individually in 
plastic bags containing silica desiccant and stored them in 
hermetic boxes; 2–3 weeks later, we transferred dried blood 
spots to -20°C until needed for analysis. Data recorded in 
the field included information on capture site (global posi­
tioning system coordinates, ecologic environment), capture 
method, morphology (body measurements, weight, color), 
sex, age class (adult, juvenile), and species (identified visu­
ally). We collected negative control samples (n = 145) from 
a captive-born insectivorous bat species (103 Carollia per­
spicillata bats) hosted at the Parc Zoologique de Montpel­
lier (Montpellier, France) and 2 frugivorous bat species (19 
Pteropus giganteus bats, 23 R. aegyptiacus bats) hosted at 
Wilhelma Zoo and Botanical Garden (Stuttgart, Germany). 
We collected and preserved samples the same way we did 
for free-ranging bats.
Screening for Ebola Virus Antibodies
We tested dried blood spots with a Luminex-based sero­
logic assay adapted for bats (28) (online Technical Appen­
dix, 
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0740-
Techapp1.pdf). The assay included recombinant Ebola 
virus proteins glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, or viral protein 
40 for different lineages: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and 
Reston. We reconstituted plasma from dried blood spots as 
previously described (28) and incubated 100 μL of sample 
(final plasma dilution 1:2,000) with 50 µL of recombinant 
protein–coated beads (2 µg protein/1.25 × 106 beads) in 
96-well flat-bottom filter plates (Millipore, Tullagreen, 
Ireland) on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 16 h at 4°C in 
the dark. After washing, we added 0.1 μg/mL of goat anti-
bat biotin–labeled IgG (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, 
France) per well and incubated for 30 min at 300 rpm. Af­
ter another round of washing, we added 50 µL of 4 µg/mL 
streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, 
France) per well and incubated for 10 min at 300 rpm. Re­
actions were read with BioPlex-200 (BioRad, Marnes-la-
Coquette, France). We expressed results as median fluo­
rescence intensity (MFI) per 100 beads. We included 3 
samples on every plate to validate interassay repeatability.
Determination of Cutoffs
In the absence of positive control samples, we used 4 dif­
ferent statistical methods to determine the MFI cutoff value 
for each antigen (29,30) (online Technical Appendix Table 
1). First, we used a general formula that involved the MFI 
of the 145 negative control samples, and we assigned the 
cutoff as mean plus 4 times the SD (mean + 4×SD). Second, 
we used a change point analysis (31) to identify the value 
at which statistical properties of the underlying probability 
distribution changed. This value was used to identify outli­
ers and classify them as reactive. We used the R package

changepoint (32) to calculate a single shift in the arithmetic 
mean with the at-most-1-change method (33). Third, we 
fitted univariate distributions to our data and defined the 
cutoff as a 0.001 risk for error, as was used in other virus 
serology studies (13,34). We reduced the set of candidate 
distributions following a bootstrapped skewness-kurtosis 
analysis (35). We performed fitting by maximum-likeli­
hood estimation and selected the best-fit distribution on the 
basis of the Akaike information criteria with the R library 
fitdistrplus (36). A negative binomial distribution best-fit 
the data; however, we also used the negative exponential 
distribution as in Pourrut et al. and Laing et al. (13,34). For 
every antigen, we computed bootstrap values using 10,000 
replicates and averaged. We performed analyses with R 
version 3.3.2 software (https://www.r-project.org/). We 
considered a blood sample reactive if the MFI of the reac­
tion was above the cutoff. We defined Ebola virus antibody 
positivity as reactivity to glycoprotein and nucleoprotein of 
the same lineage, as was done in our previous study (28).
Nucleic Acid Extraction and PCR Screening for 
Ebola Virus RNA
We extracted total DNA and RNA from dried blood spots as 
previously described using Nuclisens (bioMerieux, Marcy-
l’Etoile, France) or m2000sp methods (Abbott Molecular 
Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA), which are known for a high per­
formance recovering nucleic acids from dried blood spots 
(37,38). For bat species from Cameroon and Guinea, we 
screened for Zaire Ebola virus RNA by seminested reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the nucleoprotein 
region of the virus genome. We amplified a 126-bp frag­
ment of Zaire Ebola virus using primers NP1F1 (forward, 
5′-CGGACACACAAAAAGAAWGAA-3′) and NP1R-ZR 
(reverse, 
5′-CTCTATCTTKGTGATRTGGCTCTGA-3′) 
in the first round of PCR and NP1F2 (forward, 5′- TTGT­
GTGCGARTAACTAYGAGGAAG-3′) plus NP1R-ZR 
in the second round. For species from the DRC, we per­
formed seminested RT-PCR targeting the viral protein 35 
region of the genome using the protocol of He et al. with 
modifications (41). In the first round, we amplified a 217-
bp fragment with primers VP35-F (5′-ATYATGTATGAT­
CACYTVCCWGG-3′) and VP35-R (52-AGCGRATGTG­
GATSACRGGT-32) and, in the second round, a 184-bp 
product with primers VP35-R and VP35-in-F (5′-GCTT­
TYCAYCAAYTAGTRCAAG-3′).
Molecular Confirmation of Bat Species
We confirmed bat species identification recorded in the field 
on a subset of samples by using molecular tests. We am­
plified an ≈800-bp fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome 
b using primers cytb-L14724 (forward) and cytb-H15506 
(reverse) (11,39,40). We substituted the cytb-L14724 
primer 
with 
cytb-L140217 
(5′-ATGACCAACATCC­
GAAAATCNCAC-3′) to improve PCR performance for 
certain species. We purified PCR products through agarose 
gel (1%) and directly sequenced on an ABI 3500 sequencer 
(Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). We performed 
BLAST analyses (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to 
identify the most similar bat species. For samples with no or 
low similarity (<97%) hits with species in GenBank, we per­
formed phylogenetic analyses with newly obtained sequenc­
es and reference sequences for different bat species using 
maximum-likelihood methods implemented with PhyML 
(http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/) to determine genus.
Results
Bat Species and Sampling
We analyzed blood samples from 4,022 wild bats from 21 
different regions in Cameroon (n = 10), Guinea (n = 8), and 
the DRC (n = 3) (Figure 1; Table 1). To increase species 
diversity, we captured bats in multiple ecologic settings: for­
ests (49%), open fields (10%), villages (29%), plantations 
(7%), and urban areas (5%). For 1,470 (36.5%) samples, 
species identification in the field was confirmed by sequence 
analysis. At each site, >1 sample was confirmed per sampling 
date, capture method, and morphologic description. For the 
remaining samples, species identification was extrapolated 
by combining molecular and morphologic data, including 
photographs whenever available. For some insectivorous bat

Ebola Virus in Frugivorous and Insectivorous Bats
families (Miniopteridae, Molossidae, Nycteridae, Rhinolo­
phidae), identification was possible only at the genus level; 
for some Molossidae bats, we could not distinguish between 
Mops and Chaerephon genera because of the lack of se­
quences in GenBank (Table 2). For 87 (2.16%) samples, spe­
cies identification was not possible because incomplete data 
were recorded in the field, and available biologic materials 
were insufficient for molecular confirmation. We collected 
samples from 1,736 (43.2%) frugivorous bats (family Ptero­
podidae) of 12 species and 2,199 (54.7%) insectivorous bats 
(7 families) of >27 species. The insectivorous bat families 
sampled, in order of decreasing frequency, were Hipposid­
eridae (31.9%), Molossidae (13.4%), Miniopteridae (5.8%), 
Rhinolophidae (2.1%), Vespertilionidae (0.8%), Nycteridae 
(0.5%), and Emballonuridae (0.12%). Overall, 54.7% of 
bats were female and 43.8% were male; for 1.5% (n = 60) of 
bats, sex was unknown. Most (77.9%) bats were adults, and 
9.6% were juveniles; for 12.5% (n = 502) of bats, age could 
not be determined or was not recorded.
Bats Antibodies against Different Ebola Virus Antigens
We tested all samples for Ebola virus antibodies. The num­
ber of samples reacting with >1 antigen was 734 (18.2%) 
by the mean + 4×SD method, 274 (6.8%) for the change-
point method, 175 (4.4%) for the binomial method, and 457 
(11.4%) for the exponential method. Blood samples fre­
quently reacted with glycoprotein antigens; samples reacted 
most with Zaire and Sudan Ebola virus antigens and least 
with Reston (Table 3). Simultaneous reactivity to >1 anti­
gen (i.e., glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, viral protein 40) from 
the same virus lineage was rare. Simultaneous reactivity to 
the same antigen from different virus lineages was frequent; 
32.3%–76.7% of blood samples were reactive to glycopro­
tein from >2 Ebola virus species, 18.4%–34.0% to viral pro­
tein 40, and 1.5%–4.4% to nucleoprotein (online Technical 
Appendix Table 2). When using the criterion simultaneous 
presence of antibodies to nucleoprotein and glycoprotein, the 
antibody positivity for Zaire or Sudan Ebola virus antibodies 
was generally <1% for all bats tested, regardless of cutoff 
method, and was lower among insectivorous than frugivo­
rous bats: 0.05%–0.27% (insectivorous) and 0.06%–1.79% 
(frugivorous) for Zaire Ebola virus versus 0%–0.09% (in­
sectivorous) and 0%–1.61% (frugivorous) for Sudan Ebola 
virus (Table 3; Figure 2). Three samples were positive for 
Zaire and Sudan Ebola viruses, but only by less stringent cut­
off methods (i.e., mean + 4×SD).

Zaire and Sudan Ebola Virus Reactivity of Different 
Bat Species
We estimated specific reactivity to Zaire and Sudan Ebo­
la viruses by bat species. We did not include Bundibugyo 
and Reston because recombinant nucleoproteins were 
not available. Among insectivorous bats, only blood 
samples from Mops sp. bats (1–6/494) were positive for 
Zaire or Sudan Ebola virus antibodies (Table 4). Among 
frugivorous bats, samples from E. helvum, H. monstro­
sus, and R. aegyptiacus bats had the highest reactivity. 
We observed Zaire and Sudan Ebola virus seropositivity 
in these 3 species with almost all cutoff methods: 0.2%–
3.3% for Zaire Ebola virus and 1.0%–2.9% for Sudan 
Ebola virus in E. helvum bat samples, 0.5%–1.6% for 
Zaire Ebola virus and 1.1%–4.3% for Sudan Ebola virus 
in H. monstrosus bat samples, and 0.6%–2.5% for Zaire 
Ebola virus and 0.8%–1.4% for Sudan Ebola virus in R. 
aegyptiacus bat samples. We observed 2.4% Zaire Ebola 
virus–seropositive samples for Lissonycteris angolensis 
bats and 0.5% for Epomophorus sp. bats, but only by less 
stringent cutoff methods. One sample from M. pusillus 
bats was seropositive for Sudan Ebola virus. No samples 
from E. franqueti or M. torquata bats were reactive with 
any Ebola virus antigens. Samples from the 1 Scotonyc­
teris zenkeri bat and 20 Megaloglossus woermanni bats 
were seronegative. Overall, Zaire or Sudan Ebola virus 
antibodies were observed in 7 (1 insectivorous and 6 fru­
givorous) bat species.

Ebola Virus in Frugivorous and Insectivorous Bats
Comparison of Zaire Ebola Virus Seroprevalence in 
Bats from Africa across Studies
For comparison, we compiled data regarding Zaire Ebola 
virus serology in bats of known species from previous stud­
ies (n = 4,493) and this study (n = 3,935; 46.7%) (Tables 5, 
6). Data were available for 3,023 insectivorous bats of ≈30 
species from 7 different families; 2,199 (72.7%) were from 
this study (Table 5). Insectivorous bat samples originated 
from Guinea, Cameroon, the DRC, and Gabon. Zaire Ebola 
virus reactivity has been observed only in M. condylurus 
bat samples from Gabon and Mops sp. bat samples from 
Cameroon. Data were available for 5,405 frugivorous bats 
of 17 species from 12 genera from West (Guinea, Ghana), 
West Central (Cameroon, Gabon, the Congo, the DRC), 
and East (Zambia) Africa (Table 6). No Zaire Ebola virus 
reactivity has been seen in blood samples from bat species 
Casinycteris, Megaloglossus, Nanonycteris, and Scotonyc­
teris, but only a limited number of samples (n = 152) have 
been tested. Overall, blood samples from 8 frugivorous bat 
species have been found reactive with Zaire Ebola virus an­
tigens. Blood samples from E. helvum, H. monstrosus, and 
R. aegyptiacus bats from several countries across Africa 
have been reported to be seropositive. Reactivity has been 
observed with samples from E. gambianus bats in Ghana 
(10.8%) and Guinea. Reactivity was observed with large 
sample sets from E. franqueti bats derived from Gabon 
and the Congo and a small sample set from Ghana but not 
Guinea, Cameroon, or the DRC. M. pusillus and M. torqua­
ta bats tested positive for Zaire Ebola virus antibodies in 
studies in which large sample sets were collected. Among 
L. angolensis bat samples, only those from Cameroon have 
tested positive for antibodies.

RESEARCH
RT-PCR Screening for Zaire Ebola Virus RNA
We screened 665 samples from the DRC (n = 193), 
Cameroon (n = 399), and Guinea (n = 73) by RT-PCR 
for the presence of Zaire Ebola virus RNA. Of the 294 
samples originating from bats previously documented 
to carry Zaire Ebola virus RNA (6) (i.e., H. monstrosus 
[132 from Cameroon, 1 from the DRC], M. torquata [20 
from Cameroon, 25 from the DRC], and E. franqueti [116 
from Cameroon]), all were negative for Zaire Ebola virus 
RNA. Of the 371 samples from bat species E. helvum (58 
from Cameroon, 165 from the DRC, 3 from Guinea), L. 
angolensis (8 from Cameroon, 4 from Guinea), M. pu­
sillus (2 from the DRC, 1 from Guinea), R. aegyptiacus 
(45 from Cameroon, 40 from Guinea), E. gambianus (25 
from Guinea), and Mops sp. (20 from Cameroon), all were 
negative for Zaire Ebola virus RNA.
Discussion
To clarify the role of bats in Ebola virus ecology and iden­
tify where the virus circulates between outbreaks, we tested 
>4,000 bats, almost doubling the total number of samples 
tested in all previous studies in Africa (5–7,42). We provided 
data on bats from Cameroon, added to the existing data on 
bats from Guinea and the DRC, and substantially increased 
the data available on insectivorous bats. We tested samples 
with the same assay, enabling comparison across species and 
countries. We used different statistical methods to determine 
positive sample numbers and expressed the proportion of 
reactive samples as a range on the basis of the different cut­
off values proposed by those methods. As has been done in 
studies of human Zaire Ebola virus survivors (28,43), we de­
fined Zaire and Sudan Ebola virus positivity as the presence 
of antibodies to both nucleoprotein and glycoprotein. As 
such, we estimated that 2–37 (0.05%–0.92%) bats were se­
ropositive for Zaire Ebola virus and 0–30 (0%–0.75%) bats 
were seropositive for Sudan Ebola virus (Table 3). Among 
insectivorous bats, we observed Zaire and Sudan Ebola vi­
rus antibodies only in Mops sp. bats, an observation that has 
previously been observed (13). We provided information 
on insectivorous Miniopterus and Rhinolophus bats and ex­
tended knowledge on Mops and Hipposideros bats; all 1,200 
Hipposideros samples were seronegative. We confirmed the 
presence of Zaire Ebola virus antibodies in only 1 of 3 fru­
givorous species in which Zaire Ebola virus RNA has been 
reported, that is, in H. monstrosus but not E. franqueti or 
M. torquata bats (6). However, this result might have been 
influenced by sample size, test used, and interpretation crite­
ria. We confirmed antibodies in E. helvum bats and showed 
that Zaire Ebola virus antibodies are widespread among this 
species across Africa: Ghana and Zambia, and with our data, 
also Cameroon, Guinea, and the DRC (13,14,16). We con­
firmed antibodies in R. aegyptiacus bats from Cameroon and 
Guinea, in agreement with previous findings in these bats 
from the Congo and Gabon (13). For E. gambianus bats 
from Ghana, we also observed Zaire Ebola virus reactivity 
of samples from this species in Guinea (15). In contrast with 
a previous study, we observed Sudan Ebola virus antibodies 
(not Zaire Ebola virus antibodies) in M. pusillus bats (13). 
We also identified Zaire Ebola virus antibodies in L. ango­
lensis bats from Cameroon, although only when using less 
stringent cutoff calculations.
When combining data from previous Zaire Ebola vi­
rus seroprevalence studies in bats with data from our study, 
only 1 insectivorous bat species (Mops sp.) and 8 frugivo­
rous bat species (E. helvum, E. gambianus, E. franqueti, H. 
monstrosus, L. angolensis, M. pusillus, M. torquata, R. ae­
gyptiacus) exhibited Zaire Ebola virus antibodies (13–16). 
As seen in bat samples from Zambia, we observed in this 
study Sudan Ebola virus antibodies in E. helvum bats from 
Guinea, Cameroon, and the DRC, suggesting that Zaire and 
Sudan Ebola viruses co-circulate and could be widespread 
among this species. However, only 1 other study has tested

Ebola Virus in Frugivorous and Insectivorous Bats
for Ebola viruses other than Zaire Ebola virus in E. helvum 
bats (16). In our study, we also observed Sudan Ebola virus 
antibodies in Mops sp., H. monstrosus, and R. aegyptiacus 
bats in Cameroon. Almost all samples were positive for ei­
ther Zaire or Sudan Ebola virus but not for both.
Despite the presence of Ebola virus antibodies, the 
role of bats as reservoir species remains unclear because 
viral RNA detection is rare. In only 1 study Zaire Ebola vi­
rus RNA was amplified in a few bats (6). Thus, antibodies 
might reflect previous acute infection with viral clear­
ance. Unlike inoculations with Marburg virus (44–46), 
experimental inoculation of R. aegyptiacus bats with 
Zaire Ebola virus leads to antibody development but in­
frequent or absent detection of viral RNA or shedding 
(44,47). R. aegyptiacus bats are therefore able to clear 
Zaire Ebola virus after a short infectious period with­
out viral shedding and with little or no transmission. No 
antibodies or viral RNA were detected in noninoculated

RESEARCH
bats housed with experimentally Zaire Ebola virus–
infected bats (44). Whether this low level of infectiousness 
also occurs for other bat species that carry Ebola virus an­
tibodies remains to be determined. Zaire Ebola virus was 
experimentally inoculated in other bat species (M. condylu­
rus, Chaerephon pumilus, and Epomophorus wahlbergi) 
in only 1 study; virus replication was seen in all species, 
and fecal shedding was seen in E. wahlbergi bats (48). R. 
aegyptiacus bats experimentally infected with Marburg 
virus were shown to develop antibodies that protect against 
reinfection (49). Long-term survival with Zaire Ebola vi­
rus antibodies has been reported with E. helvum bats from 
Ghana but without information on protection (14). Among 
insectivorous bats, the presence of Ebola virus antibodies 
in only Mops sp. is striking, suggesting higher exposure or 
susceptibility compared with other insectivorous bats.
In conclusion, we demonstrated higher rates of Eb­
ola virus antibodies in frugivorous than in insectivorous

RESEARCH
bats. The total number of frugivorous species shown to 
be Zaire Ebola virus seropositive has increased to 8, and 
1 insectivorous bat species (Mops sp.) was confirmed to 
be seropositive. Zaire and Sudan Ebola viruses circulate 
in different species across Africa, with potential co-cir­
culation of both viruses in some species. Although we 
have data on >8,000 bats from >40 species, this sample 
size is small, given the high numbers of bats that con­
stitute colonies. This study illustrates the complexity of 
tracking the animal reservoir of Ebola viruses, not only 
because sampling of wild bats without performing eu­
thanasia is difficult and time-consuming but also because 
of the absence of a reference standard for serologic tests. 
To clarify the significance of Ebola virus antibodies, 
documenting the extent to which viral RNA and shed­
ding can be detected in species with antibodies is crucial 
for predicting and controlling the risk for new outbreaks. 
Efforts must continue not only to sample bats but also 
other animals to elucidate where the virus circulates 
in wildlife.

All hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants reported to infect hu­
mans belong to the species Orthohepevirus A (HEV-A). 
The zoonotic potential of the species Orthohepevirus C 
(HEV-C), which circulates in rats and is highly divergent 
from HEV-A, is unknown. We report a liver transplant recipi­
ent with hepatitis caused by HEV-C infection. We detected 
HEV-C RNA in multiple clinical samples and HEV-C antigen 
in the liver. The complete genome of the HEV-C isolate had 
93.7% nt similarity to an HEV-C strain from Vietnam. The 
patient had preexisting HEV antibodies, which were not pro­
tective against HEV-C infection. Ribavirin was an effective 
treatment, resulting in resolution of hepatitis and clearance 
of HEV-C viremia. Testing for this zoonotic virus should be 
performed for immunocompromised and immunocompetent 
patients with unexplained hepatitis because routine hepati­
tis E diagnostic tests may miss HEV-C infection. HEV-C is 
also a potential threat to the blood product supply.
H
epatitis E virus (HEV) infects 20 million humans world­
wide annually (1). HEV-infected persons usually have 
self-limiting acute hepatitis. However, persistent hepatitis 
can occur in HEV-infected immunocompromised patients 
who acquire infection by eating undercooked pork, rabbit, 
deer, camel, or boar meat (2–6). HEV transmission through 
blood product transfusion also has been described (7).
The diverse Hepeviridae family, which incorporates 
all HEV variants, includes members whose primary host 
species are terrestrial mammals (genus Orthohepevirus) 
and fish (genus Piscihepevirus) (8). The Orthohepevirus 
genus is classified into 4 species; HEV variants that have 
been reported to infect humans belong to Orthohepevirus 
A (HEV-A). Five genotypes within HEV-A (HEV-1–4 and 
-7) cause hepatitis in humans, and 3 genotypes (HEV-3, -4, 
and -7) can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised 
patients after foodborne zoonotic transmission (2,6,9,10).
In addition to HEV-A, the Orthohepevirus genus in­
cludes 3 other species: Orthohepevirus B circulates in chick­
ens, Orthohepevirus C (HEV-C) in rats and ferrets, and Or­
thohepevirus D in bats. HEV-C, also known as rat hepatitis 
E virus, shares only 50%–60% nt identity with HEV-A (8). 
The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is unknown; cases of clini­
cal infection have not been reported. The substantial phylo­
genetic divergence between HEV-A and HEV-C, especially 
in critical receptor binding domains, forms a theoretical spe­
cies barrier (11). Serologic and molecular tests for HEV are 
designed primarily to detect HEV-A, and they might miss 
HEV-C infections. Therefore, the threat to human health, 
including blood and organ supply safety, from HEV-C is 
unknown. We aimed to prove definitively that HEV-C can 
infect humans and describe the clinical, epidemiologic, ge­
nomic, and serologic features of this new zoonosis.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
We conducted this study in Queen Mary Hospital, a 1,700-
bed tertiary care hospital in Hong Kong. We assessed 518 
solid-organ transplant recipients (kidney, liver, lung, and 
heart transplant) who were followed up in Queen Mary 
Hospital for persistent biochemical hepatitis from January 
1, 2014, or date of transplant (whichever date was later) 
through December 31, 2017. We defined persistent hepatitis 
as elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >1.5 times 
the upper limit of the reference level for a continuous period 
of >6 weeks. For patients whose ALT met this definition, 
we reviewed clinical records, ultrasonogram results, endo­
scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography results, and 
laboratory results to identify the likely cause of hepatitis. We

considered patients to have hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepati­
tis C virus (HCV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation if 
any of these viruses were detected in blood during the hepati­
tis episode. In patients with no identifiable cause of hepatitis, 
HEV IgM ELISA screening was performed, in accordance 
with the usual practice in Queen Mary Hospital. HEV in­
fection was diagnosed if the HEV IgM assay was positive, 
and persistent HEV infection was diagnosed if HEV vire­
mia in patient plasma lasted for >3 months. PCR sequencing 
was performed for speciation of HEV isolate. We obtained 
ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board of the 
University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority West Cluster. 
We obtained written informed consent from all patients with 
persistent HEV infection.
Nucleic Acid Detection for Hepatitis Viruses and 
HEV Complete Genome Sequencing
We designed 3 in-house–developed reverse transcription 
PCRs (RT-PCRs) to detect HEV (online Technical Appen­
dix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-
0937-Techapp1.pdf). Hepatitis A virus (HAV) RNA and 
CMV DNA detections were performed using in-house 
nucleic acid amplification tests. HBV and HCV viral loads 
were quantified using commercial kits (COBAS TaqMan, 
Roche, Basel, Switzerland; and RealTime HCV, Abbott, 
Chicago, IL, USA, respectively).
We sequenced the PCR product of the pan-Ortho­
hepevirus RT-PCR using the RT-PCR primers. Because 
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of pa­
tient HEV isolates clustered with rat HEV-C strains, 
primers for complete genome amplification were de­
signed by multiple alignment of rat HEV-C genomes in 
GenBank (online Technical Appendix Table 2). We used 
these primers for complete genome sequencing of HEV in 
patient feces (strain LCK-3110). We constructed phylo­
genetic trees using MEGA6 with the general time revers­
ible plus gamma model (12).
Cloning and Purification of Recombinant HEV-A 
and HEV-C Open Reading Frame 2 Protein
We used specific primers (online Technical Appendix) 
to amplify the genes encoding the 239 aa immunogenic 
recombinant peptides of HEV-A (genotype 4) and HEV-
C. Cloning the amplified genes into a bacterial expression 
vector, expression in Escherichia coli, and protein puri­
fication were performed as previously described (13,14).
Antibodies Against HEV-A and HEV-C
Polyclonal antibodies against the HEV-C recombinant pro­
tein were raised in mice (online Technical Appendix). In 
addition, we used 2 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
against open reading frame (ORF) 2 antigen of HEV-A in 
this study.
Serologic Testing
We conducted HEV antibody screening for patients 
with unexplained persistent hepatitis using HEV IgM 
and HEV IgG commercial ELISA kits (Wantai, Beijing, 
China) and detected hepatitis B surface antigen (HB­
sAg) using the ARCHITECT HBsAg chemiluminescent 
microparticle immunoassay (Abbott). HAV IgM and 
HCV antibodies were tested using VIDAS immunoas­
say kits (bioMérieux, Marcy-L’Étoile, France). For in­
vestigation of the HEV-C transmission event, we sub­
jected patient and donor serum to HEV-A and HEV-C 
Western blots using polyclonal antiserum from mice 
inoculated with HEV-C protein and mAbs as controls. 
ELISAs using recombinant HEV-A and HEV-C protein-
coated plates were designed based on the method de­
scribed by Shimizu et al. with modifications (15). We 
set cutoffs and interpreted results to differentiate HEV-
A– and HEV-C–specific serologic responses (online 
Technical Appendix).
Virus Culture
We selected cell lines A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), Huh-7 
(hepatocellular carcinoma), and Caco-2 (colorectal adeno­
carcinoma) to investigate whether human cell lines could 
support HEV-C growth. Cell lines were chosen if they sup­
ported growth of patient-derived HEV isolates or HEV in­
fectious clones (16–18) (online Technical Appendix). We 
subjected supernatants and lysates to HEV-C quantitative 
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunostaining.
Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescence Staining
We conducted immunohistochemical staining of for­
malin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue sections and 
infected A549 cell culture monolayers using HEV-C 
polyclonal serum antibodies and HEV-A mAbs. We per­
formed immunofluorescence staining of permeabilized 
infected cells using HEV-C polyclonal antiserum (online 
Technical Appendix).
Epidemiologic and Environmental Investigation
We retrieved organ and blood donor serum for HEV 
ELISA, Western blot, and HEV-C qRT-PCR. To survey 
density of rat fecal contamination and collect environ­
mental specimens for HEV-C qRT-PCR, we visited the 
patient’s housing estate on November 22, 2017. Further­
more, from deep freezers we retrieved archived Rattus sp. 
liver, spleen, rectal swab, and kidney specimens collected 
during 2012–2017 within a 2.5-km radius around the pa­
tient’s residence for preexisting pathogen surveillance 
programs and subjected them to HEV-C qRT-PCR. The 
HEV-C ORF2 fragment of qRT-PCR–positive specimens 
was sequenced using additional primers (online Technical 
Appendix Table 3).

Rat HEV after Liver Transplant
Results
Hepatitis E Incidence in Transplant Recipient Cohort
Of 518 patients, 52 (10.2%) had persistent hepatitis (Table 
1). Five (9.6%) patients with hepatitis tested positive for 
HEV IgM; 4 of these were kidney transplant recipients, 
and 1 was a liver transplant recipient. Together with re­
activation of chronic HBV infection, HEV was the third 
most common cause of viral hepatitis in the local transplant 
population. Of the 5 patients, plasma HEV-A qRT-PCR 
of 3 renal transplant recipients was positive; another re­
nal transplant recipient tested negative for HEV RNA. We 
have previously reported the clinical details of the 3 HEV-
A–infected patients (9). Rat-derived HEV-C infection was 
diagnosed in the liver transplant recipient, which accounted 
for 1.9% (1/52) of persistent hepatitis in our cohort.
Patient History
A 56-year-old man underwent deceased-donor liver trans­
plant on May 14, 2017, because of hepatocellular carcino­
ma complicating chronic HBV carriage. He received 1,000 
mg hydrocortisone and 20 mg basiliximab (anti–interleu­
kin-2 receptor mAb) as intraoperative antirejection pro­
phylaxis and 4 units of platelets (derived from 4 separate 
blood donors) during the operation. His liver function tests 
(LFTs) reverted to normal, and he was discharged on post­
transplant day 11. He was taking mycophenolate mofetil 
(500 mg 2×/d), tacrolimus (1 mg 2×/d), and prednisolone 
(5 mg 2×/d) as antirejection prophylaxis. He was also tak­
ing entecavir (0.5 mg 1×/d) for HBV suppression; serum 
HBsAg was negative 6 weeks after the transplant.
Routine phlebotomy on July 12 (day 59 posttransplant) 
revealed mild derangement of ALT to 74 U/L (reference 
8–58 U/L). Other LFTs were normal. One week later, there 
was further derangement of parenchymal liver enzymes: 
ALT was 138 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was elevat­
ed to 65 U/L (reference 15–38 U/L), γ-glutamyltransferase 
was 124 U/L (reference 11–62 U/L), and alkaline phos­
phatase was within reference limits at 70 U/L (reference 
42–110 U/L). Complete blood count showed lymphopenia, 
at 0.88 × 109 cells/L, although total leukocyte count was 
within reference levels.
The patient was empirically managed for acute graft 
rejection with increased immunosuppression using a 3-day 
course of methylprednisolone. Valganciclovir was pre­
scribed for low-level whole blood CMV viremia of 5.31 
× 102 IU/mL. However, LFTs continued to deteriorate de­
spite clearance of CMV viremia and increased immunosup­
pression. Liver biopsy showed nonspecific mild to moder­
ate inflammatory infiltrate comprising small lymphocytes 
in the portal tracts. There were no viral inclusion bodies, 
and immunohistochemical staining for CMV and hepatitis 
B core antigens was negative. Results of testing for HBsAg 
in serum, HBV DNA in plasma, HCV antibody in serum, 
HAV IgM in serum, and HAV RNA in plasma and feces 
were all negative. HEV IgM was detected in serum col­
lected on August 22 (day 100 posttransplant). Because of 
the serology result and ongoing LFT derangement, persis­
tent HEV infection was suspected. A qRT-PCR targeting 
HEV-A was performed on patient fecal and plasma speci­
mens; HEV-A RNA was not detected in either specimen. 
An RT-PCR capable of detecting all species within the 
Orthohepevirus genus detected amplicons (online Techni­
cal Appendix Figure 1) in plasma, feces, and liver tissue. 
Sequencing confirmed that the products clustered with rat 
HEV-C strains.
Viral RNA Kinetics and Effect of Ribavirin Therapy
The patient’s archived serum, saliva, urine, feces, and 
nonfixed liver tissue samples were retrieved for HEV-
C RNA load testing using HEV-C qRT-PCR (Figure 1, 
panel A). Two pretransplant serum samples and 1 serum 
sample collected on day 17 after transplant did not contain 
HEV-C RNA. The first specimen with detectable HEV-C 
RNA was a serum sample collected 43 days after trans­
plant, which contained an RNA load of 9.48 × 102 cop­
ies/mL; this result preceded onset of LFT derangement 
by 3 weeks. After heightened immunosuppression in July

and August, the HEV-C RNA load in blood steadily rose 
along with ALT (Figure 1, panel B). Variation in ALT 
correlated with the HEV-C RNA viral load by linear re­
gression (R2 = 0.791). HEV-C RNA was also detected in 
feces, saliva, and liver tissue (Figure 1, panel A); feces 
contained the highest RNA load.
Immunosuppressant dosages were decreased after con­
firmation of HEV infection. However, ALT and HEV-C 
RNA loads continued to increase despite reduction of plas­
ma tacrolimus levels by 55% and rebound of lymphocyte 
count to 2.27 × 109 cells/L. Therefore, oral ribavirin 400 
mg twice daily was started on September 7. ALT decreased 
within the first week after start of therapy and normalized 
within 1 month after starting ribavirin (Figure 1, panel B). 
HEV-C RNA loads also decreased to undetectable levels 
in plasma obtained on February 13, 2018. Ribavirin was 
stopped in April 2018, and HEV-C RNA in serum remained 
undetectable as of August 21, 2018, confirming sustained 
virologic response.
Serologic Analysis
We retrospectively tested all available patient serum and 
plasma samples for HEV IgG and IgM ELISA using the 
Wantai ELISA kit. The patient’s serum before transplant 
was HEV IgG positive and IgM negative. HEV IgG and 
IgM optical density rose sharply from June 27, when HEV-
C RNA was first detectable in blood, to July 25, when clini­
cal hepatitis began (online Technical Appendix Figure 2). 
Despite high IgG levels, HEV-C RNA continued to rise 
until ribavirin was started.
To characterize the serologic response, Western blot 
using purified HEV-A and HEV-C recombinant proteins 
(Figure 2, panel A) was performed. Two mAbs raised 
against HEV-A were used: 1 produced a band in HEV-A 
IgG blot but not in the HEV-C blot (lane 8; Figure 2, pan­
els B, C) confirming specificity, and the other was cross-
reactive against HEV-A and HEV-C (lane 9; Figure 2, pan­
els B, C). Polyclonal serum raised in mice inoculated with 
HEV-C protein reacted in both blots, showing that the se­
rum was cross-reactive (lane 7). Patient serum collected on 
day 100 after transplant (lane 1) was tested against HEV-
A and HEV-C recombinant proteins. The serum specimen 
showed reactivity in both Western blots.
Two patient serum samples, 1 obtained 3 months be­
fore transplant and the other obtained on day 100 after 
transplant, were tested in IgG ELISAs using HEV-A and 
HEV-C protein-coated plates. The pretransplant serum 
(Figure 2, panel D) had cross-reactive antibodies against 
both HEV-A and HEV-C proteins (<2-fold difference in 
titer using OD cutoff of 0.3). However, the posttransplant 
serum (Figure 2, panel E) showed >16-fold rise in HEV-
A IgG titer and markedly higher reactivity against HEV-
A than against HEV-C (>4-fold difference in titer using a 
cutoff OD of 0.3).
Liver Histologic and Immunohistochemical Analyses
Serial liver biopsies showed progressively worsening he­
patocyte ballooning and degenerative changes (Figure 3, 
panels A, B). Apoptotic hepatocytes were identified in the 
biopsy obtained on day 98 posttransplant (Figure 3, panel B). 
Immunohistochemical staining with the cross-reactive mAb 
showed positive perinuclear cytoplasmic signals (Figure 3, 
panel C), and negative control with bovine serum albumin 
instead of mAb showed no signals (Figure 3, panel D).
Genomic Description
Complete genome sequencing of the patient’s fecal HEV 
isolate (LCK-3110) showed that the genome was 6,942 bp

long (GenBank accession no. MG813927). Phylogenetic 
trees of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ORF1, 
ORF2, and ORF3 of HEV strains showed that LCK-3110 
is most closely related to the Vietnam-105 strain (Figure 
4; online Technical Appendix Figure 3, panels A, B), 
sharing 93.7% nt identity. Because no phylogenetic in­
congruence was found on comparison of trees of the 3 
genomic segments, recombination was unlikely (Table 2; 
online Technical Appendix). To determine whether com­
monly used RT-PCRs for HEV nucleic acid amplifica­
tion could detect HEV-C, we aligned published primer/
probe sequences of HEV RT-PCRs (19–22) with com­
plete genome sequences of HEV-A (genotype 1 reference 
strain) and HEV-C (strains LCK-3110, Vietnam-105, and 
LA-B350) using ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.clustal.org/
clustal2/). Alignment revealed significant lack of homol­
ogy with HEV-C at the 3′ end of either the forward or 
reverse primer for the assays described by Jothikumar et 
al. and Rolfe et al. (online Technical Appendix Figure 4, 
panels A, B) (20,21). Our in-house HEV-A qRT-PCR is 
based on the primer/probe design of Jothikumar et al. and 
was unable to detect HEV-C in patient specimens (20). 
For the assays described by Mansuy et al. and Colson et 
al. (19,22), there was significant lack of matching of probe 
sequence (40%–45% mismatch) to HEV-C genomes (on­
line Technical Appendix Figure 4, panels C, D), which 
most likely would result in failure to detect any amplified 
nucleic acid.

RESEARCH
Virus Culture
We detected HEV-C RNA in supernatants from all 3 cell 
lines (Figure 5, panel A) inoculated with patient’s feces at 
steady levels from day 3 to day 7 after inoculation. RNA 
loads in cell lysates were ≈1 log higher than concomitantly 
harvested supernatants, suggesting successful viral cell en­
try. Immunohistochemical staining (Figure 5, panels B, C) 
of A549 cell monolayers and immunofluorescence stain­
ing of infected Huh-7 and Caco-2 cells (online Technical 
Appendix Figure 5) confirmed the presence of cytoplasmic 
HEV ORF2 antigen when stained with antiserum against 
HEV-C. These findings suggested abortive viral replication 
of HEV-C in human cell lines.
Epidemiologic Investigation
The first clinical sample with detectable HEV-C RNA was 
obtained 43 days after transplant. HEV-C was not detected 
in serum samples obtained before transplant. Serum samples 
from the organ donor and all 4 platelet donors tested negative 
by IgM Western blot against HEV-C recombinant protein 
(Figure 2, panel C, lanes 2–6) and HEV-C qRT-PCR.
The patient’s house unit was located adjacent to a refuse 
chute. He had noticed rodent droppings but had never seen 
rats inside his home. A site visit to the housing estate was con­
ducted on November 22, 2017. Rodent droppings were found 
around refuse collection bins on the ground floor and the floor 
where the patient lived. Twelve rodent fecal specimens, 2 swab 
samples from the drain, and 2 swab samples from the refuse 
room floor tested negative for HEV-C RNA. To expand the 
investigation, we retrieved archived rodent samples collected 
from the area around the patient’s housing estate (≈2.5-km ra­
dius) as part of preexisting pathogen surveillance programs. 
Spleen, kidney, liver, and rectal swab specimens from 27 rats 
were tested by qRT-PCR. The internal organs of 1 street rat 
(Rattus norvegicus) collected in 2012 tested positive for HEV-
C RNA (strain name SRN-02). The ORF2 aa sequence of this 
isolate had 90.9% identity to LCK-3110.
Discussion
Discovered in Germany in 2010, rat HEV variants have 
been detected in rodent samples in Asia, Europe, and North 
America (23–26). Because of high divergence from human-
pathogenic HEV, rat HEV has been classified into a sepa­
rate species, Orthohepevirus C, within the family Hepeviri­
dae (27). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is controversial. 
Virus-like protein ELISAs show possible subclinical infec­
tion among forestry workers in Germany and febrile inpa­
tients in Vietnam, although interpretation of such studies 
is difficult because of serologic cross-reactivity between 
HEV-A and HEV-C (15,28). Immunocompetent rhesus 
macaques do not appear to be susceptible to experimental 
infection with a North America HEV-C isolate (23).
In this study, we detected HEV-C RNA in multiple 
specimens from a transplant recipient. The HEV-C infec­
tion manifested as persistent hepatitis, as shown by tempo­
ral correlation between blood HEV-C RNA detection and

and normalization of liver function tests with viral clear­
ance. These findings prove that HEV-C can infect humans 
to cause clinically significant illness and signal a need to 
reevaluate the importance of HEV-C as a human zoonosis 
among both immunocompromised and immunocompetent 
patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology.

RESEARCH
ORF2 protein did not protect them from HEV-A infection 
and low amino acid homology between HEV-A and HEV-
C in critical immunogenic domains (29), our data suggest 
that HEV-A antibodies do not protect against HEV-C in­
fection. The patient’s postinfection serum showed signifi­
cantly higher reactivity in an HEV-A–specific ELISA than 
in an HEV-C ELISA; the humoral immune responses of 
persons with past HEV-A infection to de novo HEV-C in­
fection are worthy of further study to identify whether an­
amnestic responses are mounted.
The patient’s HEV isolate had high nucleotide similar­
ity to the HEV-C Vietnam-105 strain. It shared less homol­
ogy with the North America LA-B350 strain, especially in 
the ORF3 domain, which is important for viral egress (30). 
Interspecies transmission could not be attributed to specific 
viral mutations. Future studies will need to include differ­
ences in zoonotic potential between HEV-C strains from 
Asia and the Americas.
The patient’s immunosuppression possibly enabled 
the virus to surmount the species barrier, as described 
previously for avian influenza (31,32). HEV-C infections 
may go undiagnosed because of amplification failure in 
RT-PCRs, which are designed based on HEV-A sequenc­
es (online Technical Appendix Figure 3). The Wantai 
ELISA, based on HEV-A genotype 1, was able to detect 
IgM in this patient, but whether the assay is sensitive for 
HEV-C infection or was detecting only HEV-A–specific 
antibodies is uncertain. Therefore, we believe that spe­
cific RT-PCR is the most reliable method to diagnose 
HEV-C infections.
Our findings are also relevant to blood and organ dona­
tion safety. Because of the inability of commonly used RT-
PCRs to detect HEV-C, transmission from asymptomati­
cally infected immunocompetent donors may occur, even 
in countries that screen donated blood for HEV. Studies 
examining frequency of HEV-C contamination in blood 
products are needed to quantify this threat.
The patient lived in a housing estate with evidence 
of rat infestation in the refuse bins outside his home. We 
identified HEV-C in street rodents from the area, but the 
isolate was not closely related to the patient’s isolate. The 
route of transmission is unclear; we postulate that con­
tamination of food by infected rat droppings in the food 
supply is possible. Other possibilities include reactivation 
of a subclinical infection in the patient posttransplant or a 
donor-derived infection from residual HEV-C in the trans­
planted organ. However, we found no serologic or viro­
logic evidence of HEV-C infection in donor and recipient 
serum before transplant. An occult infection in the donated 
liver, which reactivated after transplant as described pre­
viously for HEV-A, cannot be completely excluded. De­
tailed studies are needed to ascertain the route of HEV-C 
infection in humans.

We assessed how community education efforts influenced 
pregnant women’s Zika prevention behaviors during the 
2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–Puerto 
Rico Department of Health Zika virus response. Efforts in­
cluded Zika virus training, distribution of Zika prevention kits, 
a mass media campaign, and free home mosquito spraying. 
We used telephone interview data from pregnant women 
participating in Puerto Rico’s Women, Infants, and Children 
Program to test associations between program participa­
tion and Zika prevention behaviors. Behavior percentages 
ranged from 4% (wearing long-sleeved shirt) to 90% (re­
moving standing water). Appropriate mosquito repellent use 
(28%) and condom use (44%) were common. Receiving a 
Zika prevention kit was significantly associated with larvicide 
application (odds ratio [OR] 8.0) and bed net use (OR 3.1), 
suggesting the kit’s importance for lesser-known behaviors. 
Offer of free residential spraying was associated with spray­
ing home for mosquitoes (OR 13.1), indicating that women 
supported home spraying when barriers were removed.
I
n early 2016, in response to the rising number of Zika vi­
rus infections in Puerto Rico and the devastating effects 
of Zika infection during pregnancy (1), the Puerto Rico 
Department of Health (PRDOH) activated its emergency 
operations center, with support from the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2). Because there 
is currently no Zika virus vaccine and no known measures 
can prevent prenatal mother-to-child transmission (3), per­
sonal protection measures and home vector control are the 
only feasible protections for most pregnant women. To 
maximize these self-protection behaviors, the response in­
troduced 4 different community Zika prevention behavior 
promotion interventions. Health behavior interventions can 
change behavior by addressing behavioral barriers, by cre­
ating or enhancing incentives, and by increasing persons’ 
capabilities and opportunities to perform the behavior (4).
Interventions
PRDOH Women, Infants, and Children Program 
Zika Orientation
During the tracking period, all newly enrolled pregnant 
women at 1 of the island’s 92 Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC) clinics were given a 20–30-minute presentation on 
Zika virus infection and prevention. Orientation (individu­
ally or in small groups) was provided by the nutrition educa­
tor or, during the peak of the epidemic, by a Zika educator 
provided by CDC. The primary advantages of this counsel­
ing approach are interpersonal communication (including 
answering questions) and how easily it can be integrated into 
existing trusted programs, such as WIC prenatal visits (5,6).
Zika Prevention Kit Distribution
The Zika prevention kit (ZPK) was a tote bag containing in­
sect repellent, condoms, a mosquito bed net, larvicide, and 
printed Zika education materials. Approximately 26,000 
ZPKs were distributed in Puerto Rico (CDC–Puerto Rico 
Department of Health, unpub. data, April 26, 2017). When­
ever possible, the ZPK was given to the pregnant woman 
at the same time as the WIC Zika orientation. Prevention 
kits enable healthy behavior by putting needed items in per­
sons’ hands but also by providing a visual reminder of the 
recommended behavior. Similar home infection prevention 
kits were used during the Zika response in the US Virgin 
Islands (7) and during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa 
(8–10) to provide home caregivers with tools to prevent vi­
rus transmission. Only HIV infection prevention kits have 
been evaluated to date; these preliminary evaluations indi­
cate kit popularity and suggest supportive effects (11,12).

messages through television, radio, print, and social me­
dia channels (13). The television advertisement included 
a montage showing couples or pregnant women and their 
families performing the following behaviors: using repel­
lent, using condoms, using bed nets, removing standing 
water, and installing screens. Mass media campaigns have 
the advantage of reaching multiple audiences (including 
partners, families, and pregnant women not enrolled in 
WIC) with repeating messages that appeal cognitively and 
emotionally by showing relatable images of women taking 
preventive steps and by showing a healthy baby (14).
Offer of Free Residential Mosquito Spraying Services
When pregnant women attended their WIC appointments, 
they were also offered a free residential mosquito spray­
ing service. Upon consent, WIC provided women’s contact 
information to a contracted professional spraying service. 
Across the island, ≈3,400 homes were sprayed through this 
program. For this analysis, this intervention is defined as 
the offer of free residential spraying services, meaning that 
women who report being offered the free service are clas­
sified as exposed to the intervention, regardless of whether 
they chose to use the service. In this way, we can determine 
whether having free residential spraying services available 
affected the overall frequency of spraying the home (or yard) 
for mosquitoes.
Although we might intuit that making residential spray­
ing free would increase use, the literature contains inconsis­
tent evidence about whether removing cost barriers increases 
vector control behavior (15–17). This offer of free residential 
mosquito spraying was discontinued in August 2016 after 
a CDC evaluation found that mosquito populations in and 
around sprayed homes had not changed, probably as a result 
of movement of mosquitoes from nearby homes (18).
Intervention Implementation Monitoring
As these interventions were being implemented, the re­
sponse behavioral science team conducted monthly tele­
phone interviews of a random sample of 300 pregnant 
women participating in WIC to provide feedback to the 
response leadership about intervention exposure and wom­
en’s Zika prevention behavior. A subset of 150 respondents 
were asked about their performance of the following 10 
CDC-recommended behaviors: using mosquito repellent, 
using condoms, abstaining from sex, wearing long-sleeved 
shirts, wearing long pants, sleeping under a bed net, remov­
ing or covering standing water, applying larvicide (in water 
that cannot be removed), putting screens on windows and 
doors, and spraying home and yard for mosquitoes. This 
assessment continued until June 2017, when PRDOH de­
clared the Zika epidemic over (19). During 2016–2017, a 
total of 9 monthly (in 2017, bimonthly) interview rounds 
were conducted. Our analysis addresses the following: 1) 
the proportion of pregnant respondents reached by the 4 
interventions and the factors associated with exposure; 2) 
the Zika prevention behaviors that were most widely prac­
ticed and that were most strongly associated with exposure 
to interventions; and 3) additional factors associated with

how the interventions influenced behavior.
Methods
Interview Population and Sampling
Each month during July–December 2016 and every 2 months 
during February–June 2017, a random sample of 950 preg­
nant women >18 years of age (317 women per pregnancy 
trimester) was drawn from the WIC enrollment database of 
10,000–12,000 women currently enrolled (and not previously 
contacted) for interviews. Vital statistics data indicate that 
87% of women giving birth in Puerto Rico in 2016 were en­
rolled in WIC (Table 1). The calling list was divided among 
interviewers so that some began with first trimester women, 
some with second, and some with third. As part of the Zika 
response, these interviews were determined to be nonresearch 
public health practice and were approved by the US Office 
of Management and Budget (control no. 0920–1196). Be­

RESEARCH
interviewers explained the purpose of the data collection, the 
fact that their participation and all responses would be kept 
confidential, and that they could discontinue the interview any 
time without any penalty. The 3 groups of callers continued 
until 300 total interviews were completed. The interview had 
2 parts, administered 2 weeks apart. Those women who con­
sented to complete part 2 were called in the same order as for 
part 1 until 150 interviews were completed.
Data Collection
The interview consisted of questions about Zika knowledge, 
attitudes, sources of information, exposure to prevention 
interventions, and Zika prevention behaviors. Many of the 
questions involved binary (e.g., yes or no) or scaled (e.g., 
never, rarely, sometimes, frequently, or often) responses. 
Others were questions in which the interviewer did not pro­
vide response options to the participant but coded the re­
sponse according to a checklist. Although Zika infection sta­
tus was not an interview question, if a participant disclosed 
that she was Zika positive, the interview was excluded from 
the dataset. This exclusion was made because Zika virus in­
fection confers immunity and therefore an already positive 
woman would have no reason to take prevention steps.
Definition of Intervention Exposure
Respondents were asked if they had received the WIC Zika 
orientation, the ZPK, or the offer of free home spraying. 
They were also asked if they had seen communications 
from the Detén el Zika campaign. Any woman answering 
affirmatively to any of these questions was defined as ex­
posed to the corresponding intervention.
Data Analysis
Calculation of Zika Prevention Behavior Variables
Because the original interview instrument included multiple 
questions about each Zika prevention behavior without any 
clear formula for integrating question responses into a single 
variable (1 per behavior), analysts had to create such a for­
mula. For example, some questions asked whether a woman 
performed the behavior any time during pregnancy (or during 
the previous day or week) (yes or no), whereas others used 
ordinal frequency scales (e.g., never, sometimes, or always). 
In addition, a Zika prevention behavior could be reported in 
response to the question, “What actions have you taken to 
protect yourself from being infected by the Zika virus?”
To describe women’s Zika prevention behavior as com­
pletely as possible, analysts created behavior variables that 
incorporated 2, 3, or more questions. We prioritized time-
bound, behavior-specific questions, such as, “How often 
did you use mosquito repellent in the past week?” (never, 
sometimes, or always), over a more general question such 
as, “What actions have you taken to protect yourself from 
being infected with the Zika virus?” Among the behavior-
specific questions, those questions with multilevel response 
options were prioritized over yes or no or dichotomous re­
sponse questions, given that the greater number of response 
options yielded more information. Zika prevention behavior 
variables were then created with ordinal scales, combining 
the most detailed behavior-specific question available for the 
behavior with other questions that might serve to increase 
the number of levels of Zika prevention behavior. Once pre­
liminary scales were created, frequencies and plots were re­
viewed by behavioral scientists and epidemiologists involved 
with the Zika response to achieve a consensus on the final 
composition. We have compiled a list of all candidate ques­
tions and final variables (online Technical Appendix, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-1056-Techapp1.pdf).
Statistical Methods
Analysts calculated frequencies of intervention exposure 
by interview month and demographic characteristics. In 
addition, because the interventions sought to increase Zika 
prevention behavior by increasing a woman’s concern 
about Zika, her confidence in her ability to protect herself, 
and involvement of partners and families in Zika preven­
tion, variables representing these constructs were tested for

associations with intervention exposure and Zika preven­
tion behaviors. All analyses were conducted with SPSS 
21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Analysts used logistic regression modeling to estimate 
odds ratios (ORs) for the likelihood of performing recom­
mended Zika prevention behaviors by exposure to 1 of the 
Zika prevention interventions while controlling for the ef­
fects of age, education, pregnancy trimester, poverty, cal­
endar month of interview, and exposure to other interven­
tions. For these models, Zika prevention behavior variable 
responses were collapsed into dichotomous (yes or no) 
variables, indicating whether a respondent had performed 
the ideal behavior (e.g., always uses a condom) or not. In 
the case of mosquito repellent use, the 2 top levels, which 
both include the response always, were combined to make 
the top level.
Because the WIC orientation reached nearly all respon­
dents, the naturally occurring control group of unexposed 
women was very small, causing concerns about small cell 
size in models with many covariates (20). Conversely, a 
small exposure group was a concern with the offer of free 
residential mosquito spraying. Therefore, these 2 interven­
tions were modeled separately from ZPK distribution and 
Detén el Zika, which were modeled together. In addition, 
sparsity concerns led us to consolidate the calendar month 
of interview variable into 1 representing 3-month intervals.

RESEARCH
Among eligible women (i.e., >18 years of age, pregnant, 
and not Zika positive), the response rate was 79%. Age 
and educational attainment distributions of the sample 
were similar to the general population of women giving 
birth in Puerto Rico in 2016 (21), whereas urban resi­
dence is somewhat higher.
Women’s Exposure to 4 Zika Prevention Interventions
Women reported exposure to the 4 interventions as 
follows: WIC Zika orientation (93%), ZPK distribu­
tion (75%), Detén el Zika campaign (51%), and of­
fer of free residential mosquito spraying (68% for the 
months it was running and 34% over the entire period). 
Pregnancy trimester was statistically significant for 
association with exposure to all 4 interventions, whereas 
calendar month of interview was significantly associated 
with 3 interventions (Table 2). No significant associa­
tions were observed in terms of age, education, poverty, 
or rurality.
Graphed by calendar month of interview (Figure 1), 
exposure to the WIC Zika orientation remained consistent­
ly high (89%–96%). ZPK distribution began high (95%), 
dropped in October, then rebounded. Detén el Zika cam­
paign exposure began much lower (37%), then steadily 
increased through October (68%), dropped off, and rose 
again in 2017. Exposure to the offer of free residential mos­
quito spraying started at 70% in July 2016, then dropped 
precipitously after September.

 Zika Prevention and Pregnant Women, Puerto Rico
Intervention exposure was more often significantly 
associated with family or interpersonal communica­
tion variables than with individual risk variables (Table 
3). The same pattern was observed for associations with 
Zika prevention behaviors (data not shown): “frequency 
of talking to family and friends about Zika” was signifi­
cantly associated with 10 behaviors and “aware of Zika 
prevention actions of family” with 5 behaviors, whereas 
all 3 individual risk perception–related variables were as­
sociated with <3 behaviors.
Pregnant Women’s Zika Personal Protection Behaviors
Frequencies of recommended personal protection behav­
iors (i.e., the top level on the ordinal scale) ranged from 4% 
(wearing long-sleeved shirt) to 44% (condom use) (Table 
4). Although just over half of women reported using repel­
lent always, fewer (28%) reported the top category, “used 
always and reported reapplying it.” Among the interven­
tions, exposure to the WIC Zika orientation showed the 
greatest exposed versus not exposed frequency differences 
for the top behavior levels (Tables 4, 5).
Over the monthly interview cohorts, the top level of 
condom use rose steadily with a sustained peak at over 
50%, whereas mosquito repellent use rose to 42%, declined, 
and peaked again in December (Figure 2). Wearing long 
pants had 2 peaks (in October and December) near 30%, 
then a steep decline in 2017, whereas sexual abstinence 
stayed near 20%. Bed net use peaked at 23% in September, 
then fluctuated.
Zika Home Protection Behaviors
We ranked home protection behaviors from the most fre­
quent (removing standing water [90%]) to the least (install­
ing window or door screens [18%]) (Table 5). Over time, 
removing standing water declined slightly through Septem­
ber but then remained at >85%, whereas spraying the home 
for mosquitoes had a steep decline during August–June 
2017 (Figure 3). In contrast, larvicide application began 
low (13%) and then increased through June 2017 (40%).
Independent Associations between Interventions and 
Zika Prevention Behaviors
In multivariable logistic regression models, we observed 
a strong association between the offer of free residential 
mosquito spraying services and spraying the home for mos­
quitoes (Table 6). We also observed strong associations be­
tween ZPK receipt and larvicide application and between 
ZPK receipt and bed net use.
Discussion
For each intervention, exposure patterns corresponded 
with implementation history; WIC orientation exposure 
was consistently high, Detén el Zika campaign exposure 
grew over time, ZPK exposure faltered (because of lo­
gistical problems with kit distribution) and then recov­
ered, and the free offer of home mosquito spraying was 
widely received during the offer period. These largely 
successful implementations illustrate the benefits of col­
laborating with a trusted local partner like WIC. WIC

RESEARCH
was able to incorporate Zika orientations into its regular 
programming, distribute ZPKs effectively, and provide 
the free offer of home spraying during  a WIC visit. WIC 
also played an important role in developing the Detén el 
Zika messaging.
Performance of Zika prevention behaviors varied 
widely. Nearly all women removed any standing water 
that they saw, and about three quarters usually or al­
ways used mosquito repellent, but very few wore long 
sleeves or put up screens. These findings are consistent 
with the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 
Zika Postpartum Emergency Response (PRAMS-ZPER) 
study of postpartum women in Puerto Rico (22). Despite 
important methodologic differences between PRAMS-
ZPER and our analysis, reported frequencies were simi­
lar for mosquito repellent use, removing standing water, 
bed net use, and wearing long sleeves. Where frequencies 
diverged (condom use and spraying home for mosqui­
toes), WIC sample frequencies were more similar to 
PRAMS-ZPER when limited to women in their third tri­
mester. In contrast, interview data from US Virgin Islands 
in late 2016 (7) showed lower frequencies of using repel­
lent, using condoms, removing standing water, and spray­
ing home for mosquitoes. Only data for bed net use were 
similar to the results of our analysis.
Overall, the ZPK distribution had the greatest number 
of independent positive associations with Zika prevention 
behavior and some of the strongest associations. This find­
ing is consistent with a small but growing body of literature 
demonstrating the effectiveness of distributing items for 
encouraging prevention behavior (11,23,24). Prevention 
kits containing prevention products for at-risk populations 
should be considered a best practice, particularly in low-
resource settings.
Larvicide use and bed net use were independently 
associated with ZPK receipt, and distributing items 
associated with these 2 largely unfamiliar behaviors 
probably increased use because women were then able 
to try them. According to Rogers’ diffusion of innova­
tions theory (25), the ability to try a new behavior and 
observe the results enhances the likelihood of adoption. 
Larvicide application might have been further enhanced 
by what Rogers calls “relative advantage”; that is, the 
intervention might have been popular because it was 
easier to implement than the other 3 recommended home 
protection behaviors (removing standing water, install­
ing screens, and spraying home for mosquitoes). Many 
of the ZPKs in the early months of tracking were missing 
larvicide tablets; thus, the dramatic increase in larvicide 
use over the period is not surprising. The finding also 
suggests that the actual association between ZPKs and 
larvicide use is stronger than what our results indicate, 
given that the incomplete kits might have diluted the ob­
served association.

vices was strongly associated with spraying the home

for mosquitoes, enabling women to overcome both cost 
and logistical barriers. Although efficacy concerns led to 
discontinuation of the spraying program, the offer had a 
strong association with spraying behavior, a finding con­
sistent high percentage (81%) of respondents who rated 
the offer of insecticide spraying to pregnant women as 
very important.
The Detén el Zika campaign had the greatest inde­
pendent effect on removing standing water, significant 
effects for repellent use, and modest (marginally signifi­
cant) effects for condom use, whereas the WIC orientation 
appeared to have a slightly greater effect on condom use. 
Although WIC Zika orientation did not yield the same 
large number of positive associations in regression mod­
els as was observed in the bivariate analyses, its highly 
successful implementation left it with a very small natu­
ral control group, which might have limited the utility of 
modeling for this intervention.
As we consider the public health implications of these re­
sults, we should note that in the context of cross-sectional data 
with outcomes that are not rare, ORs do not equate to relative 
risk. Thus, we cannot say that women receiving the free offer 
of home mosquito spraying were 13 times more likely to spray 
their homes. Unfortunately, estimating relative risks from ORs 
is not straightforward. Simple conversion formulas (26) have 
been shown to be imprecise (27), but such conversions can 
provide at least a rough sense of the extent to which relative 
risk is more modest than odds with nonrare outcomes (28). 
For example, the ORs of 8.0 (ZPK exposure and larvicide ap­
plication), 13.1 (offer of free residential spraying and spray­
ing home for mosquitoes), and 3.1 (ZPK exposure and bed net 
use) roughly, convert to risk ratios of 5.2, 3.5, and 2.7, respec­
tively, whereas the more modest ORs of 2.7 (Detén el Zika 
campaign exposure and removing standing water and WIC 
orientation and larvicide application) and 2.4 (WIC orienta­
tion and condom use) undergo a smaller adjustment (1.1, 2.2, 
and 1.7, respectively). Further research is needed to evaluate 
these associations more precisely.
In our exploration of intervention mechanisms, the 2 
interpersonal communication variables showed stronger as­
sociation with the interventions and to the Zika prevention 
behaviors than did the individual variables (Zika concern, 
perceived likelihood of infection, and self-confidence). 
This finding suggests that the interpersonal factors were 
more influential on behavior than individual risk percep­
tions. Interpersonal communication has long been recog­
nized as an important mediator of the effects of educational 
campaigns on health-related behavior change (29–33), and 
our results confirm this assertion.
The main challenge of this analysis was that the data 
were collected during an emergency response for nonre­
search purposes, meaning that much of the analysis design 
had to be created after the fact, particularly the creation 
of Zika behavior outcome variables. Further, this analy­
sis did not use an optimal research design (i.e., there were 
no pre–post groups or predesignated control groups). The 
resulting imbalances in naturally occurring control groups 
prevented the use of a single logistic model for all 4 in­
terventions. However, the use of random sampling from 
a frame representing 87% of the island’s pregnant women

†Models for WIC orientation and offer of free residential spraying were modeled separately, whereas ZPK distribution and Detén el Zika recall were 
modeled together to measure independent effects. Thus, each Zika prevention behavior had 3 models. To reduce possible bias associated with sparse 
data, calendar month of interview was consolidated into a 3-level, 3-month variable. All 5 demographic variables and consolidated calendar month of 
interview were controlled for in each model, except for the following cases: 1) WIC orientation did not include any calendar month of interview variable; or 
2) very few respondents did not receive WIC orientation, thus the naturally occurring control group was very small. To not bias the models, no time of 
interview variable was included in models of WIC orientation. Education was excluded from bed net, larvicide, and repellent use models. Because of the 
substantial amount of missing data for education, additional testing was performed to determine whether women with missing education data performed 
the 10 behaviors with significantly higher or lower frequency. Three behaviors (repellent, bed net, and larvicide use) were significantly associated with 
whether education data were missing, so education was not included in these models. No calendar month or consolidated month variable was used for 
any of the larvicide use models because of small cell sizes.

RESEARCH
and logistic regression modeling to control confounding by 
demographic factors provide a credible first look at pos­
sible effects of Zika prevention interventions during an 
epidemic response.
Among the 4 intervention strategies, ZPK distribu­
tion appears to have significant independent effects on 
the greatest number of Zika prevention behaviors. Con­
sistent with the literature, this intervention should be 
considered a best practice for behavioral support in in­
fectious disease outbreaks, particularly in low-resource 
settings. Social context factors appeared to be more in­
fluential in Zika prevention behavior than personal risk 
assessment and self-efficacy factors, whereas Zika pre­
vention behaviors that enable women to try out lesser-
known behaviors appeared to garner greater acceptance 
than other behaviors. Areas for future research include 
developing the evidence base for Zika prevention be­
havior effectiveness and more precise quantification of 
intervention mechanisms and effects.

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serogroup O80, involved 
in hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with extraintestinal 
infections, has emerged in France. We obtained circularized 
sequences of the O80 strain RDEx444, responsible for hemo­
lytic uremic syndrome with bacteremia, and noncircularized 
sequences of 35 O80 E. coli isolated from humans and ani­
mals in Europe with or without Shiga toxin genes. RDEx444 
harbored a mosaic plasmid, pR444_A, combining extrain­
testinal virulence determinants and a multidrug resistance–
encoding island. All strains belonged to clonal complex 165, 
which is distantly related to other major enterohemorrhagic E. 
coli lineages. All stx-positive strains contained eae-ξ, ehxA, 
and genes characteristic of pR444_A. Among stx-negative 
strains, 1 produced extended-spectrum β-lactamase, 1 har­
bored the colistin-resistance gene mcr1, and 2 possessed 
genes characteristic of enteropathogenic and pyelonephritis 
E. coli. Because O80–clonal complex 165 strains can inte­
grate intestinal and extraintestinal virulence factors in com­
bination with diverse drug-resistance genes, they constitute 
dangerous and versatile multidrug-resistant pathogens.
E
nterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a subset of 
Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC), are major food­
borne pathogens responsible for outbreaks and sporadic cas­
es of gastrointestinal diseases ranging from simple diarrhea 
to hemorrhagic colitis, characterized by bloody diarrhea. The 
most serious complication, particularly in young children, 
is hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), defined by a com­
bination of renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic 
anemia (1). Post-STEC HUS is a major worldwide public 
health concern because it is the primary cause of acute renal 
failure in children (1). These clinical features result mainly 
from the action of the phage-encoded Shiga toxin (Stx), of 
which there are 2 types: Stx1, which has 3 subtypes, Stx1a, 
1c, and 1d; and Stx2, which has 7 subtypes, Stx2a–g. In typi­
cal EHEC, adhesion to the intestinal epithelium is mediated 
by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a chromosomal 
pathogenicity island (PAI), shared with Enteropathogenic 
E. coli (EPEC) strains, which encodes a type III secretion 
system (T3SS), an adhesin called intimin, and its receptor 
Tir. Intimin, encoded by the eae gene, is a major virulence 
factor (VF) involved in the intimate attachment of typical 
EHEC to intestinal epithelium, causing characteristic attach­
ing and effacing lesions. EHEC enterohemolysin (ehxA) is 
a pore-forming cytolysin carried by a plasmid involved in 
EHEC virulence. This plasmid, initially described as part of 
the O157 serogroup (pO157) (2), can carry 2 additional VFs, 
a catalase peroxidase, encoded by katP, and a serine prote­
ase, encoded by espP, which can cleave human coagulation 
factor V and might be involved in the development of hem­
orrhagic colitis (3).
Serogroup O157 is the predominant STEC serogroup 
worldwide, but non-O157 serogroups are increasingly as­
sociated with post-STEC HUS, and the unusual serogroup 
O80 is emerging in France and Europe. In 2016, O80 rep­
resented the second most frequent serogroup isolated in 
France, after serogroup O26 (4). This phenomenon is no 
longer restricted to France; strains of serotype O80:H2, all 
belonging to sequence type (ST) 301, have been identified 
in Spain (5), the Netherlands (6), and Switzerland (7).
This serogroup is unique for several reasons. First, it is 
always associated with multiple determinants of resistance

(i.e., resistance to aminopenicillin, aminoglycoside, na­
lidixic acid, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, or phenicols), 
whereas a resistance phenotype is uncommon among 
EHECs, which are generally fully susceptible to antibiot­
ics, except for rare clones, such as the epidemic O104:H4 
German clone carrying a blaCTX-M-15 gene (8). Furthermore, 
unusual extraintestinal infections have recently been de­
scribed for this serogroup (9,10), such as bacteremia, 
whereas EHEC is generally known to be a strictly intes­
tinal pathogen. A recent case in the Netherlands illustrates 
the potential extreme pathogenicity of this serogroup; a 
16-month-old boy died from multiorgan failure and exten­
sive cerebral thrombotic microangiopathy attributable to an 
O80 Stx2d-producing E. coli strain (6). Finally, O80 EHEC 
appears to be a hybrid pathotype that combines intestinal 
VFs (Shiga toxin [stx], intimin [eae], enterohemolysin 
[ehxA]) and extraintestinal VFs (aerobactin [iucC]; salmo­
chelin [iroN], an iron uptake protein encoded by sitABCD; 
serum resistance protein [issp]; a putative secretion system 
I [etsC]; omptin [ompTp]; hemolysin [hlyF], and 2 bacterio­
cins [cia and cva]), suggesting the presence of a pS88-like 
plasmid (11). pS88 is a ColV plasmid, a key determinant of 
extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli virulence in poultry and 
humans. This plasmid is involved in neonatal meningitis 
(11) and could explain the occurrence of extraintestinal dis­
semination in these EHEC infections. The recent diffusion 
in Europe, high potential extraintestinal pathogenicity, and 
multidrug resistance (MDR) of this hybrid pathotype led us 
to further characterize these strains, which might represent 
a major public health concern.
Methods
We further characterized O80:H2 EHEC by fully sequencing 
a recent representative strain, called RDEx444. RDEx444 
was responsible for a highly severe case of post-STEC HUS, 
complicated by bacteremia, in an 8-month-old infant in Feb­
ruary 2016 in Bourg-en-Bresse, France. Initial symptoms 
were febrile diarrhea with signs of sepsis. Blood and stool 
cultures were positive for O80 EHEC, but urine cultures 
remained negative, suggesting gut translocation that led to 
bacteremia. The appearance of biologic signs of HUS with 
oliguria necessitated transfer to intensive care, several blood 
transfusions, and 5 days of peritoneal dialysis.
We performed sequencing of RDEx444 by using the 
PacBio single-molecule real-time method with RS II chem­
istry 2.4.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA); 
we used 1 single-molecule real-time cell. De novo as­
sembly was performed twice by using the HGAP pipeline 
(https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/Bioinformatics-
Training/wiki/HGAP) and annotation by using the MAGE 
platform 
(http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/
home/index.php) (Figure 1). For this strain, we performed 
plasmid typing by using databases (PlasmidFinder 1.3 and

demiology (CGE) website (http://www.genomicepidemiol­

pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with Southern hy­
bridization and conjugability of the largest confirmed by 
experiments using rifampin-resistant E. coli J53, as previ­
ously described (9).
We also sequenced a representative set of 35 O80 
strains from various sources and countries using the Nex­
tera kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) to prepare 
the library. Sequencing was performed by using a MiSeq 
reagent kit V3 600 cycles (Illumina). This panel included 
human isolates from France (n = 21), Spain (n = 3), and 
Switzerland (n = 2), as well as animal and environmental 
strains isolated in France (n = 3), Spain (n = 1), Slovakia (n 
= 1), and Germany (n = 4) (Figure 2). Some of the human 
strains from France and strains from Spain and Slovakia 
have been partially characterized previously (10). The 
strains from Spain and Slovakia were isolated during 
1998–2012 and the strains from France during 2010–2016. 
The dates of isolation of the strains from Switzerland and 
Germany were not available. We performed assembly by 
using CLC Genomics Workbench software and SPAdes, 
also available on CGE website. The RAST server (http://
rast.nmpdr.org) was used for genome annotation and the 
PHASTER web server (http://phaster.ca) to identify and 
annotate prophage sequences within bacterial genomes and 
plasmids. We established phylogeny by single-nucleotide 
polymorphism alignments between the contigs generated 
by CLC Genomics of O80 strains and 9 reference EHEC 
strain sequences of major serotypes available in GenBank

bor-joining tree was built by using MEGA 3.1 (https://
www.megasoftware.net) using bootstraps calculated from 
100 replicates. The maximum-likelihood method yielded 
the same results (online Technical Appendix Figure 1).
We performed multilocus sequence typing and iden­
tification of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes for all 
strains by using suitable databases available on the CGE 
website (SerotypeFinder 1.1 [14], MLST 1.8 [15], and 
ResFinder 3.0 [16]). Investigation of the resistome was 
completed by using the Resistance Gene Identifier at the 
Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database website 
(https://card.mcmaster.ca/analyze/rgi). 
Moreover, 
166 
genes of intestinal and extraintestinal VFs (list available 
from authors) were assessed by local BLAST+ 2.2.31 anal­
ysis (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Complete results are 
described in online Technical Appendix Figure 2. Nucleo­
tide sequences of the 36 sequenced O80 strains (complete 
nucleotide sequence of RDEx444 and 35 draft nucleotide 
sequences) have been deposited in Genbank (project no. 
PRJNA449634); accession numbers are available in the on­
line Technical Appendix.
Results
RDEx444 can be considered to be representative of hybrid 
pathotype strains because it was responsible for an extrain­
testinal infection and showed similar virulence and resis­
tance profiles as other strains described elsewhere (9,10). 
Complete sequencing yielded 2.3 × 109 bp with 165,041 
reads and an N50 (the length of the smallest contig among 
the set of the largest contigs that together cover >50% of 
the assembly) read length of 19,839 bp.
Four circularized contigs were obtained, including 
the chromosome of 5,256,050 bp, containing 5,146 cod­
ing sequences (CDSs), with an overall G+C content of 
50.7% and 3 plasmids of 176,500 (pR444_A), 117,090 
(pR444_B), and 95,050 bp (pR444_C). The number and 
size of the RDEx444 plasmids were corroborated by S1 
nuclease PFGE (data not shown). We compiled a schematic 
representation of the genetic content, including major VFs, 
of this strain (Figure 1, panel A).
As expected, RDEx444 belongs to serotype O80:H2 
and ST301. Among the 12 prophage regions identified on 
its chromosome, this strain carries a complete Stx-convert­
ing bacteriophage of 43.9 kb. RDEx444 carries the stx2dac­
tivable variant, which has been shown to be predictive of se­
vere clinical outcomes and progression to HUS (17). The 
Stx prophage is integrated into the chromosomal yecE gene, 
a known integration site (18,19), initially reported in a strain 
producing Stx2e, encoded by the phage φP27 (20). The ≈15-
kb region between Stx subunit B and the phage integrase, 
comprising proteins for DNA replication and repression, 
shares strong homology with the phage φP27. RDEx444 is 
otherwise a typical EHEC, given that it harbors a complete 
LEE and does not possess atypical adhesins, such as autoag­
glutinating adhesion (saa) or aggregative factors (aggA/R). 
RDEx444 carries the rare variant of the intimin gene eae-ξ 
(5), which has only very rarely been observed among oth­
er EHEC serotypes, but which is shared by all previously 
described O80 EHEC and EPEC isolates (5–7,9,10). Two 
other chromosomal traits of RDEx444 might also confer 
a selective advantage: 1) a region encoding microcin H47 
(mch A, S, X, B, C, D, E, and F) ≈35 kb downstream from 
the Stx prophage, and 2) a chromosomal mutation in DNA 
gyrase (gyrA S83L), which confers quinolone resistance.
Plasmid pR444_C is 95,050 bp long with a G+C con­
tent of 49.8% and was predicted to contain 114 CDSs. Plas­
mid pR444_C is comparable to pO157 because it contains 
enterohemolysin (ehxA) and serine protease (espP) but 
does not possess catalase peroxidase (katP). Moreover, 2 
other colicines, Ia (cia) and M (cma), are also present on 
this plasmid.
Plasmid pR444_B is 117,090 bp long with a G+C con­
tent of 46.5% and contains 135 CDSs and, unexpectedly, 
those for 3 tRNAs (threonine, asparagine, and tyrosine) re­
dundant with those still present on the chromosome. This 
plasmid can be considered to be cryptic because it carries 
no drug resistance or virulence-associated genes, but sev­
eral phage proteins are present. pR444_B shares high ho­
mology (99% nucleotide identity and 89% coverage) with 
plasmid pECOH89 (21), encoding an extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase blaCTX-M-15 identified in an E. coli strain and be­
longing to the family of phage-like plasmids. Members of 
this family are generally untypeable, nonconjugative, and 
cryptic plasmids, because no known virulence or resistance 
genes have been identified. Their function is unknown, but 
they all have strong homology to the Salmonella-specific 
bacteriophage SSU5 (21).
Plasmid pR444_A is 176,500 bp long, with a G+C 
content of 51.8%, and carries 2 replicons: FII_A and FIB_1 
(ST [F2:A-:B1]). We identified 202 CDSs. This plasmid 
carries virulence-associated genes characteristic of pS88 
(described previously) and MDR genes, and thus can be 
considered to be a mosaic plasmid. We identified an MDR-
encoding region (48,237 bp) in addition to the plasmid-re­
lated function (56,106 bp) and virulence-associated domain 
(72,157 bp), closely related to pS88 (99% nucleotide iden­
tity and 96% query coverage) (11). This MDR-encoding re­
gion contains genes encoding resistance tetracycline (tetA), 
trimethoprim (dfrA5), sulfonamide (sul2), β-lactam (bla­
TEM-IB), kanamycin (aph[3′]-Ia), and streptomycin (strA and 
strB) and resistance against heavy metals such as mercury

(mer gene) (Figure 1, panel B). This resistance cassette has 
only been described for pO26-CRL125 (100% nucleotide 
identity, 98% coverage) from an O26 EHEC but without 
VFs (22). Co-localization of extraintestinal VFs and MDR 
genes on the same plasmid was confirmed by Southern hy­
bridization (data not shown). Moreover, we confirmed that 
this plasmid is conjugative, suggested by the presence on 
the annotation of an almost complete F-like transfer region, 
by successfully conjugating it with rifampin-resistant E. 
coli J53 (data not shown). Thus, this plasmid can diffuse by 
horizontal transfer.
Accordingly, this mosaic plasmid shows high homol­
ogy with plasmid pS88, responsible for extraintestinal 
virulence in neonatal meningitis strains within which a re­
sistance cassette has been integrated (Figure 1, panel B). 
Furthermore, pR444_A also carries 2 bacteriocin genes 
(cia and cva), such as pS88, which might confer a selec­
tive advantage by promoting intestinal establishment and 
colonization by killing other E. coli and freeing up their 
ecologic niches (Figure 1, panel B).
We sequenced a panel of strains consisting of repre­
sentative O80 strains from France and all O80 strains from 
outside of France available at the beginning of the study to 
establish the genetic relationship between O80 strains iso­
lated in several countries in Europe and analyze the diver­
sity of their genetic content. We obtained an average of 233 
contigs, with a mean depth of coverage of 58X and a mean 
N50 of 72,312. Statistics of each sequenced genome are 
summarized in online Technical Appendix Table 1. Single-
nucleotide polymorphism analysis (41,618 sites total) be­
tween the 36 sequenced O80 strains and 9 EHEC strains 
of other major serotypes (O157:H7, O26:H11, O111:H-, 
O103:H2, O55:H7, O91:NM, O104:H4, O145:H28, 
O121:H19) enabled us to establish a phylogenic tree (Fig­
ure 2), which shows 2 main clusters. EHEC O157:H7 
(EDL933) and O55:H7 (2013C-4465) group together, as 
expected by their common origin, demonstrated by Feng et 
al. (23), and are distantly related to the other major EHEC 
serotypes, including the O80 strains. However, O80 iso­
lates clearly form a separate group, suggesting that O80 
emerged independently from the other serogroups. All of 
the O80 strains belong to clonal complex 165 (CC165), 
containing ST301, ST165, and ST189 (Figure 2, panel B).
Almost all of the O80 strains (32/36), including 
RDEx444, belong to the ST301 clonal group of serotype 
O80:H2. All of these isolates have EHEC markers, includ­
ing genes encoded by the LEE, containing the rare variant 
of intimin eae-ξ, ehxA, and stx2a or stx2d genes, except 
for 4 strains missing the stx gene (CB13483, IH43632–03a, 
FV-4476, and VTB262) (online Technical Appendix Fig­
ure 2). However, the presence of the other EHEC mark­
ers in these 4 strains (eae, ehxA/espP, or katP) suggests 
that they were initially STEC and underwent subsequent 
elimination of the stx gene. This finding led us to search 
for a scar of the Stx-converting bacteriophage at the inser­
tion site described in the RDEx444 strain (yecE). We first 
searched for the contig carrying the yecE gene. Then, we 
used the Phaster webserver system to detect phage regions, 
which were finally blasted against RDEx444. We found 
scars of ≈31 kb in the human strain from Spain (IH43632-
03a) and scars of ≈17 kb in the porcine strain from Slovakia 
(FV-4476), similar to the RDEx444 Stx-converting bacte­
riophage (92% and 94% nucleotide identity and 40% and 
56% coverage, respectively) (data not shown). We found 
no scars for the other 2 strains, suggesting either complete 
prophage excision or insertion at another site.
All strains carrying the stx gene (28/36) also possess 
VFs typical of pS88, and all but 1 (CB12623) also carry 
genes conferring resistance to >1 of penicillin, tetracycline, 
kanamycin, or cotrimoxazole. The consistent association 
between extraintestinal VFs typical of pS88 and MDR 
genes, irrespective of the source or country of isolation, 
might suggest the presence of a mosaic plasmid, such as 
in the RDEx444 strain. Although it lacks pS88 markers, 
the water strain from Germany (CB13483) is neverthe­
less multidrug resistant and carries an extended spectrum 
β-lactamase gene (blaCTX-M-1), as well as the mphA gene, 
which confers resistance to azithromycin, the only antimi­
crobial drug that can be used for intestinal decontamination 
of EHEC (24; online Technical Appendix Figure 2).
Among our panel, 3 STEC strains from cattle in France 
clearly belong to this ST301 clonal group. Cattle might 
thus represent an animal reservoir for these hybrid patho-
type strains, given that the isolates possess exactly the same 
VFs (eae, genes of T3SS, ehxA, stx, and determinants of the 
pS88-like plasmid) and resistance genes as human EHECs.
Two clusters (I and II) can be distinguished within the 
ST301 group we describe. The main difference between 
these 2 groups concerns the presence of the unknown cryp­
tic plasmid (pR444_B) in RDEx444. All strains of cluster 
I (n = 25) possess >85% of the genetic determinants of this 
plasmid of unknown function. BLAST results are depicted 
for each strain in online Technical Appendix Table 2. Con­
versely, no strain of group II (n = 7), except 1, has this 
plasmid. No strains of ST165 or ST189 carry it either.
Within cluster I, the pS88-like plasmid carries 2 dis­
tinct gene profiles, showing its plasticity. The 12 Stx2dacti­
vable EHECs isolated from humans in France (designated as 
subcluster Ia in Figure 2) carry the most complete form of 
the plasmid, identical to pS88. The aerobactin iron-uptake 
system, encoded by iuc genes, and the type I secretion sys­
tem, encoded by etsC, are absent from the pS88-like plas­
mid of the subcluster Ib strains.
The second clonal group, ST165, is formed by 1 strain 
(EC_POI) of serotype O80:H19, which is devoid of all VF 
and resistance genes. This isolate might reflect the ancestral

Hybrid Pathotype Shiga Toxin–Producing E. coli O80
origin from which serogroup O80 EHEC strains were de­
rived after the acquisition of diverse VFs.
Finally, clonal group ST189 consists of the 3 avian 
strains of serotype O80:H26 from Germany. None has 
stx or ehxA genes, but all have a complete LEE with 
the variant β1 of the intimin gene (eae). However, none 
of these strains carries the plasmid bfp gene of typical 
EPEC (online Technical Appendix Figure 2). One strain 
(CB13938) has a region of ≈27 kb at the same insertion 
site (yecE gene) that shares homology with RDEx444 
Stx-converting bacteriophage (88% nucleotide identity, 
16% coverage), suggesting a potential scar of Stx-con­
verting phage. Thus, this strain could have been origi­
nally an EHEC which secondarily lost its stx gene. No 
similar regions were found in the other 2 strains of this 
group. Otherwise, 1 strain (CB15046) has several VFs, 
confirming the presence of the pS88-like plasmid with 
MDR genes. The other 2 strains (CB15387 and CB13938) 
carry the locus encoding the siderophore yersiniabactin 
(fyuA), also called the high-pathogenicity island; these 2 
strains also have pyelonephritis-associated pili with Pap­
GII adhesin (online Technical Appendix Figure 2). These 
strains constitute another type of hybrid pathotype with 
intestinal and extraintestinal VFs. Although none of them 
has VFs typical of pS88 plasmids, CB13938 is multidrug-
resistant and carries the recently described mcr-1 plasmid 
gene (25), conferring resistance to colistin. Blast analysis 
performed with the contig containing mcr-1 (10.119 bp) 
shows strong homology (100% coverage, 99% identity) 
with 2 chromosomal insertion sites previously described 
in strains Mbl323 and Mbl506 (26).
Discussion
We deciphered the molecular characteristics of O80:H2–
CC165 EHEC, an emerging hybrid pathotype diffusing 
throughout Europe. This pathotype is armed to spread by 
means of a conjugative plasmid combining extraintesti­
nal virulence with resistance to nearly all major classes 
of antibiotics, improved by the presence of several plas­
mid and chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, such as 
colicines I, V, M, and H47. We used the same criteria of 
MDR as a recent study in England (27) (blaTEM-1, strA-
strB, sul1/sul2/dfrA, and tetA) and showed that 93% 
(26/28) of O80 STEC have this genotypic resistance pro­
file, whereas only 5% of the strains identified within the 
O157 and O26 serogroups in the study in England had 
such a profile. MDR observed with this hybrid pathotype 
might complicate patient care, and the use of antimicro­
bial drugs during EHEC infections is still a subject of 
debate (28). However, the occurrence of invasive infec­
tions, such as bacteremia during EHEC infections, with 
this clone warrants antimicrobial treatment for such in­
fections. In a previous study, the observed Stx rate was 
lower with a combination of azithromycin and ceftriax­
one assays relative to basal secretion, and we proposed 
this association for the treatment of such infections (10).
Such a troubling plasmid has never been identified in 
human EHEC isolates. The only example of a similar mo­
saic plasmid was reported for S. enterica serovar Kentucky, 
in which an AmpC β-lactamase gene (blaCMY-2) was inte­
grated into a pS88-like plasmid (29). The insertion of an 
MDR-encoding island in a pS88-like plasmid containing 
extraintestinal virulence genes is particularly worrisome. 
Massive and inappropriate use of veterinary antibiotics, 
such as tetracycline, in food-animal production promotes 
antimicrobial drug resistance among animals, known to be 
reservoirs for STEC. This practice can select and favor the 
spread of such MDR plasmids in human EHECs. Tetracy­
cline still represented 36.5% of the tonnage of veterinary 
antibiotic use in 2015 in France (30). In our panel, all the 
sequenced O80 STEC strains carry the tetA gene, confer­
ring resistance to tetracycline. Thus, large veterinary use of 
this drug might favor the selection of these hybrid strains 
and increase their diffusion.
We indicated a potential reservoir of these hybrid pa­
thotype strains when we identified 3 O80:H2 strains isolated 
from cattle that carry the same VFs and resistance genes as 
human strains. However, the presence of the CC165 strains 
in chickens suggest that this clonal complex is also adapted 
to poultry. An initial description of pS88-like plasmids in 
avian pathogenic E. coli strains reinforces this hypothesis 
(31). Moreover, the environmental survival of this clone 
in these potential reservoirs might be enhanced because of 
the resistance to mercury shared by all but 1 strain (36047), 
all carriers of the pS88-like plasmid, irrespective of their 
origin. Such resistance to heavy metals has been rarely de­
scribed in EHEC strains (22).
We also detected an O80:H19–CC165 strain devoid 
of virulence genes, which might represent the ances­
tral precursor of CC165, and from which these hybrid 
pathotype strains might have been derived. This strain 
could be used for tracing the genetic history of this clone 
in future studies.
Our genetic description of the emerging hybrid patho-
type E. coli O80:H2, associated with O80-related strains, 
reveals the outstanding capacity of O80–CC165 to acquire 
the combination of virulence genes involved in intestinal 
and extraintestinal pathogenicity and genes conferring 
broad antibiotic resistance, including extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase–encoding genes and those most recently iden­
tified, such as mcr-1. O80–CC165 strains, which are able 
to integrate multiple VFs with various consequences, MDR 
genes that encompass nearly all classes, and bacteriocins, 
represent a serious threat because of their exceptional ver­
satility and should therefore be closely monitored in all 
countries in Europe.

We analyzed the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) 
H5 epizootic of 2016–17 in Europe by epidemiologic and 
genetic characteristics and compared it with 2 previous epi­
zootics caused by the same H5 Guangdong lineage. The 
2016–17 epizootic was the largest in Europe by number of 
countries and farms affected and greatest diversity of wild 
birds infected. We observed significant differences among 
the 3 epizootics regarding region affected, epidemic curve, 
seasonality, and outbreak duration, making it difficult to 
predict future HPAI epizootics. However, we know that in 
2005–06 and 2016–17 the initial peak of wild bird detec­
tions preceded the peak of poultry outbreaks within Europe. 
Phylogenetic analysis of 2016–17 viruses indicates 2 main 
pathways into Europe. Our findings highlight the need for 
global surveillance of viral changes to inform disease pre­
paredness, detection, and control.
H
ighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a zoonotic 
notifiable disease that can cause high mortality rates 
in most domestic poultry and in some wild bird species. 
Since 2003, HPAI H5 viruses have been circulating in poul­
try in many countries (1). Periodically these poultry HPAI 
viruses have been reintroduced into the wild migratory bird 
population, representing a key risk pathway for its subse­
quent global spread (1–3). However, the effect of HPAI 
infection in both wild and domestic birds is variable and 
often strain-specific. Wild birds, particularly of the orders 
Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, are natural hosts of low 
pathogenicity avian influenza (4).
A passive surveillance system of testing wild birds 
found dead or sick for avian influenza has been in place in 
European Union (EU) member states since 2005 (Commis­
sion Decision 2005/94/EC, replaced with 2010/367/EU), 
with the objective of timely detection of HPAI subtype 
H5N1. Laboratory confirmation of HPAI infection follow­
ing the development of clinical signs (passive surveillance) 
is the primary method of poultry surveillance in the EU 
member states, complemented by a serologic active sur­
veillance program (5).
During epidemiologic year 2005–06 (epidemiologic 
years run from October to September of the next year),

HPAI H5N1 clade 2.2 virus of the Guangdong H5 lineage 
spread to a number of countries in Europe, infecting poul­
try and wild bird populations (3). In 2014–15, another vi­
rus of the same lineage, HPAI H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4, was in­
troduced into Europe and associated with variable disease 
severity, including subclinical infection in wild birds and 
domestic waterfowl (6). This H5N8 virus showed unprec­
edented intercontinental spread to the United States and 
Canada and was associated with both wild bird infection 
and, subsequent to local genetic reassortment, large HPAI 
H5N2 outbreaks in poultry (7). 
In October 2016, a novel HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 virus 
of the Guangdong lineage was detected in Hungary and was 
subsequently reported in other countries in Europe, infect­
ing many poultry farms and causing both large-scale and 
sporadic deaths in wild bird populations. The hemagglu­
tinin (HA) gene of this virus was considered phylogeneti­
cally distinct from the previous 2014 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses 
and was nominally suffixed by A (the 2016 clade) or B (the 
2014 clade (8) but this subclade definition requires verifi­
cation by the World Health Organization H5 nomenclature 
group. We describe the epidemiology and genetic charac­
teristics of the 3 major wild-bird mediated epizootics in 
Europe associated with the Guangdong HPAI H5 lineage.
Methods
Epidemiologic Data and Analyses
We collected data from the 3 major HPAI H5 epizootics 
in Europe: HPAI H5N1 in epidemiologic year 2005–06 
(2); HPAI H5N8 in 2014–15; and HPAI H5 in 2016–17. 
For 2016–17, we collected data through July 31, 2017. We 
obtained epidemiologic data from the Animal Disease No­
tification System and the Directorate-General for Health 
and Food Safety, managed by the European Commission, 
and from country notifications sent to the EU Reference 
Laboratory for avian influenza (Animal and Plant Health 
Agency, Weybridge, UK).
We conducted analyses to describe each epizootic, 
examined the geographic and temporal spread (epidemic 
curves), and assessed differences in clinical illness and 
death rates. For spatial analysis, we grouped countries into 
4 regions (North, South-West, South-East, and Central Eu­
rope) on the basis of the broad migration patterns of the 
major migratory water bird species affected by HPAI (on­
line Technical Appendix Figure 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/
EID/article/24/12/17-1860-Techapp1.pdf) (9–14). A full 
description of the methods used is presented in the online 
Technical Appendix.
Viruses’ Sequence Data and Phylogenetic Analyses
We obtained virus HA gene sequence data from coun­
tries’ submissions to the EU Reference Laboratory and 
from GISAID (http://platform.gisaid.org.) We performed 
phylogenetic analyses on HA sequence data from each 
epizootic separately. We used IQ-TREE version 1.5.5 
software (15) to infer maximum-likelihood trees with 
approximate likelihood ratio test (1,000 replicates) and 
bootstrap (100 replicates) support values for branches. 
We down-sampled each dataset using Cluster Database 
at High Identity with Tolerance to remove sequences with 
>99.9% sequence identity (16). We performed root-to-
tip regression analyses using Tempest version 1.5 on the 
downsampled datasets (17). Then, we inferred Bayesian 
phylogenetic trees from each downsampled dataset using 
BEAST version 1.8.4 to determine the mean substitution 
rate and TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) 
(18). We annotated the final trees using FigTree version 
1.4.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Details 
of criteria and priors used in the analyses are provided in 
the online Technical Appendix.
Results
Epizootic Size  
In 2016–17, a total of 1,108 poultry outbreaks were reported 
in 21 countries in Europe. Extensive farm-to-farm spread, 
predominantly in ducks, seemed apparent in France, which 
had >400 farms affected, and Hungary, with >200 farms in­
fected (19). Conversely, in 2005–06, a total of 230 poultry 
outbreaks occurred in 6 countries, mostly located in Roma­
nia (86%) and Hungary (13%). In 2014–15, only 13 poultry 
outbreaks were reported in 5 countries. The estimated num­
ber of poultry culled was 8 times higher in 2016–17 than in 
2005–06 (Table 1).
The number of wild bird detections was substantially 
different between epizootics: 1,559 incidents in 27 coun­
tries in 2016–17, 487 in 18 countries in 2005–06, and only 
5 in 3 countries in 2014–15. Almost half of the wild bird 
incidents reported in all 3 epizootics were in Germany.
Wild Birds Species and Mass Mortality Events
A total of 49 different wild bird species were reported in­
fected with HPAI H5 virus of the Guangdong lineage in 
2016–17, 28 in 2005–06, and 6 in 2014–15 (Table 2,3). 
Swans (Cygnus spp.), particularly mute swans (Cygnus 
olor), were the most frequent species infected in 2005–
06 (41% of all wild birds) and 2016–17 (20% of all wild 
birds). Ducks were the second most common type of wild 
birds infected. In 2005–06 and 2016–17, tufted duck (Ay­
thya fuligula) was the most frequent duck species detected 
positive (5% of all wild birds). In 2005–06, a total of 28 
(6%) mass mortality events (>5 birds dead in 1 location) 
were reported, whereas 112 (7%) mass mortality events 
were reported in 2016–17; none were reported in 2014–15 
(online Technical Appendix Figure 2). The number of wild

birds found dead by incident was significantly different be­
tween epizootics (p<0.001 by Mann-Whitney U test).
Type of Poultry Farm and Clinical Manifestations
The types of poultry infected in each epizootic are shown 
in Table 4. In 2016–17, a large proportion of infected 
farms (40%) kept ducks. In 2005–06, many affected back­
yard flocks in Romania (176/230, 77%) had <100 birds, 
whereas 70% (9/13) of poultry farms infected in 2014–15 
had >10,000 birds and >60% in 2016–17 had >1,000 birds 
(difference in flock size distribution, p<0.001 by Kruskal-
Wallis test). When we excluded Romania from the com­
parison of flock size, there was no statistical difference in 
flock size between 2005–06 and 2016–17 (online Technical 
Appendix Figure 3). 
Ducks, geese, turkeys, and broiler chickens on average 
had higher illness rates in 2005–06 than in the other epizoot­
ics (Figure 1). In 2016–17, average mortality rate was lowest 
in ducks (7%) and turkeys (6%); few farms (<5%) reported 
a >25% mortality rate. In contrast, 32% of affected broiler 
farms and 27% of affected layer farms reported mortality 
rates >25%. In 2005–06, more than half of broiler farms re­
ported mortality rates >25%. When comparing overall esti­
mates, we found the observed poultry illness and death rates 
to be substantially higher in 2005–06 than in 2016–17.
Temporal Spread
We determined the epidemiologic curves of the 3 epizootics 
(Figure 2, panels A–C). In 2016–17, H5 was first detected 
in Europe in a mute swan in Hungary; the first outbreak in

*Table includes all reported HPAI H5N8 outbreaks through July 31, 2017. It excludes the new wave of secondary H5N8 outbreaks observed in Italy from 
the beginning of July 2017 through September 2017, which has different drivers and kinetics with maintenance in the poultry (primarily turkey) population 
rather than through wild bird introduction. FYROM, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; HPAI, highly pathogenic avian influenza.  
†It is uncertain if for some outbreaks only the number of poultry in one farm building or if the poultry population in the area of the farm were reported. This 
estimate should be used as an approximation and indicator of impact. 
‡One observation contained 600,000 birds, representing the overall population of backyard flocks affected in Romania. This number is an approximation. 
§These countries did not submit data to the Animal Disease Notification System in 2005–06; however, there is other evidence of H5N1 incursion in the 
period.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5 in Europe
poultry was detected 11 days later in a turkey farm, also in 
Hungary. We observed 3 major epidemic peaks on the inci­
dence of poultry outbreaks (Figure 2, panel D): on day 54 
(14.9 outbreaks/wk), following large farm-to-farm spread 
in Hungary; day 79 (12.1 outbreaks/wk) caused by farm-
to-farm transmission in France and Bulgaria; and on day 
121 (16.9 outbreaks/wk), caused by the large farm-to-farm 
spread in France and Poland.
In 2005–06 and 2016–17, a peak in wild bird inci­
dents preceded the peak in poultry outbreaks (Figure 2, 
panel A, C). Statistical analysis of the distribution of the 
epidemic curves indicates that the 2016–17 outbreak had 
significantly higher incidence values (p<0.001 by 2-sample 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) than the other 2 epizootics; 
2005–06 had significantly higher values (p<0.001 by 
2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) than 2014–15. Tem­
poral median of the poultry epizootic was substantially 
different between epizootics (mean/median distance for 
2005–06, 189/223 days; for 2014–15, 33.5/26; for 2016–
17,  92/90 days). Seasonal analysis of poultry outbreaks 
indicates significant differences (p<0.001 by Pearson χ2 
test) between epizootics; >50% of poultry outbreaks oc­
curred in May in 2005–06, in November in 2014–15, and 
in December–February in 2016–17 (Figure 2, panel E).

that, in the first 2 months of the 2016–17 epizootic, 2 different 
viral incursions may have occurred: one spreading through 
Hungary, Croatia, Switzerland, and southern Germany, and 
another spreading in northern Europe (Poland, Denmark, 
northern Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands). The 
2005–06 epizootic indicated a similar progression pattern, 
initiating in Romania and spreading up to northern Europe 
and down to southeastern Europe (Figure 3).
Comparison by region of Europe according to wild 
bird migratory patterns indicates poultry outbreaks were 
mostly observed in the South-East and South-West re­
gions in 2005–06 and 2016–17 but in the North in 2014–15 
(online Technical Appendix Figure 4). Most wild bird de­
tections were reported in the North and Central regions. 
Poultry detections by region were significantly different 
for the 3 epizootics (p<0.001 by Pearson χ2 test), whereas 
wild bird detections by region were only significantly dif­
ferent (p<0.001 by Pearson χ2 test) between 2005–06 and 
2016–17.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Genetic analysis of the HA gene for the 2014–15 and 2016–
17 epizootics shows the involvement of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 
in all cases where data were available (Figure 6). Patterns 
found in maximum-likelihood trees are largely in agreement 
with the Bayesian analysis; however, a greater proportion 
of the clades remain unresolved in the maximum-likelihood 
trees (Figure 6; online Technical Appendix Figure 8). The

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5 in Europe
2016–17 viruses form a distinct clade and can be clearly dif­
ferentiated from the clade 2.3.4.4. viruses present in Europe 
in 2014–15. In agreement with the geospatial results, analy­
sis of the HA gene of the viruses from the 2016–17 epizootic 
shows that most originate from a common progenitor (time 
to most recent common ancestor estimated May 2014–Au­
gust 2015) (online Technical Appendix Figure 8). However, 
these viruses differ in their evolutionary pathway thereafter, 
evolving in 2 co-circulating subclades without clear geo­
graphic restriction (time to most recent common ancestor 
March 2015–August 2016 [0.9 posterior probability] and 
November 2014–October 2015 [0.82 posterior probability]). 
This finding potentially indicates 2 major incursion path­
ways via wild birds. 
We also found smaller clusters and singleton se­
quences including sequences from European viruses; vi­
ruses from 2014–15 form 1 subclade, estimated to have 
emerged in January–February 2014 (Figure 6; online 
Technical Appendix Figure 8). The 2005–06 data show 
viruses in several subclades, but the branching pattern in

this dataset is generally less distinct and many sequences 
remain unresolved.
BEAST analyses (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/
beast/) also revealed that the 2014–15 epizootic viruses 
show the highest mean substitution rate (measured per site 
per year), followed by 2016–17 and then by the 2005–06 
epizootic, which is significantly lower (one-way analysis 
of variance p<0.001) (online Technical Appendix Figure 
6). These data are in agreement with the results of the root-
to-tip regression analysis (online Technical Appendix Fig­
ure 7), which show a much steeper slope for the 2014–15 
epizootic compared with the others. However, the spread 
of the data is high for the 2016–17 epizootic, where the 
SD of rates is an order of magnitude higher than that for 
the 2014–15 epizootic and 2 orders greater than for the 
2005–06 outbreak. The nucleotide diversity for each epizo­
otic (online Technical Appendix Figure 9) shows that per-
site diversity (average pairwise nucleotide differences in a 
population) is lowest in the 2005–06 epizootic (0.0038), 
consistent with the lower substitution rate inferred from 
BEAST. The 2014–15 epizootic has the highest diversity 
(0.0086); the rate for 2016–17, calculated from viruses col­
lected through June 2017, is 0.0063.
Discussion
The 2016–17 epizootic of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 vi­
ruses in Europe has 5 times more outbreaks in poultry 
than observed in the H5 clade 2.2 epizootic in 2005–06 
and 80 times more than in the H5 clade 2.3.4.4 epizo­
otic in 2014–15. This study highlights the unprecedented

magnitude of the 2016–17 HPAI H5 epizootic in Europe, 
in terms of size (both number of poultry outbreaks and 
wild bird incidents), geographic spread, speed of inci­
dents/outbreaks, and diversity of wild bird species re­
ported infected. As a result, the economic impact is many 
times higher for 2016–17, which resulted in an >8-fold 
increase in poultry that died or were culled.
A greater passive surveillance effort to detect influenza 
virus in wild birds was reported in the EU in 2006 than in 
2016 (20,21). Despite reduced passive surveillance efforts in 
recent years, more virus detections were made in wild birds 
in calendar year 2016 compared with 2006, indicating a like­
ly increase in viral burden within bird populations in Europe, 
leading to an increased risk for incursion into poultry. Al­
though we found a lower rate of substitution and diversity in 
2016–17 compared with 2014–15, the viruses in the 2016–17 
epizootic might be more efficient in capacity to adapt and 
infect avian hosts. Different rates and diversity between

2005–06 and the 2 more recent epizootics may be caused 
by overall differences in the H5 lineages (clade 2.2 versus 
2.3.4.4), which could influence viral spread. The greater ge­
netic distances we observed in viruses detected in the 2014–
15 epidemic could also be due to lower sensitivity of surveil­
lance for this virus compared with the other 2 epidemics due 
to an apparently lower mortality rate in wild birds.
Extensive secondary spread is the most probable ex­
planation for the large number of outbreaks reported in the 
farmed duck sector in 2016–17, possibly because of rapid 
attenuation of viral symptoms. Hence, on several farms 
with clinically healthy birds, we detected HPAI infections 
through active epidemiologic tracings and not on the ba­
sis of clinical signs, as reported in data from some mem­
ber states. The results may also indicate that infection and 
transmission between domestic ducks is relatively easy for 
these viruses. The type of husbandry practices and frequent 
movement of birds, coupled with poor biosecurity and lack

of robust hygiene practices, may also make the spread of 
the viruses between farms easier (22).
Swans and ducks were the predominant hosts in­
fected in 2005–06 and 2016–17. Of interest, although 
mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are the most frequently 
tested in EU passive surveillance (4), tufted ducks (Ay­
thya fuligula) were the most commonly identified species 
of duck with HPAI in 2005–06 and 2016–17. In addition, 
the 2016–17 epizootic demonstrated a much expanded 
wild bird host range compared with previous outbreaks. 
In light of these results, we recommend a review of the 
target species for avian influenza surveillance (5) to im­
prove sensitivity of surveillance. Clarifying the precise 
origins of the current epizootic viruses from reported wild 
bird mortality data is problematic, because these data do 
not allow distinction between migratory carrier species 
and resident sentinel species. Many of the reported spe­
cies are not migratory (e.g., mute swan or little grebes) 
and so might play a role as regional amplifiers of viruses 
but not in long-distance spread (23).

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5 in Europe
Epidemic curves for the 3 epizootics were significantly 
different. The incidence values in order of magnitude were 
2016–17 > 2005–06 > 2014–15. In the period of the re­
view, the mean temporal distances to the midpoint in the 
poultry epizootic were different; 2014–15 was relatively 
short, consistent with the incursion into the poultry sector 
and potentially lower virus infectivity present in the wild 
bird reservoir, whereas in 2005–06 and in 2016–17, epi­
demic curves show a clear peak of detection of wild bird 
incidence preceding the peak of poultry incidences, which 
demonstrates the importance of wild bird surveillance.
For the 2016–17 epizootic, the epidemic curve shows a 
long extended tail with small sporadic peaks relating to lo­
calized but limited detection and spread in both poultry and 
wild birds (Figure 2, panel C). These data might suggest 
greater infection pressure from migratory birds in 2016–17, 
leading to higher risks for incursion, greater environmen­
tal contamination, and exposure of local indigenous wild 
bird populations and poultry. The observed spatiotemporal 
relationships between poultry incursions and wild bird de­
tections represent a complex dynamic. Exploration of the 
epidemic curves by country in 2016–17 shows important 
differences that relate to the type of poultry production in­
fected (online Technical Appendix Figure 7). For example, 
we detected infections in Hungary relatively early in the 
epizootic; their rapid peak and decline may reflect exten­
sive infection within the major duck-producing regions and 
less susceptible populations through infection and depopu­
lation. In contrast, infection in Germany and Poland was 
more consistent and may reflect a more continuous expo­
sure and incursion risk into a variety of poultry sectors.
The viruses showed close genetic similarity to viruses 
contemporaneously circulating in Central and Southeast 
Asia. The lower genetic diversity observed in 2016–17 
was accompanied by reassortment of all gene segments, as 
shown in previous studies (8,24,25). The high reassortment 
observed in the 2016–17 epizootic also resulted in novel 
NA reassortants such as the H5N6 and H5N5 viruses. The 
H5N6 viruses circulating in Europe were a reassortant of 
HPAI H5N8 and classical European LPAI present in wild 
birds (data not shown). We can clearly differentiate the ge­
netic characteristics of this strain from viruses known to be 
circulating in poultry and wild birds in the Far East with 
occasional spillover to humans.
Epidemiologic results suggest 2 broad corridors of vi­
rus incursion in 2005–06 and 2016–17, through northern 
and central Europe with subsequent spread, later corrobo­
rated through phylogenetic analyses of the HA gene of the 
viruses from the 2016–17 epizootic. This dual incursion 
probably relates broadly to known postbreeding move­
ments of northern duck species, which breed widely across 
northern Eurasia (11,13,26). These movements occur on 
a broad front, but ringing recoveries and other analyses 
demonstrate movements from breeding areas from Sibe­
ria both southwest toward the Black and Aegean Seas and 
ultimately the coastal wetlands of the eastern Mediterra­
nean, and further north and west through the Baltic Sea to 
coastal and other wetlands of the southern North Sea and 
northwestern countries (11–14). These represent migratory 
tendencies only; several studies have shown the high-level 
complexity of these movements and their variation due to 
both short-term weather patterns and longer-term climate 
change (27,28). The fact that these corridors were appar­
ent in 2 temporally distant epizootics suggests the need for 
further research to focus surveillance in these areas.
This study presents many limitations (online Techni­
cal Appendix). Differences in the implementation of pas­
sive wild bird surveillance between countries, which are 
implied in the EU avian influenza annual report for 2016 
(20), suggest that sensitivity of wild bird surveillance var­
ies across countries (29), which could affect the distribu­
tion of cases we observed. The true probability of detect­
ing HPAI is dependent on many factors that may influence 
both the frequency of wild bird deaths and the likelihood 
of identification and sampling of wild bird carcasses in dif­
ferent regions and countries. Public awareness, the current 
avian influenza status of the country area, media coverage, 
prevailing climatic conditions, available food sources, and 
removal by predators may affect wild bird mortality, detec­
tion rates, or both (30). Furthermore, the efficacy of pas­
sive surveillance is difficult to measure because capturing 
the expended effort depends on observation and testing of 
deceased birds. On the other hand, surveillance has high 
sensitivity in farmed poultry, mainly because of higher vir­
ulence and much closer observation of these populations.
Despite apparent heavy infection pressure in wild birds 
in 2016–17, the virus was not detected early in the epizo­
otic in areas in eastern Europe, such as the Danube Delta, 
with high density of early migratory waterfowl. There were 
significant incursions in poultry in northern Europe, par­
ticularly Germany and Poland, and these areas also report­
ed the greatest number of infected wild birds. This finding 
may reflect the implementation of enhanced surveillance 
in wild bird populations rather than true increased risk. 
Southwestern Europe had relatively few wild bird detec­
tions compared to the number of poultry outbreaks, per­
haps because of the establishment of the virus in the duck 
production sector in southwestern France, not as a result of 
increased introductions from wild birds (31).
The extent of the 2016–17 H5 epizootic indicates an 
urgent need to reappraise the effectiveness of surveillance 
strategies in both wild and domestic birds and to monitor 
key populations for emergence of viral variants. The dif­
ferences we observed in the 3 epizootics illustrate the dif­
ficulty of predicting HPAI epizootics. However, the tem­
poral peak of wild bird detections preceding the peak of

poultry outbreaks at the EU level highlighted the utility of 
surveillance in wild birds, as observed in other studies (29). 
The spatial corridors of HPAI we identified may provide 
the basis for an increase in targeted surveillance to improve 
system sensitivity. Although the H5N8, H5N5, and H5N6 
European-reassortant viruses have not been shown to infect 
humans and remain avian influenza–like strains with no 
evidence of key mammalian adaptation markers (27), their 
genetic volatility represents a potential threat that requires 
continuous monitoring and surveillance of virus incidence 
and genetics to continue to protect public safety.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) confer resis­
tance to clinically important third-generation cephalospo­
rins, which are often used to treat invasive salmonellosis. 
In the United States, ESBLs are rarely found in Salmonel­
la. However, in 2014, the US Food and Drug Administra­
tion found blaCTX-M-65 ESBL-producing Salmonella enterica 
serotype Infantis in retail chicken meat. The isolate had 
a rare pulsed-field gel eletrophoresis pattern. To clarify 
the sources and potential effects on human health, we 
examined isolates with this pattern obtained from hu­
man surveillance and associated metadata. Using broth 
microdilution for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and 
whole-genome sequencing, we characterized the iso­
lates. Of 34 isolates, 29 carried the blaCTX-M-65 gene with <9 
additional resistance genes on 1 plasmid. Of 19 patients 
with travel information available, 12 (63%) reported recent 
travel to South America. Genetically, isolates from travel­
ers, nontravelers, and retail chicken meat were similar. 
Expanded surveillance is needed to determine domestic 
sources and potentially prevent spread of this ESBL-
containing plasmid.
A 
leading cause of bacterial foodborne disease in the 
United States is nontyphoidal Salmonella (1). Sal­
monella enterica serotype Infantis (hereafter called Sal­
monella Infantis) is one of the most common Salmonella 
serotypes in the United States and 1 of 3 serotypes for 
which incidence has substantially increased (by 60%) 
in the past 10 years (2). Salmonella Infantis has been 
identified in a variety of foods, animals, and environ­
mental settings.
Salmonellosis usually causes a self-limited gastro­
enteritis; however, current guidelines recommend that 
antimicrobial therapy be considered for groups of persons 
at increased risk for invasive infection. For those patients, 
treatment with ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole, or amoxicillin is recommended (3). 
Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) confer resis­
tance to most third-generation cephalosporins and peni­
cillins, including ampicillin.
Some Enterobacteriaceae produce CTX-M ESBLs, 
which are encoded by blaCTX-M genes that were discovered 
in 1989 (4). Since then, their prevalence has increased dra­
matically (5) and they have been isolated worldwide, pri­
marily from Escherichia coli (6). Identification of ESBLs, 
including the CTX-M types, in Salmonella in the United 
States is relatively rare (7,8).
In the United States, the National Antimicrobial Re­
sistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a surveillance 
system that tracks changes in the antimicrobial suscepti­
bility of certain enteric bacteria isolated from ill persons, 
retail meats, and food animals. In July 2015, the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) notified the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a CTX-M-65–
producing Salmonella Infantis strain isolated from retail 
chicken meat in December 2014 (9). The isolate had a rare 
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern, JFXX01.0787 
(pattern 787). To clarify the sources and potential effects 
of this strain on human health, we analyzed data from sev­
eral CDC surveillance systems to describe the prevalence, 
epidemiology, antimicrobial drug resistance, and molecu­
lar phylogenetics of Salmonella Infantis pattern 787 iso­
lates from humans.

Methods
Background Rates
To determine the expected demographics, rates of hos­
pitalization, and international travel among patients with 
Salmonella Infantis infections compared with patients with 
infections caused by other common nontyphoidal Salmo­
nella serotypes, we analyzed data collected through the 
Foodborne Disease Active Surveillance Network (Food­
Net; 
https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/index.html) 
during 
2012–2015. Begun in 1996, FoodNet has conducted ac­
tive, population-based surveillance for culture-confirmed 
cases of infection caused by 9 pathogens transmitted com­
monly through food, including Salmonella. FoodNet is 
a collaboration of CDC, 10 state health departments, the 
US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection 
Service (USDA-FSIS), and the FDA. The FoodNet surveil­
lance area includes 15% of the US population; these data 
are used to estimate the burden of US foodborne illnesses, 
hospitalizations, and deaths (1). We defined other common 
nontyphoidal Salmonella as the top 20 S. enterica serotypes 
(excluding Infantis) isolated from humans: Typhimurium, 
Enteritidis, Newport, Heidelberg, Javiana, Saintpaul, Mon­
tevideo, Agona, Oranienburg, Muenchen, Thompson, Ha­
dar, Braenderup, Derby, I 4,[5],12:i:-, Paratyphi B var. 
L(+) tartrate+, Blockley, Anatum, Mississippi, and Pana­
ma. These 20 serotypes represented 69% of nontyphoidal 
Salmonella isolates reported to FoodNet in 2015.
Case Finding
We looked for pattern 787 isolates reported to the National 
Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Sur­
veillance (PulseNet; https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/index.
html) through 2017. The PulseNet database contains pulsed-
field gel electrophoresis patterns from state and local public 
health laboratories and food regulatory agencies. Only the 
first isolate from each patient was included in case counts.
CDC also requested patient data and clinical isolates 
from state and local public health departments for any case 
with pattern 787 reported through October 2015. Patient 
data included age, sex, date of symptom onset, hospital­
ization, and recent international travel (defined as travel 
outside of the United States in the 7 days before symptom 
onset). Isolate data included specimen collection date(s) 
and source.
Isolate Characterization
We used the NARMS standard broth microdilution pro­
tocol (Sensititer; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Oakwood Vil­
lage, OH, USA) to determine the MICs for 14 antimicrobial 
agents: gentamicin, streptomycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/
clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, azithro­
mycin, 
sulfasoxazole, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 
chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetra­
cycline (10). These agents were categorized into 9 classes 
defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
guidelines (https://clsi.org/); where available, CLSI inter­
pretive criteria were used to define resistance. Transforma­
tion studies to confirm plasmid-associated genes were con­
ducted by using plasmid purification and electroporation as 
previously described (11).
Whole-genome sequencing was performed according to 
the PulseNet protocol for the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, La 
Jolla, CA, USA) (12). Closed PacBio genomes were gener­
ated as part of a previous study and used as references where 
indicated (8). Genome assemblies for short-read data were 
generated de novo and analyzed for acquired antimicrobial 
drug–resistance determinants and plasmid replicons by using 
ResFinder and PlasmidFinder (13,14). To confirm the ab­
sence of certain genes, we performed read mapping in CLC 
Genomics Workbench version 8.5 (https://www.qiagenbio­
informatics.com/products/clc-genomics-workbench/). 
To 
identify mutational resistance, we extracted the gyrA and 
parC genes from genome assemblies by using a perl script 
(https://github.com/lskatz/lskScripts/blob/master/blastAn­
dExtract.pl). To identify mutations in the quinolone resis­
tance–determining regions of these genes, we aligned gene 
sequences in CLC Workbench. To assess isolate relatedness, 
we generated high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(hqSNP) phylogenies. In brief, isolates were aligned to the 
closed chromosomal sequence of 2014AM-3028 (omitting 
the plasmid contig) by using Lyve-SET-v1.1.4f (https://
github.com/lskatz/lyve-SET/). Genome alignments were 
processed by using Gubbins (https://sanger-pathogens.
github.io/gubbins/) to omit areas of recombination, unin­
formative sites were removed, and the resulting SNP align­
ment was used to calculate pairwise differences and gener­
ate hqSNP trees by using scripts bundled with Lyve-SET 
(15,16). We performed a phylogeographic analysis (a type 
of molecular clock analysis) by using Bayesian Evolutionary 
Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST; https://journals.plos.org/
ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003537). 
To sample more diverse Salmonella Infantis isolates, 
we obtained sequence data on isolates from sources other 
than CDC NARMS assigned to the same National Cen­
ter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SNP cluster 
PDS000003955.192 as our study isolates on the NCBI Patho­
gen Detection page (17). These additional genomes were 
from isolates recovered from hospitalized patients, meat, 
and environmental samples from Peru during 2010–2014 
and collected by the Center for Food Safety and Applied 
Nutrition at FDA and the US Naval Medical Research Unit 
(18), and isolates from chicken samples obtained at slaugh­
ter by USDA-FSIS. These isolates were used to produce a 
time-measured maximum clade credibility tree to estimate 
the dates that study isolates in addition to all isolates (study

isolates and isolates from Peru and cecal isolates from US­
DA-FSIS) shared most recent common ancestors (MRCAs), 
and the geographic location of these MRCAs (18). The date 
of the MRCA was estimated by reporting the height of the 
most ancestral node of the maximum clade credibility tree 
and the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals for 
these estimates. More details on genetic analyses are avail­
able in the online Technical Appendix (https://wwwnc.cdc.
gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0500-Techapp1.pdf).
Statistical Analyses
We used the χ2 test (or Fisher exact test when cell counts 
were ≤5) for statistical comparisons. All denominators ex­
clude persons for whom data were missing. We considered 
p<0.05 to be significant. All p values were 2-tailed. We 
used SAS 9.3 or 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to 
conduct our analyses.
Results
The first pattern 787 Salmonella Infantis isolate from a hu­
man in the United States was collected from a patient in 
June 2012. By the end of 2017, PulseNet contained 312 
Salmonella Infantis pattern 787 isolates from persons liv­
ing in 43 states; Washington, DC; and Puerto Rico. The 
number of cases detected each year increased from 5 in 
2012 to 174 in 2017 and represented 8.4% of all Salmo­
nella Infantis isolated that year (Figure 1).
State health departments submitted 34 pattern 787 
isolates from humans to CDC; 29 (85%) had resistance 
phenotypes consistent with ESBL-conferred resistance to 
ceftriaxone, ceftiofur, and ampicillin (Tables 1, 2). All 29 
isolates with ESBL-resistant phenotypes had the blaCTX-
M-65 gene. In addition to ESBL-conferred resistance, these 
isolates were also resistant to chloramphenicol, sulfisoxa­
zole, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim/sulfa­
methoxazole and intermediately susceptible to ciprofloxa­
cin and gentamicin. Resistance to these drugs was plasmid 
mediated and transferable to E. coli, except for nalidixic 
acid and ciprofloxacin, for which resistance was caused 
by a chromosomal mutation in gyrA (D87Y). Transferable 
resistance resulted from a large IncFIB-like plasmid con­
taining the resistance genes aph(3′)-Ic, aph (4)-Ia, aadA1, 
aac (3)-IVa, blaCTX-M-65, fosA, floR, sul1, tetA, and dfrA14. 
These observations are consistent with the organization of 
these genes on a single IncF1B-like plasmid closed by us­
ing long read sequencing, which was completed as part of 
a previous study by Tate et al., who recently published a 
further detailed description of this plasmid and a compara­
tive genomics analysis of blaCTX-M-65–positive IncFIB-like 
plasmids from Salmonella Infantis in the United States (9).
We focused our analysis on the 29 patients with Salmo­
nella Infantis isolates containing the blaCTX-M-65 gene (here­
after called CTX-M-65 Infantis). We compared patients 
infected with CTX-M-65 Infantis with patients infected 
with all strains of Salmonella Infantis and with patients 
infected with common Salmonella serotypes other than In­
fantis. The median age of patients with CTX-M-65 Infantis 
was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR] 15–50 years), and 
69% were female (Table 3). The median age of patients 
with any strain of Salmonella Infantis was 37 years (IQR 
12–58 years), and 56% were female. The median age of 
patients infected with other common Salmonella serotypes 
was 29 years (IQR 6–54 years), and 52% were female.
Of 18 patients infected with CTX-M-65 Infantis for 
whom outcome data were available, 8 (44%) were hospital­
ized, compared with a hospitalization rate of 29% among 
patients in both comparison groups (those with Infantis and 
those with other Salmonella serotypes; Table 3). Patients 
with CTX-M-65 Infantis infection were more likely (17%) 
to have the organism isolated from urine compared with 
all patients with Salmonella Infantis (9%, p = 0.14) and 
patients with other common serotypes (5%, p<0.01).
For 20 CTX-M-65 Infantis–infected patients with in­
formation about symptom onset date and isolation date(s), 
Salmonella Infantis was recovered from 12 who provided 
fecal samples >2 weeks after their reported date of symp­
tom onset. A total of 8 patients were still reporting symp­
toms and had positive cultures >30 days after symptom 
onset, including 3 patients who sought care and had mul­
tiple isolates recovered from 50 days to 8 months after 
symptom onset.
Twelve (63%) patients with CTX-M-65 Infantis in­
fections reported international travel in the 7 days before 
symptom onset. All reported travel to South America, 10 
to Peru, and 2 to Ecuador (Table 3). Travel was less com­
mon among all Salmonella Infantis–infected patients (7%, 
p<0.01) and those infected with other common serotypes 
(8%, p<0.01; Table 3).

CTX-M-65 Salmonella Infantis, United States
A maximum-likelihood hqSNP phylogeny of the 34 
isolates from humans and that from retail chicken meat 
revealed that isolates from patients with travel-associated 
infections formed a well-supported clade (clade A) with 
isolates from patients with infections not associated with 
travel (Figure 2). Isolates in clade A differed by only 2–47 
pairwise hqSNPs, suggesting that these isolates recently 
evolved from a common ancestor. Included in clade A was 
the isolate from retail chicken meat collected in 2014.
Of the 5 CTX-M-65-negative isolates, 2 grouped with­
in clade A and contained a multidrug-resistance plasmid 
that was lacking the blaCTX-M-65 gene. An additional 3 CTX-
M-65–negative isolates lacked the IncFIB-like plasmid 
replicon, lacked resistance determinants, and differed by

96–273 pairwise hqSNPs from isolates in clade A. Absence 
of the blaCTX-M-65 gene in these 5 isolates was confirmed by 
read-mapping procedures and supported by the observed 
phenotypic susceptibility to β-lactam antimicrobial drugs.
A phylogeographic analysis of the 32 isolates in the 
main clade and additional genomes from NCBI generated 
a time-measured phylogenetic tree of isolates from the 
United States and Peru (online Technical Appendix Figure 
1). These isolates last shared a common ancestor around 
2006 (95% HPD interval 2003–2008). This analysis also 
suggests that the MRCA of these isolates existed in Peru 
with a probability of 98.7%. The probability of the tree be­
ing rooted in the United States was ≈1.3%. Clinical iso­
lates from humans in the United States sequenced as part of 
our study last shared a common ancestor sometime around 
2009 (95% HPD interval 2008–2009), before the first isola­
tion of pattern 787 in the United States in 2012.
Discussion
A new strain of Salmonella Infantis, which has pattern 787 
and frequently carries a multidrug-resistant plasmid with a 
CTX-M-65 ESBL, has emerged in the United States. This 
strain possesses clinically important resistance associated 
with higher hospitalization rates. Using epidemiologic and 
phylogenetic methods, we demonstrated that the earliest 
cases of CTX-M-65 Infantis infection were among travelers 
returned from South America, whereas subsequent infec­
tions were acquired domestically.
The demographic and clinical characteristics among 
patients with CTX-M-65 Infantis infections differed from 
those of patients infected with all strains of Salmonella In­
fantis or other common Salmonella serotypes. CTX-M-65 
Infantis–infected patients were younger and more frequent­
ly female, and rates of hospitalization were 50% higher for 
these patients than for those in the other 2 groups. Among 
patients with CTX-M-65 Infantis infections, 63% reported 
recent travel to South America, predominantly to Peru, 
compared with <10% in the comparison groups reporting 
travel. This finding is consistent with those of other studies 
that found foreign travel to be a risk factor for CTX-M–
type ESBLs (19–21). Studies have shown that CTX-M-65 
has recently emerged in commensal E. coli in Bolivia (22) 
and in Salmonella Infantis in Ecuador (23), 2 countries to 
which patients in our study also traveled.
Our phylogeographic analysis, which included many 
isolates from Peru, suggested that isolates from patients in 
the United States last shared a common ancestor that exist­
ed in Peru in 2009. This finding makes sense, given the high 
proportion of patients in our study who reported travel to 
Peru and the known circulation of CTX-M-65–positive En­
terobacteriaceae in South America. In our study, patients 
with CTX-M-65 Infantis infection and a history of travel

CTX-M-65 Salmonella Infantis, United States
were reported every year from 2012 through 2015; patients 
with no history of travel were first reported in 2014.
One caveat is that genetic information for CTX-M In­
fantis from countries in South America other than Peru was 
not available; therefore, we could not distinguish the role 
that other countries in South America may have played in 
the spread of this Salmonella Infantis strain to the United 
States. We cannot definitively determine how patients with 
this strain of Salmonella Infantis who did not report travel 
to South America became infected; however, our analysis 
does show a close genetic relationship between clinical iso­
lates from these patients and isolates collected by USDA-
FSIS from chickens in the United States.
Poultry consumption may be a source of CTX-M-65 In­
fantis infection in the United States and abroad. In our study, 
more than one third of patients with CTX-M-65 Infantis in­
fections did not report recent international travel and thus 
were exposed via a domestic source. CTX-M genes have 
been linked to poultry, particularly broiler chickens (24–26). 
A study of 14 chicken farms in Henan Province, China, con­
ducted during 2007–2008, was the first to describe detection 
of CTX-M-65–producing E. coli in chickens (27). Recently, 
CTX-M-65 Infantis was found to be transmitted from broiler 
chickens and chicken meat to humans in Italy (28).
The results of our initial hqSNP analysis demonstrated 
that the original isolate collected from retail chicken in 
Figure 2. High-quality single-nucleotide polymorphism–based phylogenetic tree of clinical and retail meat isolates of Salmonella enterica 
serotype Infantis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern JFXX01.0787 collected in the United States and submitted to the National 
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for whole-genome sequencing. Tree tips are labeled with National Center for Biotechnology 
Information accession numbers (sequence read archive run identification numbers); shading indicates patients’ international travel history 
for clinical isolates (black, recent international travel; gray, no recent international travel; white, travel data missing). Black circles indicate 
isolates that are missing the blaCTX-M-65 gene. Isolates in top clade differed by 2–47 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Numbers 
displayed on nodes are bootstrap support values, an indication of the reliability of the tree. Only bootstrap values >80 are displayed. More 
information on patient and isolate characteristics are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.

2014 was genetically related to isolates from humans. In 
addition, our data show a clear partition between the dates 
of specimen collection from the first travel-associated in­
fections detected in the United States (2012) and the dates 
of the first domestically acquired infections detected (2014) 
(online Technical Appendix Figure 2). Sampling in poul­
try production plants and sequence data from USDA-FSIS 
demonstrate that this strain was present in domestic food 
processing plants during the latter part of the study period 
(2014–2015) (29). We cannot, however, determine pre­
cisely when or how this strain was introduced into poultry 
stock in the United States because enhanced poultry plant 
sampling was not conducted before 2014. International dis­
tribution of infected breeder stocks, chicken feed, or feed 
additives contaminated with CTX-M-65 Infantis could 
help explain how these broiler-associated infections have 
spread globally during the same period.
CTX-M-65, in comparison with more well-charac­
terized CTX-M enzymes, differs by only 2 substitutions 
(A77V, S272R) from CTX-M-14, one of the more com­
monly detected CTX-M variants worldwide (30,31). The 
blaCTX-M-65 gene was transmitted on a large IncFIB-like plas­
mid containing multiple resistance genes. The presence of 
multidrug resistance in CTX-M-65 Infantis isolates in our 
study suggests that a variety of antimicrobial drugs could 
provide positive selection pressure and thus promote per­
sistence of this strain. These characteristics suggest that the 
potential for spread of the gene is high. Research conducted 
in Bolivia has shown that even in the absence of selective 
pressure from antimicrobial drug use, plasmid transfer of 
CTX-M-65 from E. coli to other pathogens was achieved at 
high frequency and shown to be stable (22).
Additional studies on antimicrobial drug use and man­
agement practices in food animals may help us understand 
which factors contribute most to the emergence, persis­
tence, and spread of resistance genes such as blaCTX-M-65. 
New efforts to perform whole-genome sequencing on all 
Salmonella isolates at public health laboratories nationwide 
will help determine whether plasmid-mediated blaCTX-M-65 
has spread to other Salmonella serotypes. One limitation of 
our study was that we were unable to obtain epidemiologic 
data for all 312 cases. The data available from FoodNet en­
abled us to compare variables such as patient demograph­
ics, travel, and hospitalizations; however, we did not have a 
control population for evaluating other variables of interest 
to determine potential domestic sources of transmission.
The spread of CTX-M-65 is concerning because the 
presence of ESBLs eliminates 2 recommended treatment 
options, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, for the management 
of salmonellosis. Given the multidrug-resistant profile of 
CTX-M-65 Infantis, potential for plasmid-mediated trans­
mission, increased hospitalization rate, and evidence of 
this strain in domestic poultry, action is needed to prevent 
widespread dissemination in the United States. Enhanced 
surveillance and additional studies in humans and food ani­
mals may help pinpoint the sources of infection for imple­
mentation of prevention and control measures. Meanwhile, 
travelers and healthcare providers should be aware of the 
risks and implications of infection with this strain, includ­
ing the potential for antimicrobial treatment failure.

The effectiveness of oral HIV preexposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP) strongly depends on maintaining adherence. We 
investigated the association between substance use and 
PrEP adherence, as well as incident sexually transmitted in­
fections (STIs) in a high-risk cohort of 394 participants (391 
men who have sex with men and 3 transgender women) who 
were enrolled in a PrEP demonstration project. We assessed 
baseline and ongoing substance use over a 48-week period 
for stimulants and nonstimulant substances and for each 
substance separately. We measured PrEP adherence by 
using dried blood spots to obtain levels of tenofovir diphos­
phate. No differences in these levels were found between 
substance users and nonsubstance users. Baseline stimu­
lant use was strongly associated (odds ratio 3.4; p<0.001) 
with incident STIs during the study. Thus, PrEP adherence 
was not decreased by substance use. Because substance 
users had increased rates of STIs, indicating higher-risk be­
havior, they might be excellent candidates for PrEP.
O
ver the past 2 decades, substance use, in particular 
use of stimulants, such as methamphetamine, remains 
prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) and 
transgender women in the United States (1). Alcohol, stim­
ulant use, and injection drug use (IDU) are independently 
associated with increased risk behavior and HIV acquisi­
tion among MSM and transgender women (1–4). Thus, 
HIV-uninfected MSM and transgender women with sub­
stance use might represent ideal candidates for preexposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP).
The efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 
combined with emtricitibine (FTC) for HIV PrEP has been 
documented in several randomized and controlled trials (5–
7). In the iPrEx study, TDF/FTC reduced the risk for HIV 
infection in MSM by 44% vs. placebo, and a 73% lower 
risk of HIV infection was reported for persons who had 
>90% self-reported adherence (5), and >90% lower risk for 
persons who had adherence defined by tenofovir diphos­
phate (TFV-DP) drug levels commensurate with >4 tablets 
per week (8).
The Bangkok TDF Study randomized 2,413 persons 
who injected drugs (PWIDs; <5% were MSM) 1:1 to TDF 
or placebo, and results showed a 48% reduction in HIV 
seroconverison in the treatment arm (9,10). However, in 
that study, study participants had daily observed dosing in 
conjunction with substance use disorder treatment. There­
fore, adherence remains uncertain among substance users 
without observed therapy.
The effectiveness of TDF/FTC for HIV PrEP strongly 
depends on maintaining adherence (11,12). Although stud­
ies have indicated that different strategies might be required 
for PrEP implementation for MSM who use stimulant sub­
stances and alcohol (13), comprehensive/demonstrative 
studies that evaluate adherence among MSM or transgender 
women using different classes of substances are lacking.
We hypothesized that, among MSM and transgender 
women enrolled in a randomized controlled PrEP demon­
stration trial, substance users would have lower levels of 
PrEP adherence. The objective of our study was to inves­
tigate the association between substance/alcohol use and 
adherence to PrEP, as well as sexually transmitted infec­
tions (STIs) and study completion, in a well-characterized 
high-risk cohort of MSM and transgender women who par­
ticipated in the California Collaborative Treatment Group 
(CCTG) 595 Study.
Materials and Methods
CCTG 595 was a randomized controlled trial of individu­
alized text messaging versus standard care for adherence 
to daily TDF/FTC PrEP (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/
show/NCT01761643) (14). In CCTG 595, PrEP was given 
in combination with safety monitoring, HIV/STI testing, 
and risk reduction counseling. On a daily basis, participants 
in the intervention arm received a mixture of health pro­
motion and factoid messages at a personally selected time 
consistent with when they planned to take PrEP. The study 
was conducted during February 2014–February 2016. Pa­
tients were enrolled at 4 medical centers in southern Cali­
fornia (University of California San Diego, University of 
Southern California, Harbor–University of California Los 
Angeles, and Long Beach Health Department), and partici­
pants were provided with mobile phones in case they did 
not have a mobile phone (14).
Eligible participants for CCTG 595 were HIV-unin­
fected MSM and transgender women (age >18 years) con­
firmed by a negative result for an antigen/antibody assay 
or antibody assay plus HIV nucleic acid amplification test. 
Participants needed to have a persistent increased risk for 
HIV acquisition as determined by >1 of the following cri­
teria: 1) >1 HIV-infected sexual partner for >4 weeks; 2) 
condomless anal intercourse with >3 male sex partners who 
were HIV positive or of unknown HIV status during the 
previous 3 months; or 3) condomless anal sex with >1 male 
partner and an STI diagnosis during the previous 3 months. 
Participants were required to have acceptable laboratory 
test values during the previous 30 days; exclusion criteria

included active hepatitis B. Study visits occurred at base­
line and at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 for the primary out­
come. Study participants were allowed to continue receiv­
ing the study drug past week 48 until the last participant 
completed his or her week 48 visit.
At each visit, we collected data by using a confiden­
tial in-person interview and computer-assisted survey self-
report (e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ9]). We 
found no significant differences in the primary adherence 
outcome between the 2 study arms (72.0% in text messag­
ing arm vs. 69.2% in standard of care; p = 0.58), in adequate 
adherence at week 12 (91.7% vs. 85.6%; p = 0.07) or week 
48 (83.4% vs. 81.6%; p = 0.77), or in baseline substance 
use (p = 0.11) or Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST10) 
result (p = 0.30) (14).
For this analysis, we included randomized CCTG 595 
participants who had completed the baseline substance use 
questionnaire (n = 394) to examine associations with sub­
stance use over 48 weeks and used dried blood spot (DBS) 
intracellular TFV-DP levels as a biologic measure of PrEP 
adherence (15). We assessed substance use during the pre­
vious 3 months at baseline and week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 
visits by using a Substance Use Screening Questionnaire 
(SCID). Each substance variable was categorized into no 
use, some use (1–4 times), and frequent use (>5 times) 
on the basis of the frequency of use during the previous 
3 months. We also analyzed use of combined stimulant 
substances (i.e., poppers, methamphetamine, cocaine, ec­
stasy, amphetamine, and other stimulants); nonstimulant 
substances (i.e., heroin, other opioids [e.g., hydrocodone 
bitartrate/acetaminophen and oxycontin], sedatives, anti­
anxiety drugs, hallucinogens, dissociative drugs, and inhal­
ants); and any substances (i.e., stimulant and nonstimulant 
substances listed previously, not including alcohol and 
marijuana use).
We assessed problematic use at baseline by using the 
DAST10 and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test 
(AUDIT). DAST10 score was grouped into 3 categories: no 
or low problems, DAST10 score <3; moderate problems, 
DAST10 score >3–<6; and substantial or severe problems, 
DAST10 score >6. AUDIT score was grouped into 3 cat­
egories: <8, >8–<16, and >16. Ongoing substance use was 
defined as >50% of completed study visits (study had 6 
regular visits) with reported use in the SCID. Ongoing sub­
stance use was defined in a hierarchical way. We first de­
fined frequent ongoing user as reporting frequent substance 
use on the SCID at >50% of visits; if this criterion was not 
reached, we looked further at whether the study participant 
reported any substance use (including some and frequent) 
at >50% of visits; if yes, we defined them as some ongoing 
user; otherwise, they were counted as not an ongoing user.
We determined adherence by measuring intracellular 
TFV-DP levels in DBS. A TFV-DP concentration >719 
fmoL/punch of a paper disk containing DBS (e.g., https://
www.analytical-sales.com/DBS.html) was defined as an 
average of >4 tablets/week. This value is the unrounded 
level corresponding to 700 fmoL/punch level used in the 
IPREX OLE study, which reported 0 of 28 seroconver­
sions when the TFV-DP level was >700 fmoL/punch (16). 
We determined intracellular TFV-DP concentrations at the 
week 12 visit and the last on-drug visit on or before the 
week 48 visit by using a validated method (15).
The primary DBS adherence outcome was a composite 
outcome for being adherent as defined by a DBS TFV-DP 
level >719 fmoL/punch (i.e., adequate adherence) at the 
week 12 visit and, if continued past week 12, the last study 
visit through week 48 (e.g., week 24, 36, or 48). Missing or 
not completing the visit at week 12 was considered nonad­
herence. If week 12 was the last study visit while receiving 
drug, then the adherence of the participant was based only 
on that 1 value. The secondary DBS near-perfect adherence 
composite outcome included the same composite outcome 
for DBS TFV-DP dose associated with taking 7 doses of 
TDF in the past week (>1,246 fmoL/punch) (15,16). In ad­
dition to the composite outcomes, we also performed cross-
sectional analyses at weeks 12 and 48 on the basis of avail­
able samples.
As a secondary objective, we assessed whether sub­
stance or alcohol use reported at baseline impacted study 
completion and incident STIs during the study (i.e., mea­
sure of sexual risk behavior). STI screening assessments 
at baseline and every 3 months over 12 months included 
syphilis (serum rapid plasma reagin, and if a positive result 
was obtained, a confirmatory treponemal test), nucleic acid 
amplification test of urine, and testing of pharyngeal and 
rectal swab specimens for Chlamydia spp. and gonorrhea 
(Aptima; Hologic, Marlborough, MA, USA). Information 
about newly diagnosed STIs was communicated to partici­
pants, and referrals were made to their providers or a local 
STI clinic for treatment. Incident STI was defined as having 
positive results for gonorrhea or infection with Chlamydia 
spp. at any site or a positive rapid plasma reagin result for 
syphilis during the study visits after baseline.
We compared baseline characteristics, DBS adherence 
composites, and incident STI during the study and at study 
completion regarding substance/alcohol use categories by 
using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and 
analysis of variance test. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test to test continuous variables. To assess the association 
between substance/alcohol use and outcomes (i.e., adher­
ence, study completion, and incident), we used separate 
logistic regression models adjusted for study arm and other 
baseline factors that were associated with outcome. We as­
sessed model discrimination by using the goodness-of-fit 
Hosmer–Lemeshow statistic. In addition, we used Cox re­
gression models to study the association between baseline

substance use and time to early study termination or time 
to first incident STI diagnosis and reported hazard ratios 
(HRs). We defined time to study termination as the last 
completed visit of a participant. Participants who did not 
leave the study early were censored at week 48. Participants 
who did not reach the event were censored at their last visit 
before or at week 48. A p value <0.05 was considered sta­
tistically significant. No adjustment was made for multiple 
comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed by using 
R software version 3.3.2 (http://cran.r-project.org).
Results
A total of 394 persons participated in the study and com­
pleted their baseline substance use questionnaire (Figure 1). 
Of these participants, any substance use was reported by 288 
(73%) and any alcohol use by 327 (83%). Overall, substance 
use remained relatively stable over the course of the study 
(e.g., 39% reported frequent substance use at baseline and 
42% at week 48). Some ongoing substance use was reported 
by 37%, and frequent ongoing substance was reported by 
38%. Participants with ongoing substance use had higher 
levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ9 scores) than those 
without ongoing substance use. We obtained demographic 
data and PHQ9 and DAST10 scores of subgroups with no, 
some, and frequent ongoing substance use (Table 1).
Overall, 89% of participants at week 12 and 83% of 
participants at week 48 had adequate DBS TFV-DP levels 
(i.e., >719 fmoL/punch); 48% of participants at week 12 
and 44% of participants at week 48 had estimated near-
perfect DBS TFV-DP levels (i.e., >1,246 fmoL/punch). 
A total of 279/394 (71%) study participants reached the 
primary DBS adherence composite (i.e., adequate adher­
ence), 115/394 (29%) reached the secondary DBS adher­
ence composite (i.e., near-perfect adherence), and 322/394 
(82%) completed the study (i.e., the week 48 visit) (14).
Univariate analyses showed no significant difference 
in the primary or secondary DBS adherence outcomes be­
tween persons with or without ongoing substance/alcohol 
use (all p values >0.2; Table 2). There was also no signifi­
cant association between baseline substance/alcohol use or 
between baseline DAST10 and AUDIT scores and adher­
ence outcomes (all p values >0.5; Table 2). Similar results 
were confirmed in multivariable logistic regression models 
adjusted for study arm, race, and baseline PHQ9 scores (all 
p values >0.1).
We created boxplots of DBS TFV-DP levels at weeks 
12 and 48 for those with no, some, and frequent ongo­
ing substance use (alcohol and marijuana excluded), as 
well as boxplots of DBS TFV-DP levels at week 48 by 
AUDIT and DAST10 score categories (Figure 2). We 
also developed cross-sectional associations of previous 
3 months substance use with adequate and perfect ad­
herence at weeks 12 and 48 (online Technical Appendix 
Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-
0400-Techapp1.pdf). Although at week 48 persons with 
the highest category of AUDIT scores were significantly 
less likely to have adequate adherence (p = 0.03), persons 
who had substantial or severe substance use problems 
according to DAST10 were significantly more likely to 
reach near-perfect adherence (p = 0.04). However, when 
we compared DBS TFV-DP as a continuous variable be­
tween the AUDIT and DAST10 groups, differences were 
not significant (p = 0.847 for AUDIT and p = 0.099 for 
DAST10; Figure 2).
Overall, 322/394 (82%) participants completed the 
study (Table 3). In the Cox regression model adjusting 
for study arm (Table 4), we found that frequent base­
line substance use was significantly associated with 
study completion (HR for early study termination 0.541; 
p = 0.036) compared with persons who had no substance

use; 86% of persons who had frequent substance use com­
pleted the study compared with 81% who had some sub­
stance use and 76% who had no substance use). We also cal­
culated the same model after replacing substance use with 
alcohol use and methamphetamine use. Although baseline 
alcohol use was not a strong predictor of study completion, 
we found that some methamphetamine use at baseline was 
associated with a significantly lower likelihood of study 
completion compared with no methamphetamine use, but 
frequent methamphetamine use at baseline was not associ­
ated with study completion (HR for early study termina­
tion for some methamphetamine use 1.885; p = 0.046; 70% 
study completion for some methamphetamine use vs. 83% 
study completion for no or frequent methamphetamine 
use). The logistic regression models yielded similar find­
ings (online Technical Appendix Table 2).
In an explorative analysis, we focused on 39 (9.9%) 
persons who left the study early (before the week 24 vis­
it). We found that persons who had some baseline meth­
amphetamine use had a greater tendency to leave the 
study early (17.5% left the study early vs. 4.3% who had 
frequent methamphetamine use and 9.3% who had no 
methamphetamine use), but frequent baseline substance 
use tended to be associated with a lower tendency to leave 
the study early (5.2%; all p>0.05). 
Overall, 152 (39%) of 394 participants were given 
a diagnosis of an incident STI during the study. By us­
ing univariate analysis (Table 3), we found that incident 
STIs occurred more frequently in participants with some 
and frequent stimulant use at baseline (incident STIs oc­
curred in 48% of both groups vs. 21% in persons with 
no stimulant use at baseline; p<0.001). This difference 
was driven by use of poppers (52% incident STIs in per­
sons with frequent popper use and 50% in persons with 
some popper use vs. 26% in persons with no popper use; 
p<0.001). We also found significantly higher rates of in­
cident STIs in those with some methamphetamine use 
(58% STI incidence vs. 36% in persons with no metham­
phetamine use and 39% in persons with frequent meth­
amphetamine use; p = 0.037). No difference was found 
for alcohol use.
By using Cox regression models adjusting for 
study arm, age, and baseline STI status, we found that 
stimulant use was strongly associated with incident STI

Substance Use and Adherence to HIV Prophylaxis
during the study (HR 2.7 for some use, 2.6 for frequent 
use; both p<0.001) (Table 4). We also obtained signifi­
cant results when stimulant use was replaced with pop­
per use (HR 2.3 for some use, 2.5 for frequent use; both 
p<0.001) or any substance use (HR 2.1 for some use, 
p = 0.002; HR 2.0 for frequent use, p = 0.004). When 
we replaced stimulant use with methamphetamine use, 
some methamphetamine use was a significant predictor 
of incident STI (HR 1.9, p = 0.005), but frequent use was 
not a significant predictor. In contrast, alcohol use was 
not a strong predictor of incident STI. Logistic regres­
sion models yielded similar findings (online Technical 
Appendix Table 2).
Discussion
We investigated the association between substance/alco­
hol use and adherence to PrEP, as well as study comple­
tion and incident STIs, in a high-risk cohort of mostly 
MSM who participated in a randomized controlled PrEP 
adherence trial. Three main findings are evident. First, 
substance use was not associated with decreased adher­
ence to PrEP, as measured by TFV-DP in DBS. Second, 
baseline frequent substance use was associated with high­
er likelihood of study completion. Third, baseline stimu­
lant use was strongly associated with higher rates of inci­
dent STIs during the study, suggesting greater sexual risk 
behavior in users of stimulant substances. Taken together,

these findings indicate that substance use should not be 
used as a reason to withhold PrEP because of concerns 
about adherence.
We and others have shown that substance use in 
general, and methamphetamine and other stimulant use 
in particular, is a likely cause of increased sexual risk 
behavior among MSM and therefore a predictor for HIV 
acquisition (3,17–21). Thus, HIV-uninfected MSM who 
use substances should be considered a target popula­
tion for PrEP. However, substance-using MSM often 
face major individual barriers (e.g., HIV-related stigma, 
substance use) and structural barriers (e.g., economic, 
healthcare) that might reduce linkage and adherence to 
PrEP (13,22–26).
Adherence is probably the major factor affecting PrEP 
effectiveness in those linked to PrEP, as outlined by a 
recently published mathematical model, which showed that 
increased adherence was the only factor resulting in reduc­
tions of the number needed to treat with PrEP to prevent 1 
HIV infection (27). Our study indicates that substance use

Substance Use and Adherence to HIV Prophylaxis
was not associated with decreased adherence to PrEP. No­
tably, in this study, persons who used methamphetamines 
did not have worse adherence than persons who did not use 
methamphetamines. A previous qualitative study indicated 
that barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence differ by type 
of substance used. In that study, stimulant drug users were 
more likely to be concerned that substance use would affect 
PrEP adherence, and were less concerned about HIV stig­
ma as a barrier to PrEP uptake compared with alcohol users 
(13). However, in our study, we did not find an association 
between stimulant use and PrEP adherence.
Baseline frequent substance use was associated with 
higher likelihood of study completion, and no associations 
were found for alcohol use. Some methamphetamine use 
was associated with lower likelihood of study completion 
when compared with frequent or no methamphetamine 
use. Although some methamphetamine use might relate 
to MSM who use methamphetamines occasionally, in 
intermittent binges that are more likely to impart risk for 
loss to care, the reasons for the increased study dropout of 
these persons remains unknown.
Some or frequent stimulant use at baseline was strongly 
associated with contracting an incident STI during the study. 
This finding was driven mainly by popper use. We also found 
higher rates of incident STIs for persons with some metham­
phetamine use when compared with persons who had fre­
quent or no methamphetamine use. One speculative explana­
tion for this association is that many MSM take psychoactive 
drugs, in particular methamphetamine, and engage in sex at 
the same time. Also known as chemsex or party and play, 
this practice is associated with condomless anal sex, multiple 
sex partners, and the transmission of HIV and other STIs 
(4,28,29). This intermittent methamphetamine use might not 
occur frequently (i.e., not fullfilling frequent methamphet­
amine use in an SCID questionnaire) but might be associated 
with high-risk sexual activities. Together with the finding 
that those with some methamphetamine use also have lower 
study completion rates, this finding might warrant further

investigations into tailored HIV prevention counseling, as 
well as retention counseling, for this group of persons.
As a secondary finding, we found that substantial or 
severe problems with alcohol use, according to the AU­
DIT questionnaire at week 48, were associated with lower 
likelihood of adequate adherence in cross-sectional analy­
sis, although we found no strong association when DBS 
TFV-DP levels were used as a continuous outcome. Also, 
we found no strong associations between baseline AUDIT 
scores and adherence composites.
Limitations of our study include that DBS TFV-DP 
levels were only measured at 2 time points, and that the 
composite adherence outcome logistic regression models 
did not account for missing follow-up data and time effects. 
In addition, we assessed frequency of substance use with 
validated SCID questionnaires that use categories (with 
the highest category being >5 times) instead of assessing 
frequency as a continuous outcome. This limitation is ap­
plicable particularly to the assessment of alcohol use, in 
which the frequent use category (i.e., >5 times within 3 
months) might not seem appropriate. However, although 
our study did not look specifically into the effect of more 
frequent substance and alcohol use (e.g., >10 or >20 times 
in the previous 3 months), the study included AUDIT and 
DAST scores that have been accepted as measures of prob­
lematic alcohol and substance use.
Another limitation was that IDU was not assessed 
separately. However, when we analyzed heroin use as 
a proxy for IDU, we found no negative associations be­
tween heroin use and adherence, although these analyses 
were limited by small sample size. A recent dynamic com­
partmental cost model suggested oral PrEP for PWIDs as 
a potentially cost-effective strategy to control HIV in re­
gions where IDU is a major driver of the substance use 
epidemic (30). Future studies are needed to evaluate PrEP 
adherence in PWIDs. Finally, there is a chance that drug 
interactions could increase TFV-DP concentrations in 
substance abusers, resulting in misclassification of sub­
stance users as adherent, but no evidence supports this 
hypothesis. In our study, drug interaction seems unlikely, 
given the consistency of findings across different drugs 
of abuse, including alcohol, that have different pharma­
cologic profiles.
In conclusion, for MSM who participated in a random­
ized controlled trial, we found that baseline substance us­
ers had increased STI rates, indicating higher risk behavior, 
but PrEP adherence was not decreased by substance use. 
Our findings suggest that substance-using persons are ap­
propriately diligent with PrEP adherence and therefore are 
excellent candidates for PrEP.

We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the evo­
lutionary context of an emerging highly pathogenic strain 
of Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 
in England and Wales. A timed phylogeny of sublineage 
IIb revealed that the emerging clone evolved from a STEC 
O157:H7 stx-negative ancestor ≈10 years ago after acquisi­
tion of a bacteriophage encoding Shiga toxin (stx) 2a, which 
in turn had evolved from a stx2c progenitor ≈20 years ago. 
Infection with the stx2a clone was a significant risk factor 
for bloody diarrhea (OR 4.61, 95% CI 2.24–9.48; p<0.001), 
compared with infection with other strains within sublineage 
IIb. Clinical symptoms of cases infected with sublineage IIb 
stx2c and stx-negative clones were comparable, despite the 
loss of stx2c. Our analysis highlighted the highly dynamic 
nature of STEC O157:H7 Stx-encoding bacteriophages and 
revealed the evolutionary history of a highly pathogenic 
clone emerging within sublineage IIb, a sublineage not pre­
viously associated with severe clinical symptoms.
S
higa 
toxin–producing 
Escherichia 
coli 
(STEC) 
O157:H7 cause a wide range of gastrointestinal symp­
toms, including mild gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, vom­
iting, and bloody diarrhea (1). A subset of patients, most 
commonly the very old and the very young, go on to devel­
op hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (2). STEC O157:H7 
are zoonotic, and transmission to humans is most common­
ly associated with ruminants, especially cattle and sheep. 
Transmission occurs by consumption of contaminated food 
or water or by direct contact with animals or their environ­
ment. The infectious dose is low (10–100 organisms), and 
person-to-person spread can occur in households, nurseries, 
and other institutional settings (1). The STEC pathotype is 
defined by the presence of the genes encoding Shiga toxin 
(Stx) type 1, type 2, or both, located on a bacteriophage 
incorporated into the bacterial genome (3). Stx1 and Stx2 
can be further divided into subtypes Stx1a–1d and Stx2a–
2g; Stx2a is strongly associated with causing severe disease 
(4,5). The STEC O157:H7 population has previously been 
delineated into 3 main lineages (I, I/II, and II) (6), and 7 
sublineages (Ia, Ib, Ic, IIa, IIb, IIc, and I/ll) (5).
In England, the most common STEC serotype is 
O157:H7, which causes an average of 800 cases/year (1). 
All STEC O157:H7 isolated at local hospital laborato­
ries from fecal samples from hospitalized patients and all 
cases in the community are submitted to the Gastrointes­
tinal Bacteria Reference Unit (GBRU) at Public Health 
England for confirmation of identification and typing. 
From 2000 through 2016, phage type (PT) 8 with the stx 
profile stx1a/stx2c and PT21/28 with the stx profile stx2a 
or stx2a/stx2c were detected most frequently in England, 
with PT21/28 the most frequently associated with severe 
disease (2,7).
Since 2015, all isolates submitted to GBRU have 
been genome sequenced. Whole-genome sequencing 
(WGS) demonstrates unparalleled sensitivity and accu­
racy in identifying linked cases (8). Using WGS data dur­
ing outbreak investigations has improved the robustness 
of case ascertainment and provided forensic evidence 
for linking human cases to the source of their infection 
(9,10). Phylogenetic inference can also reveal how strains 
are related over time and space more accurately than other 
molecular typing methods and may provide insight into 
the evolutionary and epidemiologic context of emerging 
pathogenic clones (8,10,11).
In 2015, a total of 47 persons were affected by an 
outbreak in England of foodborne gastrointestinal illness 
caused by STEC O157:H7 PT8 stx2a. The outbreak was as­
sociated with the consumption of contaminated prepacked 
salad leaves (11). The outbreak strain continued to cause 
sporadic infection and outbreaks of foodborne disease 
throughout 2016 and 2017 (11). The aim of our analysis 
was to investigate the evolutionary history of this newly 
emergent strain of STEC O157:H7 PT8 stx2a and assess 
the risk to public health.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains
All isolates submitted to GBRU for confirmation and typ­
ing from local hospital laboratories in England and Wales 
during July 2015–December 2017 were sequenced for rou­
tine surveillance (National Center for Biotechnology In­
formation Short Read Archive bioproject PRJNA248042). 
We included an additional 74 clinical isolates of STEC 
O157:H7 belonging to sublineage IIb, the lineage con­
taining STEC O157:H7 PT8 stx2a, that were submitted to 
GBRU between January 2010–June 2015 from previous 
studies (5,8) (online Technical Appendix Table, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0409-Techapp1.
pdf). We selected these STEC O157:H7 isolates on the 
basis of stx subtype and phage type diversity to provide 
context as a sample of the background population. We 
defined STEC O157:H7 isolates from patients who were 
hospitalized as a result of their gastrointestinal symptoms 
or who reported bloody diarrhea as highly pathogenic or 
as having increased pathogenic potential compared with 
isolates from patients who were asymptomatic or reporting 
nonbloody diarrhea.
Genome Sequence Analysis
For WGS, we extracted DNA from cultures of STEC 
O157:H7 for sequencing on the HiSeq 2500 instrument (Il­
lumina, San Diego, California, USA). We mapped qual­
ity trimmed Illumina reads (12) to the STEC O157:H7 
reference genome Sakai (GenBank accession no. BA000007) 
using Burrows Wheeler Aligner-Maximum Exact Matching 
(BWA-MEM) (13). We identified single- nucleotide poly­
morphisms (SNPs) using Genome Analysis Toolkit version 
2 (14) in unified genotyper mode and extracted core genome 
positions that had a high-quality SNP (>90% consensus, mini­
mum depth ×10, GQ >30) in >1 isolate for further analysis. 
We performed hierarchical single linkage clustering on the 
pairwise SNP difference between all strains at various dis­
tance thresholds (250, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 0). The result of the 
clustering is a SNP profile, or SNP address, that can be used 
to describe population structure based on clonal groups (15). 
We performed recombination analysis using Gub­
bins (16) and reconstructed timed phylogenies using 
BEAST-MCMC version 2.4.7 (17). We computed alter­
native clock models and population priors and assessed 
their suitability on the basis of Bayes factor tests. The 
highest supported model was a relaxed log-normal clock 
rate with a Bayesian skyline population model. We ran 
all models with a chain length of 1 billion. We recon­
structed a maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAn­
notator version 1.75 (17).
We performed Stx subtyping as described by Ashton 
et al. (18). The integration of Stx-encoding prophage into 
the host genome has been characterized into 6 target genes: 
wrbA, encoding a NAD quinone oxidoreductase; yehV, a 
transcriptional regulator; sbcB, an exonuclease; yecE, a gene 
of unknown function; the tRNA gene argW; and Z2577, 
which encodes an oxidoreductase (5). We mapped short

from England and Wales during June 1, 2010–December 31, 2017.

reads from the STEC O157:H7 genomes to intact refer­
ence sequences of these genes, and aligned them with BWA 
MEM (13). We defined occupied Stx bacteriophage inser­
tion (SBI) sites as those strains that had disrupted alignments 
(5). We used Tablet to visualize read pileups (19).
Data Analyses
The National Enhanced Surveillance System for STEC 
(NESSS) in England was implemented on January 1, 2009, 
and has been described in detail elsewhere (1). For this study, 
we extracted data from NESSS for the cases identified as be­
ing infected with strains that had been sequenced and belong­
ing to the sublineage IIb cluster of interest (containing the 
STEC O157:H7 PT8 stx2a, outbreak strain). We excluded 
asymptomatic carriers detected through screening high-risk 
contacts of symptomatic patients as well as patients who did 
not return the enhanced surveillance questionnaire (ESQ) to 
NESSS. Data analyzed included age, gender, and whether 
the patient reported symptoms of nonbloody diarrhea, bloody 
diarrhea, and vomiting along with whether cases were hos­
pitalized, developed typical HUS, or died. Cases were cat­
egorized into children (<16 years of age) or adults, based 
on a priori knowledge that children are most at risk for both 
STEC infection and progression to HUS (1). Where clinical 
symptoms were blank on the ESQ, we coded them as nega­
tive responses for these symptoms. We divided cases into 3 
groups based on stx subtype: stx2a, stx2c, and stx-negative.
We first described patients’ symptoms by stx subtype 
as well as by age group and sex and also examined the dis­
tribution of stx subtype by age and gender. We used Fisher 
exact tests to compare proportions among different groups. 
We assessed reporting of bloody diarrhea or hospitalization 
as a marker of disease severity by stx subtype. We used 
logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) to assess 
bloody diarrhea by stx subtype while adjusting for age 
(child/adult) and sex. We performed all analyses in Stata 
13.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, US).
Results
Sublineage IIb
The STEC O157:H7 stx2a clone analyzed in this study was 
located within sublineage IIb, and belonged to a 250 SNP 
single-linkage cluster, designated 18%. This cluster com­
prised 251 clinical isolates: 138 of STEC O157:H7 stx2a, 77 
of stx-negative E. coli O157:H7, and 36 of STEC O157:H7 
stx2c (Figure 1; online Technical Appendix Table). Since 
July 2015, when Public Health England implemented the 
use of WGS for STEC, the number of cases identified with­
in sublineage IIb has remained stable (≈60/y). However, 
the number of cases of the stx-negative E. coli O157:H7 
clone has declined, whereas the stx2a and stx2c clones are 
increasing (Figure 1).
Evolutionary Timescale and Stx Prophage Insertion in 
STEC O157:H7
We reconstructed a timed phylogeny of sublineage IIb 
(Figure 2). We calculated the mutation rate of STEC 
O157:H7 within sublineage IIb to be ≈2 mutations per 
genome per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD] 
1.7–2.4). This rate is less than the 2.6 mutations per ge­
nome per year previously calculated across the complete 
STEC O157 population (5). Our analysis revealed that the 
emerging stx2a clone evolved from a stx-negative recent 
ancestor with the acquisition of stx2a ≈10 years ago (95% 
HPD 9.0 years  12.7 years). Previously, this stx-negative 
clone had evolved from a stx2c progenitor ≈20 years ago 
(95% HPD 17.6 years–24.6 years) after the loss of stx2c.
Figure 2. Timed phylogeny of Shiga toxin–producing 
Escherichia coli O157:H7 sublineage IIb isolates illustrating 
the sequential loss of stx2c and subsequent gain of stx2a. Red 
indicates stx2a; green, stx negative; blue, stx2c. Scale bar 
indicates years in the past.
Historically, the majority of strains in sublineage IIb har­
bored a Stx2c-encoding prophage at sbcB, with the yehV SBI 
site occupied by a truncated non–Stx-encoding prophage (5). 
Analysis of the short read data indicated that in the stx-nega­
tive sublineage IIb clone, yehV was disrupted but sbcB was in­
tact, indicating the loss of the Stx2c-encoding prophage from 
the SBI site. The more recently emerged sublineage IIb stx2a 
clone had disrupted SBI sites at sbcB and yehV only, indicat­
ing that a Stx2a-encoding phage had been inserted into sbcB, 
the site left vacant in the stx-negative clone after the loss 
of stx2c.
Disease Severity of Clinical Cases within 
the Sublineage IIb Cluster by stx Subtype
Overall, 91.6% patients (230/251, 95% CI 88.1–95.1) had 
symptoms of diarrhea, and similar percentages were re­
ported regardless of the stx subtype profile of the STEC 
O157:H7 causing the infection (Table 1). Rates of other 
symptoms varied; 28.3% of patients (71/251, 95% CI 22.7–
33.9) reported vomiting, 35.1% (88/251, 95% CI: 29.1–41.0) 
experienced bloody diarrhea, and 18.7% (47/251, 95% CI: 
13.9–23.5) were hospitalized. Hospitalization occurred more 
often for patients reporting bloody diarrhea (35.2% [31/88, 
95% CI 25.0–45.4]) than those without bloody diarrhea 
(9.8% [16/163], 95% CI 5.2–14.1; p<0.001). Half (50.0%) 
of patients infected with stx2a isolates reported bloody di­
arrhea (69/138, 95% CI 41.5–58.4), compared with 15.6% 
of patients infected with stx-negative isolates (12/77, 95% 
CI 7.3–23.9) and 19.4% of those infected with stx2c isolates 
(7/36, 95% CI 5.9–33.0; p<0.001). No patients were known 
to experience HUS, and none died.
Among the 251 clinical cases, 141 (56.2%, 95% CI 
50.0%–62.3%) were adults and 136 (54.2%, 95% CI 
48.0%–60.4%) were female. Adult patients were infected 
with stx2a strains (61.0% [86/141], 95% CI 52.8%–69.1%) 
more often than children (47.3% [52/110], 95% CI 37.8%–
56.7%; p = 0.030). Conversely, children were more often in­
fected with stx-negative strains than adults: 41.8% (46/110) 
of children (95% CI 32.4%–51.2%) versus 22.0% (31/141) 
of adults (95% CI 15.1%–28.9%; p = 0.001). There was 
also variation in stx subtype by sex; proportionately more 
female patients were infected with stx2a strains (61.0%

Highly Pathogenic Clone of STEC O157
male patients (28.7% [33/115], 95% CI 20.3%–37.1%), al­
though the difference was not statistically significant (p = 
0.05). The proportion of patients hospitalized did not differ 
significantly by sex or age group (data not shown).
After adjusting for age (adult or child) and sex, the 
odds ratio of experiencing bloody diarrhea was significant­
ly higher in those infected with the stx2a clone compared 
with patients infected with the stx-negative clone (Table 2). 
The odds of bloody diarrhea were no different for cases in­
fected with the stx2c clone than for the stx-negative clone. 
Among the cases analyzed, being a child was protective for 
symptoms of bloody diarrhea.
Discussion
The data described here support previous studies that 
showed the acquisition and loss of the Stx-encoding phage 
is highly dynamic in STEC O157:H7 (5,20). Most com­
monly described is the acquisition of stx1a or stx2a by a 
STEC O157:H7 stx2c progenitor, followed by the subse­
quent loss of stx2c in strains that acquired stx2a. The in­
volvement of a stx-negative intermediate in this process, as 
captured here, has not been previously described. The loss 
of the Stx2c-encoding phage appears to have facilitated the 
acquisition of the Stx2a-encoding phage because the latter 
was inserted into the same SBI site, sbcB, left vacant by the 
Stx2c-encoding phage.
Using phylogenetic analysis of variation at the whole-
genome level, we reconstructed the recent evolutionary 
history of this emerging pathogenic clone within STEC 
O157:H7 sublineage IIb. We observed the loss of stx2c 
from the stx2c progenitor that caused a stx-negative clone 
≈20 years ago, followed by the acquisition of stx2a ≈10 
years ago, and later expansion as shown in Figure 1. Previ­
ously, we showed that the historic acquisition of a Stx2a-
encoding bacteriophage by a population of STEC O157:H7 
PT2 stx2c, belonging to lineage I/II indigenous in the UK 
cattle population, was associated with the first outbreaks of 
childhood HUS in England in the early 1980s (5,7). Sub­
sequently, the increase in the incidence of STEC O157:H7 
PT21/28 during the 1990s was linked to the acquisition of 
stx2a by an indigenous population of STEC O157:H7 stx2c 
belonging to sublineage Ic, resulting in the highly pathogen­
ic contemporary clone STEC PT21/28 stx2a/stx2c (1,2,5,7). 
This clone has been associated with several outbreaks in 
the United Kingdom associated with a high incidence of 
HUS (10,21–23). Here, we described an E.coli O157:H7 
clone from yet another UK domestic lineage (sublineage 
IIb) that has recently acquired the Stx2a-encoding phage 
and is showing evidence of increasing pathogenic potential.
The analysis of disease severity of clinical cases by 
stx subtype of isolates of STEC O157:H7 within the same 
sublineage IIb cluster showed a significant association 
between the presence of stx2a and markers of disease 
severity; specifically, bloody diarrhea linked to higher rates 
of hospitalization. Previous studies have reported evidence 
of increased pathogenicity of STEC harboring stx2a (4,5). 
However, these studies report on STEC from a wide range 
of different serotypes, exhibiting a wide variety of stx sub­
types and are based on relatively small datasets. In this 
study, we present the analysis of a large dataset focusing 
on a specific clade within a single serotype characterized by 
a limited number of stx subtype combinations, specifically 
stx2c, stx negative, and stx2a only. This analysis enabled 
us to make direct comparisons between specific stx profiles 
while limiting the influence of other factors in the genome.
Strains of Stx-negative E. coli O157:H7 are regarded 
as atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), defined by the 
presence of the intimin gene (eae) and the absence of stx 
and the E. coli adherence factor (EAF) plasmid (24). EPEC 
are a common cause of infantile diarrhea and travelers’ di­
arrhea and are known to cause mild diarrhea in adults (25). 
In this study, the fact that clinical cases infected with the 
E. coli O157:H7 stx-negative clone reported a similar fre­
quency of symptoms, including bloody diarrhea and hospi­
talization, as those infected with STEC O157:H7 stx2c de­
spite the loss of stx was an unexpected finding that requires 
further investigation.
A timed phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolution­
ary history of a cluster of sublineage IIb charted the recent 
emergence of a highly pathogenic clone of STEC O157:H7 
stx2a. The symptom of bloody diarrhea, a marker of sever­
ity and predictor of HUS development (2), was strongly 
associated with cases infected with isolates of STEC 
O157:H7 harboring stx2a compared with those isolates 
without stx or those with stx2c. Our analysis also illustrated 
the highly dynamic nature of the Stx-encoding phages. In 
contrast to the observed excision events of stx2c-encoding 
phages in O157:H7, there is evidence to suggest that once 
a Stx2a-encoding phage is integrated into a population it 
tends to be maintained (5). As such, the emergence of yet 
another sublineage of STEC O157:H7 acquiring stx2a is of 
public health concern. Through this study, we demonstrate 
that STEC O157:H7 WGS surveillance data have a role 
in monitoring and anticipating emerging threats to public 
health and in contributing to our understanding of the un­
derlying pathogenic mechanisms associated with severe 
gastrointestinal illness.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in live bird mar­
kets (LBMs) in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, to 
estimate the prevalence of avian influenza A(H5) and 
A(H9) viruses in different types of poultry and environ­
mental areas by using Bayesian hierarchical logistic re­
gression models. We detected these viruses in nearly all 
LBMs. Prevalence of A(H5) virus was higher in waterfowl 
than in chickens, whereas prevalence of A(H9) virus was 
higher in chickens than in waterfowl and, among chicken 
types, in industrial broilers than in cross-breeds and in­
digenous breeds. LBMs with >1 wholesaler were more 
frequently contaminated by A(H5) virus than retail-only 
LBMs. Prevalence of A(H9) virus in poultry and level of 
environmental contamination were also higher in LBMs 
with >1 wholesaler. We found a high level of circulation 
of both avian influenza viruses in surveyed LBMs. Preva­
lence was influenced by type of poultry, environmental 
site, and trading patterns.
L
ow pathogenicity avian influenza A(H9N2) virus and 
highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus are 
endemic in poultry populations in Bangladesh (1–4). In ad­
dition to their adverse effect on poultry production, these 
viruses have resulted in sporadic influenza cases in humans 
(2,3). Because there is potential for generating novel reas­
sortant variants between them or with other virus subtypes, 
their persistent circulation in poultry poses a serious threat 
to animal and human health globally (5–9).
Live bird markets (LBMs) form the backbone of poul­
try trade in many countries in Asia. Birds of different types 
and from different geographic areas are introduced daily 
into LBMs and might be caged together, promoting local 
transmission of multiple virus subtypes and generating op­
portunities for reassortment (10–12). Surveys and routine 
surveillance have described the abundance and diversity of 
avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) in LBMs in AIV-endemic 
countries, including Bangladesh (1,4,11,13–21). However, 
only the proportion of positive samples is usually reported, 
without accounting for the hierarchical data structure, es­
pecially the clustering of sampled poultry per LBM. There­
fore, a robust assessment of AIV prevalence in LBMs is 
lacking, although this knowledge is essential to understand 
AIV epidemiology and optimize surveillance design.
Multiple poultry species and, for each poultry spe­
cies, multiple breeds are offered for sale in LBMs in Ban­
gladesh. Desi, Sonali, and broiler are the most commonly 
traded chicken types. Desi, which means “local” in Ben­
gali, are indigenous chicken breeds raised in backyard 
farms. Sonali is a cross-breed of the Rhode Island Red 
cocks and Fayoumi hens. Broilers are industrial white-
feathered breeds. In addition to varying levels of suscep­
tibility, different poultry types might be raised in different 
farming systems and traded through different value chains 
(i.e., the range of activities that businesses perform to 
deliver products to customers), therefore being exposed 
to different pathogens and pathogen loads (22,23). How­
ever, the proportion of AIV-positive samples is gener­
ally reported as an overall estimate or stratified only by 
poultry species. Likewise, the relative position of indi­
vidual LBMs in a regional or national live poultry trad­
ing network might also affect AIV prevalence; the sources 
from which poultry are supplied to traders and the time 
they spend in LBMs influence the likelihood of virus in­
troduction and amplification in LBMs and vary depend­
ing on traders being wholesalers or retailers (12,24).

However, such information is generally poorly document­
ed, or even ignored.
To address these issues, we conducted a cross-section­
al survey in the 2 largest cities in Bangladesh, Dhaka and 
Chittagong, during February–March 2016. First, we esti­
mated prevalence of influenza A(H5) and A(H9) viruses 
in marketed poultry and the LBM environment. We also 
accounted for the clustering effect at LBM level by using 
Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression models. Second, 
we assessed the effect of type of poultry and environmental 
site, and the position of LBMs in the poultry value chain on 
AIV prevalence.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection
An LBM was defined as an open space in which >2 poultry 
stalls sell live poultry at least once a week, and only those 
selling >400 poultry/day were considered eligible for this 
study. We aimed to sample 40 LBMs, and from each of 
these LBMs, 60 birds and 50 environmental sites (sample 
size calculations in online Technical Appendix 1, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0879-Techapp1.
pdf). We used a stratified cluster sampling design. For 
poultry, LBMs, stalls within selected LBMs, and birds 
within selected stalls constituted the primary, secondary, 
and tertiary sampling units, respectively. For environmen­
tal sites, LBMs constituted primary sampling units and 
environmental sites within selected LBMs constituted sec­
ondary sampling units.
We stratified LBMs by city for Dhaka and Chittagong 
and, within each city, by poultry sales into large and small 
LBMs, hypothesizing that the risk for AIV infection var­
ies between geographic locations and the number of poul­
try traded. Also, simple random sampling with too small a 
sample size of LBMs was not likely to capture diversity of 
LBM types because the distribution of LBMs as a function 
of their size tended to be right-skewed; the largest LBMs 
were often wholesale markets (24,25). We hypothesized 
that samples of different origins have different AIV preva­
lences and thus stratified birds and environmental sites 
into 5 types of poultry and 10 types of environmental sites 
commonly found to be contaminated with AIV (26) (online 
Technical Appendix 2 Tables 1, 2, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/
EID/article/24/12/18-0879-Techapp2.pdf).
At the first sampling stage, we sampled 40 LBMs. 
The number of LBMs selected in Dhaka (n = 26) and Chit­
tagong (n = 14) was proportional to the number of LBMs 
eligible in each city (n = 80 for Dhaka and n = 36 for Chit­
tagong). In each city, we further stratified LBMs by size: 
50% of the selected LBMs were large, trading the highest 
number of poultry (13 largest LBMs in Dhaka and 7 largest 
LBMs in Chittagong); 50% were small, randomly selected 
from the bottom 50% of eligible LBMs in terms of number 
of poultry traded.
At the second sampling stage, we randomly selected 
stalls and environmental sites in each LBM independently 
for each type of poultry and environmental site. We cre­
ated a list of stalls selling each poultry type for each LBM. 
We then selected stalls from these lists by using a random 
number generator. Likewise, for each type of environmen­
tal site, we selected sites from a list of sites identified in 
each LBM by using a random number generator. We col­
lected 1 swab specimen from each environmental site. We 
pooled 5 swab specimens collected from the same LBM 
and site type.
At the third sampling stage, for each poultry type, we 
randomly selected 5 birds from each of the stalls selected 
for that type and collected cloacal and oropharyngeal swab 
specimens from each of the selected birds. We pooled 5 
swab specimens collected from the same stall and poultry 
type separately for cloacal and oropharyngeal swab speci­
mens. We transported samples collected in Chittagong 
on the day of sampling to the Chittagong Veterinary and 
Animal Sciences University (Chittagong) and samples col­
lected in Dhaka on the day of sampling to the Bangladesh 
Livestock Research Institute (Dhaka). Samples were stored 
at −80°C until diagnostic laboratory processing.
Sample Screening
We screened pools for AIVs by using a real-time reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and specific primers and 
probes (27,28). We extracted virus RNA by using the Mag­
MAX RNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and 
reverse transcribed and amplified virus RNA by using the 
AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR (ThermoFisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA). We then screened a pool with a cy­
cle threshold (Ct) <40 for the AIV matrix gene for the H5 
and H9 genes. Results were considered positive for the H5 
subtype if Ct <38 and positive for the H9 subtype if Ct<40 
(27,28). A pool was considered positive for AIV if its Ct 
for the AIV matrix gene <38 or if it was positive for any 
of the H5 and H9 subtypes. A given group of 5 birds was 
considered positive if any of its cloacal and oropharyngeal 
pools showed a positive result.
Bayesian Hierarchical Logistic Regression Models
We developed 2-level Bayesian hierarchical logistic regres­
sion models to estimate LBM-level, bird-level, and environ­
mental swab specimen–level prevalence from pooled swab 
samples, accounting for lower-level (swab specimens) and 
higher-level (LBMs) risk factors. We developed separate 
models for poultry and environmental samples to avoid pa­
rameters related to different sampling units interfering with 
each other (29). We used LBM type (retail or mixed), city 
(Chittagong or Dhaka), and size (small or large) as LBM-

level risk factors. We defined an LBM with only retailers 
(i.e., trader selling poultry to end-users only) as retail and 
an LBM with >1 wholesaler (i.e., trader selling poultry to 
other traders) as mixed. Each LBM-level risk factor (LBM 
type, city, and size) was assessed separately because we 
could not include them simultaneously in any given model 
due to the small number of sampled LBMs. In models for 
poultry samples, we differentiated birds into 1) chicken and 
waterfowl or 2) broiler, Desi, Sonali (i.e., chicken types), 
and waterfowl. Waterfowl were not differentiated further 
because of the small number of pools collected from ducks 
and geese. In models for environmental samples, we differ­
entiated environmental sites into stall and slaughter areas 
or classified as environmental area without differentiation. 
We ran models (online Technical Appendix 1) by using a 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation in JAGS (30) and 
R.3.4.2 (31).
Results
Descriptive Results for Pooled Swab Samples
We collected 477 pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal pooled 
samples from 2,384 birds, and 400 environmental pooled 
samples from 2,000 environmental sites in 40 LBMs in 
Chittagong and Dhaka. Each pool was composed of 5 swab 
specimens, except for 1 pair of cloacal and oropharyngeal 
pools made from 4 swab specimens collected from geese. 
We collected 12 pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal pooled 
samples from all LBMs, except for 11 pairs from 3 LBMs. 
We sampled chickens in all LBMs (8–12 pairs/LBM), and 
waterfowl in 25 LBMs (0–4 pairs/LBM). Broilers account­
ed for most samples (32.1%), followed by Desi (26.6%) 
and Sonali (25.6%). Ducks accounted for 76% of 75 pool 
pairs collected from waterfowl and geese accounted for 
24%. We collected 10 environmental pools in each LBM 
(stall areas: 4–8 pools, slaughter areas, 2–6 pools).
Of 47.4% (416/877) pools considered positive for 
AIV, 6.5% pools were negative for the AIV matrix gene 
but positive for any of the H9 and H5 subtypes. The H9 
subtype (63.2% positive pools) was detected more fre­
quently than the H5 subtype (21.6%), and 12.3% of pools 
were positive for both subtypes and 27.4% of pools were 
negative for both subtypes. Although 80.0% of the LBMs 
had >1 A(H5) virus–positive poultry or environmental 
pool, 97.5% had >1 A(H9) virus–positive poultry or en­
vironmental pool. We determined the prevalence of pools 
that were positive for A(H5) and A(H9) viruses according 
to sample and LBM type (Table 1).
Approximately 33.3% of pools collected from water­
fowl were positive for A(H5) virus, whereas only 5.5% of 
those collected from chickens were positive. In contrast, 
the prevalence of A(H9) virus–positive pools was higher 
in chickens (36.3%) than in waterfowl (18.7%). Among 
waterfowl, ducks (19.3%) and geese (16.7%) had a similar 
prevalence of A(H9) virus–positive pools, but the preva­
lence of A(H5) virus–positive pools was higher in ducks 
(36.8%) than in geese (22.2%). For both H5 and H9 sub­
types, the prevalence of positive pools was higher for oro­
pharyngeal samples (8.6% for H5 and 31.9% for H9) than 
for cloacal samples (3.6% and 9.9%) in all surveyed poul­
try types (online Technical Appendix 2 Table 1). 
Approximately 25% of environmental pools were pos­
itive for A(H9) virus, and the prevalence of positive pools 
was higher in slaughter areas (31.5%), especially knives 
and boards used for slaughter and processing, than stall 
areas (20.2%). The prevalence of A(H5) virus–positive en­
vironmental pools was lower (10.8%) and did not vary be­
tween slaughter and stall areas (online Technical Appendix 
2 Table 2).
Bayesian Model Results
Convergence was achieved for all models; the Gelman and 
Rubin statistic was <1.001 and the effective sample size 
was >10,000 for all parameters. For each AIV subtype, the 
best models reasonably predicted the number of positive 
pools (online Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1). In the best 
H5 models (i.e., lowest deviance information criterion), 
A(H5) virus prevalence differed according to poultry spe­
cies (chicken, waterfowl), but not according to the type 
of environmental site. In contrast, in the best H9 models, 
A(H9) virus prevalence differed according to type of poul­
try (broiler, Desi, Sonali, waterfowl) and environmental site 
(slaughter and stall area). For both subtypes, LBM size and 
city did not improve model fit when compared with LBM 
type. For ease of comparison between the 2 AIV subtypes, 
we report LBM-level, bird-level, and environmental swab 
specimen–level prevalences of A(H5) and A(H9) viruses 
on the basis of the best H9 models with LBM type (Tables 
1, 2). This reporting did not affect interpretation of results,  
and we provide estimates obtained with more parsimonious 
models (online Technical Appendix 2 Tables 3–6).
LBM-level A(H5) virus prevalence was lower in re­
tail LBMs than in mixed LBMs, and the posterior median 
estimate was ≈100% for mixed LBMs. However, among 
contaminated LBMs, levels of virus detection in birds and 
environmental areas did not vary between LBM types, but 
A(H5) virus prevalence in waterfowl was ≈6 times higher 
than in chickens (Figure). The prevalence did not vary be­
tween chicken breeds or environmental areas.
In contrast to that for A(H5) virus, we found that the 
posterior median estimate of the LBM-level A(H9) virus 
prevalence was ≈100% for retail and mixed LBM groups, 
but the level of virus detection in birds and environmental 
areas was higher for mixed LBMs than for retail LBMs. 
A(H9) virus prevalence was highest in broilers and lowest 
in waterfowl. The prevalence in broilers was 3.8 times as 
high as that in waterfowl and 1.6 times as high as that in 
Desi and Sonali (Figure). The environmental swab speci­
men–level prevalence was ≈2 times as high for slaughter 
areas than for stall areas (Figure).
Discussion
We detected A(H5) and A(H9) viruses in marketed poul­
try and environmental sites in nearly all LBMs sampled 
in Chittagong and Dhaka. The prevalence of A(H5) virus 
was higher in waterfowl than in chickens, whereas the 
prevalence of A(H9) virus was higher in chickens than 
waterfowl and also varied among chicken types, being 
more prevalent in broilers than in Desi and Sonali breeds. 
Slaughter areas were more frequently contaminated by 
A(H9) virus than stall areas. Whereas mixed LBMs were 
more frequently contaminated by A(H5) virus than were 
retail LBMs, prevalence of A(H9) virus was higher in 
mixed LBMs than in retail LBMs for birds and environ­
mental areas.
AIVs were ubiquitous in surveyed LBMs. The LBM-
level prevalence of A(H5) virus in Bangladesh was higher 
than in other AIV-endemic countries, including Egypt (32) 
and Vietnam (16). For both AIV subtypes, LBM-level 
prevalence was also higher than in another study conducted 
in Chittagong (21), which found that 17.5% of LBMs had 
>1 environmental sample pool contaminated by A(H5) vi­
rus and 12.5% of LBMs had >1 environmental sample pool 
contaminated by A(H9) virus. This difference might have 
been caused by different sampling schemes; in our study, 
we collected a larger number of pools per LBM.
Bird-level prevalence was also higher than that re­
ported in other AIV-endemic countries, including Ban­
gladesh (1,4,16,19). However, care must be taken when 
comparing these results because studies used different 
study designs and sample screening protocols over differ­
ent periods. Bird-level prevalence for contaminated LBMs 
was much higher than for virologic surveys conducted in 
backyard and commercial farms in Bangladesh (1,4,33,34). 
This finding suggests that virus transmission was amplified 
along the value chain from farms to LBMs. Overcrowding 
and continuous supply of susceptible birds of different spe­
cies and breeds might have created conditions promoting 
the silent transmission of AIVs within these markets (10).
Our results suggest that birds in LBMs with a mixture 
of wholesalers and retailers were at higher risk for infec­
tion than birds in LBMs with primarily retail poultry busi­
nesses. Poultry value chains supplying different business 
types might differ structurally, thereby affecting the risk for

Influenza Viruses in Live Bird Markets, Bangladesh
introduced birds being already infected. Wholesalers gen­
erally trade a larger number of birds from more diverse geo­
graphic origins than do retailers (23) and therefore might 
have increased likelihood of virus introduction into mixed 
LBMs. Moreover, because wholesalers might sell birds to 
retailers in the same LBM (23), virus amplification might 
be increased through the presence of wholesalers.
The higher prevalence of A(H9) virus in broilers than 
in Sonali and Desi might result from differences in the struc­
ture of their respective value chains (23). Depending on the 
chicken type, different value chain actors might be involved 
and their trading practices might differ (23). The amount 
of time chickens spend with traders, the density at which 
chickens are kept in flocks of traders, and the frequency of 
contact with chickens from other flocks might vary with 
chicken type. The greater number of broilers marketed in 
surveyed LBMs might mean that broilers are more likely 
than Desi and Sonali to be sourced from large numbers of 
flocks, which are then mixed in densely populated trucks 
during transport to LBMs, promoting AIV transmission. 
However, these prevalence patterns might also be caused 
by varying levels of genetic susceptibility to AIV infection 
(35,36). Further investigations are needed to disentangle 
the possible influences of trade-related and genetic factors 
on AIV transmission in these chicken types. The higher 
level of contamination with A(H9) virus in slaughter areas 
than in stall areas suggests that, in the absence of appropri­
ate biosecurity measures, slaughtering is likely to expose 
humans to AIVs by fomite transmission (37).
Co-circulation of A(H5) and A(H9) viruses arouses 
concerns over evolution of novel reassortant variants (5–
8). Detection of both subtypes in some poultry pools sug­
gests that these subtypes co-circulated near each other or 
in the same host during the study period. Although A(H5) 
viruses have considerable variability in their ability to in­
fect, cause disease, and be transmitted among waterfowl 
(38), waterfowl are generally known to be less suscep­
tible to highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) vi­
ruses (39). Therefore, waterfowl could harbor this virus 
but remain asymptomatic and serve as a potential host

for genesis of novel AIVs in the presence of other virus 
subtypes. Also, the high level of A(H9) virus circulation 
among chickens could provide an ideal environment for 
virus diversification and selection in the LBM system. 
The different prevalence patterns in chickens and water­
fowl observed suggest that these poultry species should 
be separated in LBMs and that active surveillance of nov­
el reassortant variants should be implemented.
This study had some limitations. First, our models only 
accounted for clustering of sampled birds at the LBM level, 
but not at stall level. It is plausible that clustering of sam­
ples at stall level has less influence on AIV infection prob­
ability across the study population than clustering at the 
LBM level because stallholders in a given LBM in Bangla­
desh are likely to be supplied by the same traders and trade 
between each another (23). However, potential risk factors 
at stall level, such as ducks and hygiene level (21), might 
cause heterogeneous levels of AIV infection across stalls.
Second, our models did not account for the fact 
that sampling units in each stratum were selected with 
unequal probabilities. Although we selected different 
numbers of birds for each poultry type to account for 
variations in poultry populations, birds were still se­
lected with different probabilities because their popula­
tions varied between clusters and strata. This selection 
might have resulted in larger SEs and thus less precise 
estimates compared with what could have been obtained 
with proportional sample sizes. Moreover, the overall 
prevalence might have been biased toward prevalence in 
samples selected with higher probabilities.
Third, our models assumed perfect sensitivity and spec­
ificity of real-time RT-PCR for pooled samples. The assays 
used in this study are considered highly sensitive and specif­
ic (27,28), and previous studies did not report any differenc­
es in virus detection for pooled and individual samples (40–
42). Furthermore, virus detection in our study was based on 
parallel interpretation of cloacal or oropharyngeal sample 
test results (i.e., positive if >1 was positive). However, pools 
that were negative for the AIV matrix gene but positive for 
any of the H5 and H9 subtypes indicate that accounting for 
actual test sensitivity and specificity would enable more 
robust prevalence estimation. Virus isolation might be at­
tempted for RT-PCR–positive pools to assess the viability 
of virus material. However, this testing was not attempted 
in our study. Each pool consisted of swab specimens from 
different birds or environmental sites. Thus, multiple AIV 
subtypes and virus species, including Newcastle disease vi­
ruses, could be present in the same pool and interfere with 
growth of each virus in chicken eggs (43). Should such stud­
ies be replicated, the collection of individual swab speci­
mens and their pooling at the laboratory is recommended to 
enable analysis of individual swab specimens that formed a 
virus-positive pool.
Fourth, we collected samples over a short period to 
reduce variability that could arise from seasonal varia­
tions in AIV prevalence. We focused on winter months, 
which are often reported to be periods of higher risk for 
AIV infection (44). Therefore, our estimates only repre­
sented AIV prevalence during that period and did not cap­
ture seasonal changes.
Contrary to previous cross-sectional studies, our ap­
proach enabled us to estimate AIV prevalence not only by 
poultry species but also by chicken type and account for the 
type of LBMs in which sampled poultry were marketed. 
Despite most AIV surveys and surveillance activities being 
based on multistage sampling, single-level analytic meth­
ods are generally used to analyze their results, while ignor­
ing within-market correlation in poultry infection status. 
Accounting for this effect by incorporating LBM-specific 
random effects in a hierarchical model, and enabling mutu­
al influence between bird-level, environmental swab speci­
men–level, and LBM-level parameters, improved the reli­
ability of prevalence estimates (29). When applied to other 
settings, this approach needs to be adapted on the basis of 
an understanding of the variety of poultry value chains. In­
formation about LBM locations and about trading practices 
and numbers and types of poultry sold within these LBMs 
is rarely readily available and would need to be collected to 
inform the study design.
In conclusion, LBMs surveyed in Bangladesh were 
highly contaminated by A(H5) and A(H9) viruses. The lev­
el of virus detection was associated with the type of poultry 
and environmental area and the presence of wholesalers in 
LBMs. These findings need to be included in the design of 
risk-based surveillance and control interventions aimed at 
reducing AIV prevalence, human exposure, and the risk for 
emergence of novel virus reassortant variants.

Twice a year in southwestern Nigeria, during a traditional 
bat festival, community participants enter designated caves 
to capture bats, which are then consumed for food or trad­
ed. We investigated the presence of Bartonella species in 
Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and bat flies 
(Eucampsipoda africana) from these caves and assessed 
whether Bartonella infections had occurred in persons from 
the surrounding communities. Our results indicate that 
these bats and flies harbor Bartonella strains, which multi­
locus sequence typing indicated probably represent a novel 
Bartonella species, proposed as Bartonella rousetti. In se­
rum from 8 of 204 persons, we detected antibodies to B. 
rousetti without cross-reactivity to other Bartonella species. 
This work suggests that bat-associated Bartonella strains 
might be capable of infecting humans.
B
ats are natural reservoirs for a variety of pathogens 
(1). However, despite the risk to human health, per­
sons around the world still intentionally handle bats, often 
without taking appropriate precautions. This lack of precau­
tions is particularly evident in the tropics, where bats are 
abundant and frequently roost within or in close proximity 
to humans and domestic animals. In Asia and Africa, larger 
fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) are used as food, for either 
cultural reasons or subsistence (2). In some cultures, bat 
caves serve as spiritual sanctuaries (3).
One particular situation that has attracted the attention 
of scientists is a bat festival that takes place biannually in 
the Idanre Hills area of Nigeria. During the festival, which 
has occurred for many years, men enter designated caves, 
often without appropriate personal protective equipment, 
to capture bats. Local customs forbid persons from enter­
ing the caves outside of these festivities without permission 
from the community leadership. The captured bats are then 
eaten, used in cultural rituals, or sold as bushmeat (3). The 
predominant bat species within the caves is the Egyptian 
fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus); colony sizes can reach 
>1,000 (4). Egyptian fruit bats are known reservoirs of zoo­
notic pathogens including Lagos bat virus, Marburg virus, 
and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (5–8). Given the close 
human-to-bat contact that occurs during the festival, there 
is a risk for spillover of batborne pathogens to humans.
The genus Bartonella currently includes >30 species 
of bacteria (9), many of which have been described only 
recently. Various arthropod vectors seem to play an es­
sential role in the maintenance and transmission of most 
known Bartonella species (9,10). In recent years, recog­
nition of multiple Bartonella species as human pathogens 
responsible for a wide range of clinical manifestations has 
grown. Numerous novel strains of Bartonella have been 
discovered in bats of various species around the globe, in­
cluding the human pathogen Candidatus Bartonella mayo­
timonensis, which was originally detected in aortic valve 
tissue of a person with endocarditis (11–13). In addition, a 
novel Bartonella genotype found in bats from the country 
of Georgia clustered with genotypes found in human forest 
workers from Poland (14).

During 2010 and 2013, we researched the health risk to 
humans participating in the Idanre bat festival. We sampled 
bats and their ectoparasites from the caves and used them to 
identify a variety of zoonotic pathogens, including Barton­
ella. We recruited human participants from the surrounding 
community and surveyed them (through an orally adminis­
tered questionnaire and serologic testing) to understand risk 
factors and the occurrence of pathogen spillover from bats 
to humans. We examined whether bats and ectoparasites of 
these bats within the caves used in the Idanre bat festival 
are infected with Bartonella, characterized any Bartonella 
species identified in bats or bat flies, and screened human 
serum samples for evidence of Bartonella infection.
Materials and Methods
Human subjects work was approved by the Centers for Dis­
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) Institutional Review 
Board, the Ahmadu Bello University Human Ethics Board, 
and the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Ni­
geria. All animal procedures were conducted in compliance 
with a field protocol approved by the CDC Animal Institu­
tional Care and Use Committee.
Field Sites, Bat Capture, and Sample Collection
We captured bats by nets in 2 caves in Idanre Hills, Ondo 
State, southwestern Nigeria, in September 2010 (n = 106) 
and February 2013 (n = 71). We identified all bats by 
morphologic characteristics as Egyptian fruit bats (R. ae­
gyptiacus). Captured bats were anesthetized by intramus­
cular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (0.05–0.1 mg/g 
bat weight) and exsanguinated via cardiac puncture after 
surface sterilization with 75% alcohol. Serum and blood 
clots were separated by centrifugation. Clots were stored at 
–80°C except while still in the field or being shipped, dur­
ing which time they were stored on dry ice. 
Bat Blood Culture and Characterization of 
Bartonella Strain
We plated bat blood clots on heart infusion agar containing 
10% rabbit blood and incubated in an aerobic atmosphere 
with 5% carbon dioxide at 35°C for up to 4 weeks. Bacte­
rial colonies morphologically identified as Bartonella were 
subcultured to obtain pure cultures.
We prepared crude genomic DNA by heating a heavy 
suspension of pure culture for 10 minutes at 95°C, followed 
by centrifugation of the lysed cells for 1 minute at 3,000 
rpm. The supernatant was then transferred to a clean centri­
fuge tube to be used as the template DNA. We first verified 
all isolates obtained from the blood clots as Bartonella spp. 
by PCR amplification targeting a fragment of the citrate 
synthase gene (gltA) (15). Positive (B. doshiae) and nega­
tive (deionized water) controls were included to ensure that 
the PCR worked properly.
We purified and sequenced all PCR products of gltA 
in both directions by using an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). We used the 
Lasergene software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, 
USA) to compare the generated gltA sequences with all 
available Bartonella species/genotypes. Once the sequenc­
es were identified, we selected 1 representative strain (R-
191) for further characterization with multilocus sequence 
typing on the basis of sequence analysis of 8 molecular 
markers (ftsZ, gltA, nuoG, ribC, rpoB, ssrA, 16S rRNA, 
and internal transcribed spacers [ITS]) (16). For phyloge­
netic analyses, we used the neighbor-joining method by the 
Kimura 2-parameter distance method and bootstrap calcu­
lations with 1,000 replicates.
Bat Ectoparasite Collection and Detection of 
Bartonella DNA
We collected ectoparasites from the skin and pelage of bats 
and stored them in microcentrifuge tubes with 70% etha­
nol. Ectoparasite species were identified by using available 
morphologic keys (17), and identifications were later con­
firmed by sequencing of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and 
cytochrome oxidase I (COI) genes (18,19).
Using a Bullet Blender Gold homogenizer (Next Ad­
vance, Averill Park, NY, USA), we homogenized whole 
ectoparasites in Navy Eppendorf bead tubes (Next Ad­
vance) containing 400 µL brain–heart infusion broth (CDC, 
Atlanta, GA, USA). We extracted DNA from the homog­
enates by using the KingFisher Flex Purification System 
and the associated MagMAX Pathogen RNA/DNA Kit 
(both ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocols. Detection of Bartonella DNA in 
ectoparasite samples was performed by nested PCR for 
gltA (20) because of low concentrations of DNA and by 
conventional PCR for ITS (21), followed by sequencing 
and sequence analysis of amplicons.
Preparation of Antigen from the Bartonella Strain 
Obtained from Bats
We produced a whole-cell antigen by co-cultivating Vero E6 
cells with the pure culture (≈106 agar-grown organisms) of 
the Bartonella strain (R-191) obtained from Egyptian fruit 
bats. Both were put into T-150 flasks that contained mini­
mum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf 
serum, 10 mmol HEPES buffer solution, 10 mmol nonessen­
tial amino acids, and 2 mmol L-glutamine. The flasks were 
incubated at 35°C and harvested on postinoculation day 4. 
At harvest, all but 2 mL of the medium was removed from 
the flask, sterile glass beads were added, and the flask was 
gently rocked to remove the Vero E6 cell monolayer. Drops 
(≈15 µL) of the cell suspension were mounted on each well 
of 12-well glass slides, which were then air dried, fixed in 
acetone for 15 minutes, and stored at –70°C until use.

Human Serum Collection and Testing for Antibodies 
Persons in communities surrounding the caves who gave 
consent were enrolled in the study 11–15 days after the first 
bat festival of 2013 (February 19, 2013); not all of these 
persons had participated in all bat festival activities. Partici­
pants were asked about their contact with bats and their role 
in the festival, and some provided a blood sample (consid­
ered an acute-phase specimen). About 69–78 days later, a 
follow-up survey was conducted and a second blood sample 
(considered a convalescent-phase specimen) was collected 
(the second bat festival of 2013 did not take place between 
collection of the acute- and convalescent-phase samples). 
Serum and blood clots were separated by centrifugation; 
serum was stored at –80°C except while in the field or be­
ing shipped, during which time it was stored on dry ice.
To screen human serum, we used an indirect immu­
nofluorescence assay at an initial dilution of 1:32 for IgG 
against the specific Bartonella antigen from the bat-associ­
ated isolate. Antigen-covered wells of the slide were over­
laid with dilutions of human serum. Separate slides were 
included with positive and negative controls. The positive 
control against the Egyptian fruit bat–associated Barton­
ella species was produced in laboratory mice via mouse 
immunization with heat-inactivated bacterium (ProSci In­
corporated, Poway, CA, USA). All slides were incubated 
at 35°C for 30 minutes and then washed in phosphate-buff­
ered saline for 15 minutes. We used anti-human and anti-
mouse conjugates (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., 
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for human and control serum 
samples, respectively. Each human serum sample reactive 
at the initial dilution was further titrated in 2-fold dilutions 
to endpoint; to check for cross-reactivity, we tested the fi­
nal positive samples (defined as a titer >1:64) for 3 other 
Bartonella antigens (B. elizabethae, B. henselae, and B. 
quintana) previously reported in Africa (22–24).
Results
Bartonella in Egyptian Fruit Bats
We recovered Bartonella isolates from 22 of 177 Egyptian 
fruit bat blood clots, giving an overall prevalence of 12.4%. 
The gltA sequences of all Bartonella strains obtained from 
Egyptian fruit bats were identical or similar (>97% identity) 
to each other and represented 4 unique variants (GenBank 
accession nos. HM363764, MH069693–MH069695). A 
variant is defined when it differs by >1 nt from others. To­
gether with Bartonella strains obtained from Egyptian fruit 
bats in Kenya (25), these variants constitute a monophy­
letic genogroup that is distant from all other genotypes pre­
viously found in other bat species and any other described 
Bartonella species.
Multilocus sequence typing of the type strain (gltA; 
GenBank accession no. HM363764) with 7 additional 
genetic loci (ftsZ, nuoG, ribC, rpoB, ssrA, 16S rRNA, 
and ITS) further confirmed the uniqueness of this strain. 
Sequencing information for each genetic marker demon­
strated that the Bartonella strain from the Egyptian fruit 
bats was distant from all other known Bartonella species 
and genotypes, including those reported from other bats 
from Africa. Sequences of all genetic loci obtained dur­
ing the analyses were deposited in GenBank (accession 
nos. HM363769, KM387321, HM363779, HM363774, 
KM382247, HM363784, and KM382255). We compared 
the fragment sequences of each target with those from other 
Bartonella species/genotypes. The Egyptian fruit bat–asso­
ciated Bartonella formed a separate genetic group that was 
distant from all other Bartonella species with >20% genetic 
distance and probably represents a novel Bartonella spe­
cies, according to the definition of La Scola et al. (26). We 
proposed that this bacterial species be named Bartonella 
rousetti, to reflect the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyp­
tiacus) as the natural host. A phylogenetic tree based on the 
ITS locus illustrates the relationship of this proposed novel 
species to other Bartonella species (Figure).
Identification of Bat Flies and Detection of 
Bartonella DNA
In 2013, we collected 51 ectoparasites from Egyptian fruit 
bats. With the exception of 1 unidentified mite, all arthro­
pods were identified as the bat fly Eucampsipoda africana 
Theodor (Diptera: Nycteribiidae). The morphologic identi­
fication of every bat fly was confirmed by 1 or both mito­
chondrial markers (16S rRNA or COI). Representative 16S 
rRNA (accession nos. MH138030–MH138037) and COI 
(accession nos. MH151059–MH151066) sequences have 
been deposited in GenBank.
Of the 50 DNA extracts from bat flies, 21 (42%) pro­
duced >1 ITS or gltA sequence that was confirmed via 
BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) as Bar­
tonella. Positive samples yielded 19 ITS sequences and 18 
gltA sequences; 16 samples yielded sequences for both loci 
and 5 samples yielded only 1 sequence. All but 1 of the 19 
ITS sequences matched closely to the proposed B. rousetti 
(>95% sequence identity) (Figure); the remaining sequence 
was identical to B. tamiae (DQ395180). Of the 18 (66.7%) 
gltA sequences, 12 were close matches for B. rousetti 
(>98.3% sequence identity); all 12 of these samples also 
produced ITS sequences matching this strain.
The remaining 6 gltA sequences were identical to Bar­
tonella sequences detected in a louse (Neohaematopinus 
sciuri) collected from a dead Eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus 
carolinensis) at a zoo in Greenville, SC, USA (GenBank 
accession no. EU368000) and an unidentified tick collected 
from a sheep in Peru (GenBank accession no. AF415209). 
These sequences were also closely (>99% sequence iden­
tity) related to other sequences from fleas (Ctenocephalides 
felis and C. canis) collected from dogs in Tunisia (GenBank 
accession nos. KP126468–74), a louse pool (Polyplax spp. 
and Hoplopleura spp.) collected from rodents in Thailand 
(GenBank accession no. KT324560), and an unidentified 
flea collected from a dog in Peru (GenBank accession no. 
GU583843). Of the specimens with this particular gltA se­
quence, 2 yielded no ITS sequence, 3 yielded ITS sequenc­
es matching B. rousetti, and 1 yielded the single B. tamiae 
sequence. Representative ITS (GenBank accession nos. 
MH14262–MH142639) and gltA (GenBank accession nos. 
MH151067–79) sequences for each novel sequence variant 
were submitted to GenBank.
Human Exposure to B. rousetti
A total of 305 serum samples from 204 participants were 
tested for IgG against B. rousetti; 12 samples from differ­
ent persons showed reactivity at an initial dilution of 1:32. 
Further 2-fold titration confirmed that 8 were positive, with 
titers >1:64 (Table). The positive samples were retested for 
3 other Bartonella species—B. henselae, B. quintana, and 
B. elizabethae, all of which have been reported in Africa 
(22–24); antibodies against these Bartonella species were 
not detected in any of the samples. Five seropositive partic­
ipants reported having eaten bats and having either touched 
bats or been scratched or bitten by them, although not all 
reported having ever participated in the bat festival. Three 
seropositive participants reported never having eaten bats, 
touched bats, or been scratched or bitten by bats; in addi­
tion, these 3 participants claimed to have never participated 
in the bat festival. Of the 8 seropositive participants, only 1 
reported having experienced a febrile illness since the bat 
festival that had taken place earlier in the year.
Discussion
We made several observations during this investigation. 
First, Egyptian fruit bats carry a unique Bartonella strain 
Figure. Phylogenetic relationships of Bartonella rousetti (proposed name) obtained from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) 
collected in Nigeria, 2010 and 2013, and other Bartonella species and bat-associated Bartonella based on internal transcribed spacer 
sequences. The neighbor-joining method by the Kimura 2-parameter distance method and bootstrap calculation was conducted with 
1,000 replicates for phylogenetic analysis. The internal transcribed spacer sequence obtained from the bat flies was closely clustered 
with B. rousetti. GenBank accession numbers are provided for the B. rousetti sequence and the comparison sequences.

Human Exposure to Novel Bartonella Species
that probably represents a new species, for which we pro­
pose the name Bartonella rousetti. Second, bat flies, the 
common ectoparasites of bats, carry this same strain of 
Bartonella. Because this organism was detected by PCR 
only, the presence of the DNA does not necessarily indicate 
that the organism is viable. Last, persons from the commu­
nities surrounding the bat caves were exposed to this partic­
ular Bartonella strain, which might cause human infection.
Since 2010, several reports have described finding di­
verse Bartonella genotypes in bats of many species (25,27–
30). The relationships between Bartonella genotypes and bat 
species that harbored these bacteria are not always simple. 
The same Bartonella species may circulate among different 
bat species, showing no specific relationship between the bats 
and the Bartonella species (27). Sometimes, multiple Barton­
ella species are associated with bats of only 1 species. For ex­
ample, 6 Bartonella species have been identified in straw-col­
ored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Africa (16,29). Our study 
indicates that Egyptian fruit bats carry a specific Bartonella 
strain that has not been identified in bats of other species. 
Similarly, we found that the most prevalent Bartonella 
species found in bat flies parasitizing Egyptian fruit bats is 
B. rousetti. The ectoparasite bat flies E. africana are pre­
dominantly associated with Egyptian fruit bats (17,31,32). 
Although sequences matching other Bartonella species 
were identified in the bat flies, these genogroups may be 
primarily associated with arthropods and not mammals. 
One sequence from a bat fly was identified as B. tamiae. 
The presence of B. tamiae in bat flies from Algeria has been 
recorded (33), and the bacterium reportedly has been iden­
tified in chigger mites collected from rodents in Thailand 
(34). It is possible that Bartonella species found only in ar­
thropods and not their associated mammal hosts may repre­
sent facultative symbionts that are uniquely adapted to live 
in the arthropod gut or other body system (35,36). The risks 
posed to humans by these primarily arthropod-associated 
Bartonella species are still unclear, although B. tamiae is a 
reported human pathogen that may cause febrile illness and 
other clinical signs and symptoms (37).
Detection of antibodies against B. rousetti in serum 
samples from several study participants indicates their 
exposure to the bacteria. However, with serologic results, 
cross-reactivity is a concern. For example, phylogeneti­
cally closely related B. henselae and B. quintana (the caus­
ative agents of cat-scratch disease and trench fever, respec­
tively) exhibit a high level of serologic cross-reactivity 
(26,38,39). We tested the positive human serum samples 
for 3 other Bartonella species (B. henselae, B. quintana, 
and B. elizabethae) that circulate in Africa, and we did not 
detect any positive results. Given that immunofluorescence 
assays have good discriminatory ability for a wide range 
of antigens (40–42), the results lead us to conclude that the 
antibodies in these participants were indeed reactive with 
B. rousetti but not the other Bartonella species tested, al­
though cross-reactivity with other non-Bartonella agents 
cannot be ruled out. 
Our study is not the first attempt to identify antibodies 
against bat-associated Bartonella in humans. Mannerings 
et al. (43) conducted a serologic survey of 335 volunteers 
from Ghana for antibodies against 6 species of Bartonella, 
including Bartonella strains isolated from straw-colored 
fruit bats. In that study, only 2 serum samples were positive 
for B. henselae antibodies at low titers, whereas none was 
positive against the bat strains.
All known species of Bartonella are transmitted between 
natural animal hosts by arthropods (29,44). The presence of 
B. rousetti DNA in E. africana bat flies parasitizing Egyptian 
fruit bats suggests that these ectoparasites may act as vectors 
for the transmission of Bartonella infection among bats, but 
it is unclear how bat flies would play a role in transmitting the 
bacterium to humans because bat flies do not commonly bite 
humans (C. McKee, unpub. data). Instead, human exposure 
may potentially occur via other routes, such as 1) directly by 
bat bites or scratches, which is similar to how humans acquire 
infections with B. henselae through cat scratches (10,45); 2) 
indirectly by contamination of open wounds with blood or 
other materials (e.g., saliva, urine, feces) of infected bats; or 
3) indirectly by contamination of open wounds with bat fly

*Bartonella rousetti is the proposed name for the novel Bartonella species identified in Egyptian fruit bats in Nigeria. 
†Acute-phase samples collected within 11–15 d after first bat festival of 2013; convalescent-phase samples collected 69–78 d after acute-phase sample

excreta. Several studies have reported detecting Bartonella 
DNA in bat feces (12,46,47), and Dietrich et al. (47) detected 
Bartonella DNA in bat saliva and urine, providing support for 
routes 1 and 2 above, although no attempts have been made 
to culture viable bacteria from these fluids. However, viable 
Bartonella bacteria have been cultured from experimentally 
infected ectoparasites, including fleas and bedbugs (48,49), 
although such studies have yet to be performed for bat flies. 
Nevertheless, evidence is accumulating that Bartonella could 
spread from infected mammalian hosts through multiple 
routes. Therefore, it may not be necessary for humans to in­
teract directly with live bats to be exposed to bat-associated 
Bartonella. Persons might be at risk when interacting with 
bat carcasses, guano, or other contaminated products. Of 
note, we do not provide definitive evidence of the route of 
exposure for any of the 8 seropositive participants. Indeed, 3 
of these participants reported no interactions at all with bats.
Future studies should continue to evaluate the relative 
correlations of exposure routes, the pathobiology of bat­
borne B. rousetti in humans, and vector competency of bat 
flies for transmitting Bartonella. Results should provide 
guidance to communities for mitigating the risks to humans 
interacting with animals and their arthropod vectors.

Sand fly–borne phleboviruses are associated with febrile 
diseases and nervous system infections in the Mediter­
ranean basin. Sandfly fever was first reported in the Bal­
kan Peninsula at the end of the 19th century. Since then, 
accumulating data show that the Balkan Peninsula, as a 
transboundary region between Asia and Europe, plays a 
major role in the emergence of vectorborne diseases in 
Europe. To provide an inclusive approach, we collected 
published data on phleboviruses in the Balkan countries 
and used them to evaluate the impact of these pathogens 
from virologic, epidemiologic, and public health perspec­
tives. Recent findings show a high diversity of phlebo­
viruses belonging to 3 species or serocomplexes circu­
lating heavily in the Balkans. Focusing on undisputable 
human pathogens, we found direct and indirect labora­
tory documentation for Toscana virus, Sandfly fever Sicil­
ian virus, and Adria virus. These data demonstrate that 
the Balkans are a hotspot for phleboviruses transmitted 
by sand flies.
P
hleboviruses (genus Phlebovirus, family Phenuiviri­
dae, order Bunyavirales) are 80–120 nm in length 
and display helical symmetry. Their genome consists of 3 
segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA: the large 
segment encodes the viral RNA polymerase (RdRp), the 
medium segment encodes envelope glycoproteins (Gn and 
Gc), and the small segment encodes nucleocapsid protein 
(N) and nonstructural protein (NS) (1,2). The segmented 
nature of the genome allows recombination and reassort­
ment to occur with the potential to generate new viruses 
with distinct ancestors (3,4). Segment reassortment in Bu­
nyavirales has been reported with increasing frequency, 
especially in the genus Orthobunyavirus (5). Specifically, 
reassortant viruses have been described in both Candiru 
and Rift Valley fever species (5,6).
Two sand fly–borne phleboviruses in the Old World 
were historically associated with cases of sandfly fever: 
Sicilian virus and Naples virus (7). Later, Naples virus 
was renamed sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV), which 
is included in the Sandfly fever Naples virus species. Like­
wise, Sicilian virus was renamed sandfly fever Sicilian virus 
(SFSV), which is still a tentative species. SFSV and SFNV 
are both responsible for sandfly fever, a self-limiting but 
incapacitating febrile illness. Toscana virus (TOSV), dis­
covered in 1971, was incriminated as causing central and 
peripheral nervous system infections in 1983 (8,9). TOSV 
can cause aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis (9–
12), as well as a number of other manifestations affecting 
the central and peripheral nervous system. These viruses are 
transmitted via bites of Phlebotomus spp. sand flies.
Data concerning the geographic distribution of SFSV, 
SFNV, and TOSV have drastically increased during the 
past 2 decades, resulting in a more accurate cartography of 
their presence in the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, 
and central Asia (12–16).
The Balkan Peninsula is a principal region for sand­
fly fever. It is located in southeastern Europe, and consists 
of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of 
Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, Ro­
mania, Serbia, and Kosovo. The Balkan region is composed 
of 3 very different natural entities: the Adriatic littoral in 
the southwest, the Pannonian plain in the northeast, and a 
broad expanse of mountainous regions in between. The first 
record of sandfly fever originated in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
at the end of the 19th century (online Technical Appen­
dix Table, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/17-
1626-Techapp1.pdf). During World War I and World War 
II, sandfly fever affected great numbers of soldiers in the 
region (17,18) (online Technical Appendix Table). In ad­
dition to historical data, recent reports show the activity 
of several novel viruses with severe human infections. We 
reviewed all the published data for sand fly–borne phlebo­
viruses in the Balkan Peninsula to provide a comprehensive 
view of the current situation and of the public health effect 
on humans and vertebrate animals in the region.
Methods
We searched global web-based resources (PubMed [www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed], Google Scholar [https://schol­
ar.google.com/], and Web of Science [https://isiknowl­
edge.com]) to collect all the sand fly–borne phlebovirus 
data from the Balkan region. In addition, we investigated

We obtained all the accessible virus sequences from 
Balkan countries from GenBank. We aligned 589 nt partial 
nucleoprotein sequences and analyzed them with MEGA 
software version 6 (https://www.megasoftware.net/). We 
constructed a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining 
method (Figure 1) and tested the robustness of each node 
by 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Results
We collected 51 published articles: 2 articles from Alba­
nia, 7 from Bosnia-Herzegovina, 11 from Croatia, 17 from 
Greece, 5 from Kosovo, 1 from Republic of Macedonia, 
and 7 from Serbia (online Technical Appendix Table). One 
reference from Bulgaria was not available (online Techni­
cal Appendix Table). We found no published data from 
Montenegro and Romania. Most of the references included 
data concerning seroprevalence studies conducted in hu­
mans or animals (online Technical Appendix Table). Sev­
eral articles reported results about either virus characteriza­
tion or case reports/outbreak investigations (19–25) (online 
Technical Appendix Table).
Historical Data on Phleboviruses in the Balkans
Alois Pick made a clinical description of sandfly fever in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina military barracks from foreign sol­
diers at the end of the 19th century (Online Technical Ap­
pendix Table ). Pick, an Austro-Hungarian military doctor 
working in Trebinje (Herzegovina), characterized the syn­
drome observed in cases of sandfly fever (26). Sandfly fe­
ver was observed both in local populations and in visitors, 
specifically foreign soldiers. In 1904, Taussig noticed the 
presence of “pappataci” sand flies in army barracks in Her­
zegovina  and conducted a large clinical and epidemiologic 
study in the region (27). The “endemic disease” emerged 
only in places where sand flies were present. Subsequently, 
the causative agent was discovered as a filterable agent (vi­
rus) that used pappataci sand flies as a vector (18). 
During World War II, sandfly fever affected great 
numbers of foreign soldiers in all Mediterranean region 
and Balkan countries during the summer seasons, when 
sand fly activity peaks (17). The disease was called phle­
botomus fever, pappataci fever, or three-day fever. In 
1937, a massive outbreak occurred in Athens, Greece 
(online Technical Appendix Table). After World War II, 
sandfly fever epidemics were recorded in Belgrade, Ser­
bia, affecting thousands of persons and then expanding 
into other regions of the Balkans (27) (online Technical 
Appendix Table). Although these articles could be the 
first record of sandfly fever based on clinical and epide­
miologic grounds, there is no scientific evidence to dem­
onstrate whether the disease described in the articles was 
sandfly fever caused by phlebovirus.
The seminal seroprevalence study using a neutral­
ization assay, by Tesh et al. in 1976, showed that SFNV 
and SFSV had circulated and were likely to continue to 
infect human populations in the tested regions (online 
Technical Appendix Table). Also in 1976, Gligić et al. 
isolated a strain of SFNV (Yug Bogdanovac virus strain 
Yu 8/76) from P. perfiliewi sand flies in the Dobrič re­
gion of Serbia. Other strains of SFNV and SFSV were 
also isolated in Serbia from P. pappatasi sand flies, but 
no accessible sequence data are available (24). At the 
time of isolation, SFNV and SFSV identification was 
done using mouse hyperimmune ascitis fluid for neutral­
ization assays and acetone sucrose antigens for comple­
ment fixation tests. SFNV strain YU-8-76 is available in 
the Yale University catalog, now stored at the University 
of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Partial sequence 
of this strain has been determined and confirmed the 
strain as belonging to the Sandfly fever Naples virus spe­
cies (28,29).
In 1985, Corfou virus, closely related to but distinct 
from SFSV, was isolated from P. neglectus sand flies col­
lected in the island of Corfou, Greece (online Technical 
Appendix Table). Corfou and SFSV can be distinguished 
only by neutralization assays, unlike other serologic assays 
(ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition [HI], indirect immu­
nofluorescence [IIF], complement fixation [CF]). Several 
studies have confirmed the presence of antibodies against 
both SFNV and SFSV in several areas of the Balkans (20) 
(online Technical Appendix Table).
Toscana Virus in the Balkan Region
In 1993, a German traveler was infected with TOSV af­
ter visiting Athens; diagnosis was established from im­
munofluorescence serology results, and it is therefore 
classified as a probable case rather than a laboratory-
confirmed case (online Technical Appendix Table). Re­
cent serologic studies have provided evidence of TOSV 
presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Croatia, and 
Sand Fly–Borne Phleboviruses in the Balkan Region
Greece (online Technical Appendix Table). Several hu­
man cases documented serologically as TOSV infections 
have been reported in Greece (23) (online Technical Ap­
pendix Table).
In Croatia, TOSV RNA was detected in the cere­
brospinal fluid of a patient infected with meningitis; 
sequence analysis showed that he was infected with a 
strain belonging to a genetic lineage that had not been 
previously recognized (subsequently named lineage C), 
which was clearly distinct from lineages A and B (on­
line Technical Appendix Table). Subsequently, TOSV 
lineage C was detected from a patient in Greece (on­
line Technical Appendix Table); unfortunately, the virus 
was not isolated in both cases and therefore only par­
tial sequence data are available. Later, sequences ob­
tained from P. neglectus sand flies confirmed the pres­
ence of lineage C TOSV but also showed that lineage 
B TOSV was present and that both genetic types 
were sympatric in Croatia (Figure 2; online Technical 
Appendix Table).

Sand Fly–Borne Phleboviruses in the Balkan Region
New Phleboviruses Identified from Partial 
Genomic Sequences
A novel phlebovirus, Adria virus, was detected in 2 pools 
of sand flies collected in Albania in 2005 (online Techni­
cal Appendix Table). Adria virus is most closely related to 
Arbia virus, which was isolated in Italy (8); both belong to 
the Salehabad phlebovirus species. Adria virus RNA was 
detected in the blood of a 2.5-year-old patient with febrile 
seizures in Greece (online Technical Appendix Table). 
This evidence showed that a virus within the Salehabad 
phlebovirus species could be associated with human dis­
ease (Figure 2). 
Balkan virus (BALKV) was detected from 2 pools 
of P. neglectus sand flies in Albania in 2014, 1 pool from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2014–15, and 4 pools from Croa­
tia in 2015 (online Technical Appendix Table). Sequence 
data analysis showed that BALKV belongs to the Sand­
fly fever Naples virus species, where it clusters with sub­
group I together with Tehran, Zerdali, Fermo, and SFNV 
YU 8–76 viruses respectively discovered in Iran, Turkey, 
Italy, and Serbia (30–32) (Figure 2; online Technical Ap­
pendix Table). 
New Phleboviruses Identified from Complete 
Genomic Sequences
Bregalaka virus (BREV) was isolated in P. perfiliewi 
sand flies from the Republic of Macedonia in 2015. Se­
quence analysis demonstrated that BREV is most closely 
related to Adana virus, which was isolated in Turkey 
from field-collected sand flies in 2012. In Croatia, Zaba 
virus (ZABAV) was isolated from P. neglectus sand 
flies. ZABAV is most closely related to Adria virus and 
Salehabad virus. Both BREV and ZABAV belong to the 
Salehabad phlebovirus species (online Technical Ap­
pendix Table).
Human and Animal Exposure to Phleboviruses
SFSV and SFNV are both responsible for a febrile illness 
that is self-limited but incapacitating, with signs that are 
commonly observed in arboviral diseases, such as fever, 
headache, malaise, photophobia, myalgia, and retroorbital 
pain. From a clinical perspective, it is impossible to distin­
guish SFNV from SFSV infections, and also to discrimi­
nate between SFNV/SFSV and other arboviral infections. 
As mentioned previously, historic records were based on 
clinical and epidemiologic evidence, but virological docu­
mentation was lacking for studies before the 1950s (Figure 
2; online Technical Appendix Table). 
Although SFSV and SFNV infections are clinically 
indistinguishable from each other, they are caused by ge­
netically and antigenically different viruses. Infection with 
SFNV does not induce cross-protection against SFSV and 
vice versa (33). As mentioned previously, neutralization 
test is the only technique that permits undisputable identi­
fication at the specific and intraspecific levels. Other tech­
niques, such as ELISA, CF, HI, and IFA, which are prone 
to cross-reactions, cannot achieve unambiguous identifica­
tion at the intraspecific or at the interspecific level.
Seroprevalence studies conducted in the Balkans from 
1976 onward have described antibodies in human popula­
tions confirming exposure to several phleboviruses trans­
mitted by sand flies. Complement-fixation tests showed 
antibodies against SFNV in Bosnia-Herzegovina (online 
Technical Appendix Table), and HI tests showed anti­
bodies against SFNV and SFSV in the islands of Croatia 
(Table; online Technical Appendix Table). In Greece, 
neutralizing antibodies against SFNV and SFSV were de­
scribed; 36% of persons >30 of age showed positive results 
for SFSV, and 13% showed positive results for SFNV. 
Persons <30 years of age had much lower rates, suggest­
ing that the antimalarial campaign had drastically reduced

Sand Fly–Borne Phleboviruses in the Balkan Region
TOSV was discovered in 1971, but it was identified as a 
human pathogen 12 years later, which prevented early in­
clusion in the seroprevalence studies; thus, almost no data 
exist for TOSV before the 1990s.
Recent data have confirmed the circulation of TOSV 
and associated human cases in Kosovo, Greece, and Croatia. 
In Croatia, 2 risk factors were associated with TOSV posi­
tive serology: living on an island and age (online Technical 
Appendix Table). Possible presence of TOSV was assessed 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina through immune-line assays (online 
Technical Appendix Table). TOSV neutralizing antibodies 
were detected in cats and dogs in Greece and in cattle and 
sheep in Kosovo (Figure 2; online Technical Appendix Table). 
Discussion
Sand fly–borne diseases are widespread in the Balkan region 
because of the favorable climate and socioeconomic condi­
tions in that area. After the first record of sandfly fever in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina at the end of the 19th century (online 
Technical Appendix Table), several outbreaks occurred in 
the whole Balkan region. Epidemics of sandfly fever and 
leishmaniasis prompted faunistic and ecologic investigations 
of sand flies from 1947 through the 1970s (33). The number 
of studies on sand fly fauna has decreased since that time 
because of the decline in recorded sandfly fever cases. For 
some Balkan countries, almost nothing is known about sand 
fly distribution; when data are available, they are too old to 
reflect the current situation accurately. The collapse of the 
former Yugoslavia and subsequent armed conflicts have also 
contributed to the lack of sustained studies on sand fly–borne 
pathogens in this region. However, recent data show that the 
Balkan region is still a major hotspot for arboviral diseases. 
Most virus studies are based on serosurveillance. 
The seminal neutralization-based seroprevalence study, 
performed by Tesh et al. in the 1970s, identified antibod­
ies against SFNV and SFSV in human populations from 
Croatia, Greece, and Kosovo (online Technical Appendix 
Table). Successive studies confirmed the presence of anti­
bodies against phleboviruses in most parts of the Balkans, 
and recent serologic studies show the circulation of TOSV 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Croatia, and Greece (on­
line Technical Appendix Table).
SFNV Yu 8/76 was the first phlebovirus isolated in the 
Balkans (online Technical Appendix Table). It was isolated 
from P. perfiliewi sand flies; before this finding, other vi­
ruses had been isolated from P. papatasi sand flies, which 
were believed to be the unique vector competent for SFNV 
and SFSV (17). The recent discovery of BALKV should 
stimulate studies to address possible human pathogenicity 
(online Technical Appendix Table). Recent evidence for 
the presence of at least 2 different lineages of TOSV calls 
for studies to measure its involvement in summer menin­
gitis and other neurologic infections, as were performed in 
Italy after the discovery of TOSV neurotropism.
Corfou virus was isolated from P. major sand flies in 
the eponymous Greek island (online Technical Appendix 
Table). Although Corfou/SFSV circulation was assessed 
by seroprevalence studies, Corfou virus remains the only 
SFSV-like virus isolated in the Balkans.
Adria virus was the first member of the Salehabad virus 
complex to be associated with human disease. Because of this 
finding, and in light of the newly discovered viruses within 
this species (BREV and ZABAV), future actions should be 
directed at implementing direct and indirect diagnosis of Sale­
habad phlebovirus species in clinical microbiology laborato­
ries to better understand their potential public health impact.
The fall of communism, the breakup of the former Yu­
goslavia, and the following civil war and other climatic and 
environmental changes resulted in an increase of zoonotic 
infections that emerged or reemerged in the Balkans (28). 
As previously suggested for North Africa and in Turkey, it 
is time to organize systematic testing of patients with CNS 
infections or unexplained febrile illness for such viruses in 
clinical microbiology laboratories in hospitals (35–37). 
In summary, when historical and recent data are com­
piled, it appears that the Balkan region is a hotspot for vi­
ruses transmitted by sand flies, including those that cause 
diseases in humans. The variety of different viruses is 
higher than in other regions that were investigated, and cer­
tain areas display sympatric circulation of several viruses. 
Circulation of these viruses must be assessed by studies 
conducted in human populations and vertebrates, and diag­
nosis of human infections caused by sand fly–borne viruses 
must now be implemented using molecular and serologic 
tools in clinical microbiology laboratories.

We isolated Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative 
agent of melioidosis, from liver granulomas of a pet green 
iguana (Iguana iguana) in Belgium. This case highlights 
a risk for imported green iguanas acting as a reservoir 
for introduction of this high-threat, zoonotic pathogen into 
nonendemic regions.
T
he highly pathogenic, gram-negative bacterium Burk­
holderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioi­
dosis, which is endemic to countries in Southeast Asia and in 
northern Australia and an emerging infectious disease in sev­
eral tropical developing countries (1,2). Human cases in Eu­
rope are limited to patients who traveled to disease-endemic 
regions. In Belgium, the last case was documented in 2013 
in a 44-year-old man who had traveled to Madagascar (3). 
B. pseudomallei is classified as a tier 1 overlap select agent 
by the US Federal Select Agent Program (4). Postexposure 
prophylaxis and postexposure monitoring should be planned 
for persons who have had high-risk exposures, such as cer­
tain laboratory procedures with the organism that were not 
conducted under Biosafety Level 3 conditions (5).
Infected humans and importing of infected animals can 
introduce melioidosis into nonendemic areas (2,6). Howev­
er, importing of infected animals has not yet been associat­
ed with epizootic transmission. Infection commonly occurs 
through cutaneous inoculation, ingestion of contaminated 
soil or water, or inhalation of aerosolized bacteria (7,8). Al­
though the incubation period in humans is typically 1–21 
days, clinical disease might develop years after infection 
(9). The incubation period in naturally infected animals is 
not known (10).
Acute melioidosis results predominantly in pneumo­
nia and septicemia. Chronic infection is associated with 
abscesses of the liver, lungs, spleen, and skin (9). Because 
of the intrinsic resistance of the bacterium to many anti­
microbial drugs, combined with the inability to provide 
appropriate medical care in disease-endemic developing 
countries, overall case-fatality rates might exceed 70% 
(1,4,9). B. pseudomallei is rarely reported in animals other 
than cattle, goats, and swine (10).
In reptiles, isolation of B. pseudomallei has been anec­
dotally documented in crocodiles (10), and clinical infec­
tions have been reported in 2 pet green iguanas in Cali­
fornia, USA (11) and a pet green iguana in Prague (Czech 
Republic) (4). Dermal abscesses were observed in the igua­
na from the Czech Republic and in 1 of the iguanas from 
California, and hepatic masses were observed in the second 
iguana from California.
Because of the variable clinical manifestations of 
melioidosis and limited value of conventional bacterial 
methods for identification of B. pseudomallei, diagnosis of 
melioidosis can be challenging (2,11). If one considers the 
highly pathogenic and zoonotic nature of B. pseudomallei, 
use of appropriate molecular detection methods is crucial 
to warrant correct identification and discrimination of B. 
pseudomallei from other Burkholderia species (11). Next-
generation sequencing might be a valuable supplement to 
current identification and diagnostic methods.
The Study
A 5-year-old female green iguana (Iguana iguana) showed 
acute onset of lethargy, anorexia, and general weakness. 
The iguana had been purchased 4.5 years earlier by private 
owners from a pet shop in the Netherlands that imported 
the iguana from a captive breeding operation in Central 
America. Serum biochemical and hematologic tests showed 
hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, an increased level of 
aspartate aminotransferase, hyperglobulinemia, nonregen­
erative anemia, and severe leukocytosis in comparison 
with physiologic reference ranges for these conditions (12). 
Ultrasonography showed hepatomegaly, multiple hyper­
echoic hepatic masses, and severely enlarged, hyperechoic 
kidneys. A presumptive diagnosis of hepatitis, kidney fail­
ure, and septicemia was made. Because the iguana did not 
respond to supportive treatment and its general condition 
continued to deteriorate, the owners agreed to euthanize the 
iguana on the fifth day after signs began.
During necropsy, pronounced renomegaly and hepato­
megaly, as well as granulomatous hepatitis was observed.

sections of liver showed coalescent granulomas throughout 
the liver parenchyma, with central necrosis surrounded by ac­
tivated macrophages and giant cells (Figure). Gram, periodic 
acid–Schiff, and acid-fast staining did not show intralesional 
gram-positive or acid-fast bacteria or fungi. Microbiological 
examination of liver tissue yielded a pure and abundant cul­
ture of small colonies of gram-negative rods that could not be 
identified by using standard biochemical identification tests.
Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate 
showed 100% identity with B. pseudomallei (1,382 bp). 
Sequence data were deposited in GenBank under acces­
sion no. MF523223. After culturing of the isolate under 
Biosafety Level 3 conditions, we performed multilocus 
sequence typing–derived PCR and real-time PCR as de­
scribed by Wattiau et al. (13), which confirmed identifica­
tion of the isolate as B. pseudomallei.
We used next-generation sequencing to obtain the ge­
nome sequence of the isolate, which was deposited in the 
Short Read Archive under accession no. SRR6056996. 
The genome sequence was used to infer its multilocus se­
quence type (ST) as ST518. Isolate information was depos­
ited accordingly in the B. pseudomallei database (https://
pubMLST.org) under ID 5121 (14). Of 5,600 deposited 
isolates that we accessed on June 18, 2018, ST518 matched 
only with B. pseudomallei isolates (ID 3330) obtained from 
a human who was infected in Costa Rica in 2009 (ID 1928) 
(14) and with 2 isolates obtained from abscesses in pet igua­
nas in 2007 (ID 5008) and 2012 (ID 3330) (11). We found 
that ID 3330 differed from the isolates from Central Amer­
ica by only 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which 
strongly suggested that the iguanas were infected in Central 
America before transport abroad (15). However, whether 
captive iguanas might acquire infections through contact 
with other imported animals (e.g., in pet shops or in captive 
collections in nonendemic countries) cannot be excluded.
After we identified the isolate as B. pseudomallei, we 
collected 100 mL of water from a plastic water bath and a 
swab specimen from the emptied water reservoir from the 
housing of the iguana and tested these samples by using 
real-time PCR. All samples showed negative results.
The zoonotic potential of the bacterium was dis­
cussed with the owners and personnel who came into con­
tact with the iguana or samples that were collected from 
the lizard. Although the owners did not have a clinical 
history that could indicate B. pseudomallei infection, they 
were advised to consult with their physicians about poten­
tial exposure. Although the owners refused postexposure 
prophylaxis and postexposure monitoring, postexposure 
prophylaxis was given to a selected number of staff mem­
bers as recommended by Lipsitz et al. (5) because of po­
tential exposure to the pathogen.
Conclusions
Previously reported B. pseudomallei–infected iguanas (4,11) 
and the 1 reported in this study were presumably imported 
from disease-endemic regions, highlighting the potential 
role of this species as a reservoir of B. pseudomallei. On the 
basis of the relatedness of ST518 with an isolate obtained 
from a human in Costa Rica (14) and with 2 isolates from 
iguanas that presumably became infected in Central America 
(11), whose genomes were later confirmed to be closely re­
lated (15), our findings support the hypothesis that the iguana 
we report became infected in the captive breeding facility in 
Central America before importation to Europe.
If one considers the long incubation period observed 
for green iguanas, these reptiles might shed the bacterium 
unnoticed for years before nonspecific chronic disease 
develops. Transmission from infected captive iguanas to 
humans might occur through contact with stool, infected 
tissue, or biting and scratching lesions. Indirect infection 
might originate from wound infection through contaminat­
ed soil or water or inhalation of aerosolized bacteria.
In conclusion, traders, (para)veterinarians, and labora­
tory staff members who handle green iguanas or samples 
obtained from this species are susceptible to infection. In 
addition, physicians who are consulted by pet green iguana 
owners should be aware that these animals and their envi­
ronment could potentially harbor B. pseudomallei.

Eradication of small ruminant morbillivirus (PPRV) is target­
ed for 2030. PPRV lineage IV is found in much of Asia and 
Africa. We used PPRV lineage IV strain Kurdistan/2011 in 
transmission trials to investigate the role of pigs, wild boar, 
and small ruminants as PPRV reservoirs. Suids were a pos­
sible source of infection.
P
este des petits ruminants is one of the most serious 
(economically and clinically) transboundary animal 
diseases (1–3). Of 4 lineages, small ruminant morbilli­
virus (previously called peste des petits ruminants virus; 
PPRV) lineage IV (PPRV-LIV) has spread the most widely 
in the past decade, particularly in Asia, and increasingly 
dominates the PPRV lineages in Africa (2,4). Morbidity 
and mortality rates for goats are high, up to 100%; how­
ever, sheep can be subclinically infected and play a ma­
jor role in the silent spread of PPRV over large distances 
and across borders (3). The role of other wild and domestic 
Artiodactyls in the epidemiology of PPRV is unknown or 
insufficiently understood (3). Pigs are considered dead-end 
hosts for PPRV (5). In an experimental infection study, pigs 
infected with PPRV lineage II (LII) strains did not trans­
mit PPRV to goats, but they can transmit the closely re­
lated Rinderpest morbillivirus to cattle (6). To determine 
the pathogenesis of PPRV-LIV infection in pigs and wild 
boar and the capability of these suids to transmit PPRV in 
comparison with that of goats and sheep, we conducted 4 
independent transmission trials during 2015–2016. The ex­
perimental protocol was reviewed by a state ethics com­

The Study
In 4 trials (trials 1–4; Table), we intranasally inoculated 
suids with a recent PPRV-LIV strain (Kurdistan/2011 
[7,8]). Contact control animals were added 2 days later. 
We recorded clinical signs and temperature regularly and 
collected samples to evaluate the suitability of different 
virologic, serologic, and pathological methods for detect­
ing PPRV infection. We conducted statistical analyses to 
calculate whether PPRV RNA loads in secretions and ex­
cretions (oral, nasal, and fecal swab samples) collected 
over time from pigs, wild boar, goats, and sheep differed 
significantly and to determine correlations between the 
results of virus isolation and PCR assays by using swab 
samples and purified leukocytes as sample materials (on­
line Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/12/18-0507- Techapp1.pdf).
As expected, goats showed the typical moderate to 
severe clinical signs (trials 1 and 3) reported previously 
(7–9). Clinical signs in PPRV-infected sheep (trial 4) were 
generally mild to moderate, as previously described (3,8). 
Contact controls showed similar clinical signs. One PPRV-
infected sheep showed severe clinical signs similar to those 
of the goats. Surprisingly, all PPRV infected pigs and wild 
boar (trials 1–3) showed various mild to moderate clinical 
signs, including fever and reduced general condition (all 
suids), diarrhea (pig 1, boar 1–4), and ocular (pigs 1–3) and 
nasal (boar 4) discharge typical for PPRV infection (Fig­
ure 1; Figure 2, panels A–C; online Technical Appendix). 
PPRV-induced immunosuppression may predispose af­
fected animals to secondary infections (3,9) as reflected by 
distinct severe leukocytopenia in pigs and goats a few days 
after inoculation. Different expressions of clinical signs af­
ter PPRV infection might have been caused by concurrent 
infections with other pathogens or differences in individual 
resistance to PPRV infection (9). In the 4 wild boar, for 
example, Balantidium coli, detected by histopathologic ex­
amination (data not shown), might have been an additional 
factor causing the diarrhea (10). Nevertheless, similar to 
the lack of clinical signs reported for pigs infected with a 
PPRV-LII strain (6), the 2 pigs in trial 3 showed only mild 
clinical signs.
Contact transmission of PPRV from intranasally in­
fected pigs to 1 contact goat and 1 pig was noted (trial 
1). This pig was refractory to intranasal infection but was 
infected by contact at a similar time as one of the goats. 
Furthermore, PPRV was transmitted from intranasally 
infected goats to contact pigs (trial 3) (Table). Hence, in 
contrast to the findings of Nawathe and Taylor (6), who 
reported contact transmission of a PPRV-LII strain from 
experimentally infected goats to contact pigs but not vice 
versa, our transmission trials demonstrated that a complete 
interspecies transmission cycle of a PPRV-LIV strain be­
tween goats and pigs, and possibly also intraspecies trans­
mission between pigs, can be maintained. The virulence of

the PPRV lineage or strain is possibly a factor influencing 
the susceptibility to PPRV infection and the probability of 
PPRV transmission (9,11).
From 2 of 4 wild boar (trial 2), PPRV was isolated 
from a few fecal swab samples but was not transmitted to 
the contact goats or pigs. Unexpectedly, none of the in­
tranasally infected sheep transmitted PPRV to any of the 
contact sheep. The considerable differences in transmis­
sion efficiency between goats and the other Artiodactyls 
can be explained by higher PPRV loads excreted by goats 
(Figure 1). Statistically significantly higher PPRV RNA 
loads over time were found in PPRV-infected goats than 
in suids and sheep. Peak viral loads in goat samples were 
up to 1 log step (PCR) and 2.5 log steps (virus isolation) 
higher (9.3 × 107 copies/mL; 106.0 TCID50 [50% tissue cul­
ture infective dose]/mL) than in pig and wild boar samples 
(1.5 × 107 copies/mL; 103.5 TCID50/mL). Of note, peak 
viral loads in sheep (104 TCID50/mL) were only slightly 
higher than those in pigs and wild boar, which may explain 
why none of the sheep transmitted PPRV to the contact

†For trials 1–3, animals were experimentally infected by intranasal inoculation with PPRV strain Kurdistan/2011 for independent transmission trials 
conducted in the containment facility of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Isle of Riems, Germany. Contact control animals were added 2 d after experimental 
infection. In 2 of the trials, PPRV transmission was documented from pigs to 1 goat and 1 pig (trial 1) and from goats to 2 pigs (trial 3). Infectious PPRV 
excretion was detected in >1 animal of each species, and PPRV RNA and seroconversion were detected in all experimentally infected or contact-infected 
animals (further details in online Technical Appendix Figure 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0507-Techapp1.pdf). For trial 4, a 1-to-1 
(pairwise) study design was chosen to estimate the reproductive ratio. The results of the sheep trial are presented in this study to enable comprehensive 
comparison with the PPRV pathogenesis in suids. 
‡One of 3 pigs was probably not infected by experimental intranasal PPRV inoculation but by contact infection.  
§One contact goat was infected by pigs; however the source of infection (goat or pig) cannot be determined for the second contact goat. 
¶In each of 5 stables, 2 sheep were kept together: 1 experimentally infected sheep and 1 contact control sheep.

control sheep. The higher viral loads in goats could also 
explain the ≈4 days earlier contact infection of the contact 
pigs in trial 3 than the contact goat and pig in trial 1. Be­
sides a higher innate susceptibility to PPRV infection ob­
served for goats compared with sheep and suids, the infec­
tive dose may play a role in the efficiency of transmission 
and infection dynamics of PPRV in suids as previously 
reported for goats (9) and camelids (12).
We detected seroconversion in all PPRV-infected 
animals by using competitive ELISA and neutralization 
tests. Neutralizing antibody titers were moderate to high 
in suids and goats (2.16–2.96 log10 ND50 [virus neutral­
ization in 50% of replicates]) and slightly lower in sheep 
(1.76–2.56 log10 ND50). After seroconversion, no PPRV 
could be isolated from swab and purified leukocyte sam­
ples, but PPRV RNA was detected in swab samples for at 
least 3–4 weeks after infection in all species, with indi­
vidual differences (Figure 1; online Technical Appendix). 
Correlation analyses revealed a poor to excellent correla­
tion of PCR and virus isolation results before seroconver­
sion, depending on the animal species. Possible reasons 
for (transient) PPRV RNA persistence are infection of 
neurons followed by transsynaptic spread (13). Indeed, 
PPRV RNA was detected in single or multiple brain sam­
ples of 2 sheep, 4 goats, and in the choroid plexus of 1 pig, 
1 wild boar, and 3 goats. PPRV RNA in the choroid plexus 
might have been associated with PPRV-infected immune 
cells, as has been reported for ferrets infected with closely 
related canine morbillivirus (14). Immunohistochemistry 
demonstrated that PPRV antigens in other tissues were 
often associated with immune cells. For PPRV diagno­
sis in the examined species, tissue of the lymphoreticular 
system, in particular tonsils (Figure 2, panel D), head and 
lung–associated lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, 
and small intestinal Peyer’s patches, were found most 
suitable for postmortem diagnosis with PCR and immu­
nohistochemistry. PCR was the most sensitive virologic 
method independent from the sample material, and com­
petitive ELISA proved reliable for serologic PPRV diag­
nosis (online Technical Appendix).
Conclusions
Transmission trials with a virulent PPRV-LIV strain re­
vealed that suids are an unexpected possible source for 
PPRV infection. Therefore, domestic pigs and wild boar 
should be considered as possible PPRV reservoir hosts. 
This finding is especially relevant to stringent control pro­
grams. The epidemiologic role of suids in the spread of 
PPRV, as maintenance or spillover hosts (15), should be 
further investigated in field and experimental studies using 
different PPRV lineages and strains at different environ­
mental and experimental conditions.

To determine their potential role as a source of human infec­
tion, we tested domestic dogs (urban) and wild coatis (wild) 
in Brazil for vaccinia virus. Our findings of positive neutraliz­
ing antibodies and quantitative PCR results for 35/184 dogs 
and 13/90 coatis highlight a potential public health risk. 
S
ince smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, after a 
massive effort led by the World Health Organization, 
other orthopoxviruses have gained notoriety as zoonotic 
agents worldwide (1). Over the past 17 years in Brazil, 
many zoonotic outbreaks of vaccinia virus (VACV) infec­
tion have been recorded throughout the country, becoming 
a burden for the dairy industry and public health (2). The 
most affected hosts during outbreaks are dairy cattle and 
humans (2). Recent studies assessing the role of wildlife 
in the maintenance cycle of VACV in nature have corrobo­
rated previous findings that rodents and marsupials serve 
as links between natural and anthropic environments (2–4).
Indeed, the increased frequency of reported VACV de­
tection in several species of mammals points toward new 
insights into the circulation and maintenance of VACV in 
wild (forest) and rural (farm) environments (2,5–8). Stud­
ies conducted in Latin America suggest that wildlife, espe­
cially small and medium-sized mammals, plays a role in 
virus transmission and maintenance of orthopoxviruses in 
nature (9). Furthermore, some studies have shown the pres­
ence of VACV in urban environments, emphasizing the 
risks for humans (especially those not vaccinated against 
smallpox) (10,11).
To determine the potential role of domestic and wild 
animals as a source of VACV infection for humans, we 
investigated VACV circulation among domestic dogs and 
wild coatis, animals that live at the intersection of urban 
and wild environments in Brazil. The capture of wild ani­
mals was authorized by the Brazilian Institute of Environ­
ment and Renewable Natural Resources, and the study was 
approved by the Ethics Committee in Animal Experimenta­
tion of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.
The Study
We analyzed serum and anal swab samples collected dur­
ing 2013–2015 from 184 domestic dogs and 90 wild coatis 
in the city of Belo Horizonte (19°55′15′′S, 43°56′16′′W) in 
the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (Figure 1). Swab samples 
of lesions, if present, were also collected. To determine the 
presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum, we used an 
orthopoxvirus plaque reduction neutralization test as previ­
ously described (12). Serum titers were defined as the high­
est dilutions that inhibited >70% of virus plaques compared 
with negative controls.
To detect VACV DNA from serum and anal swab 
samples, we performed real-time PCR targeting the C11R 
or A56R gene (12). We directly sequenced A56R fragments 
in both orientations and in triplicate by using the ABI3130 
platform (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). Se­
quences were aligned with other reference sequences from 
GenBank by using MEGA 7.0 (http://www.megasoftware.
net). Statistical analyses were conducted by using Epi Info 
software version 7.2.1.0 (https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo); 
χ2 and Fisher exact tests were applied with significance 
set at 5%. We also calculated relative odds ratios (ORs) 
and 95% CIs.
We detected orthopoxvirus neutralizing antibodies in 
35 dogs (prevalence rate 19.0%, 95% CI 14.0%–25.5%; ti­
ters 100–400 neutralizing units/mL) and in 13 coatis (prev­
alence rate 14.4%, 95% CI 8.5%–23.3%; titers 100–800 
neutralizing units/mL) (Table 1). Univariate analyses indi­
cated significant associations between presence of neutral­
izing antibodies and the following: male dogs (OR 2.6; p 
= 0.02), dogs 6–10 years of age (OR 5.2; p = 0.04), coatis 
captured in 2013 (OR 11.2; p = 0.002), juvenile coatis (<1 
y of age) (OR 35; p = 0.001), and adult coatis (>2 y of age) 
(OR 5.1; p = 0.04).
Samples from all seropositive animals were submitted 
for quantitative PCR (qPCR) to detect VACV DNA (Table

2). Overall, serum samples from 7 dogs and 6 coatis were 
positive for the C11R gene; of these, anal swab samples 
were positive for this gene for 3 dogs and 4 coatis. Samples 
from the C11R-positive animals were submitted for an­
other qPCR targeting the A56R gene. Serum samples were 
positive for the A56R gene for 5 dogs and 4 coatis; of these, 
anal swab samples were positive for A56R for 1 dog and 3 
coatis. No lesion swab samples were positive by qPCR for 
both C11R and A56R genes.
Alignment of the amplified A56R fragments showed 
high similarity to the homologous gene of VACV isolates 
from Brazil (online Technical Appendix Figure, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/17-1584-Techapp1.
pdf). Furthermore, 5 sequenced samples (from 4 dogs and 
1 coatis) showed an 18-nt signature deletion, which is 
present in sequences of mouse nonvirulent VACV strains 
from Brazil (group 1 VACV). This deletion was not 
present in samples from 4 animals (1 dog and 3 coatis), 
grouping with mouse virulent VACV strains from Brazil 
(group 2 VACV).
Conclusions
We assessed VACV exposure of 2 interacting species of 
animal: domestic dogs from an urban area and coatis from 
a bordering wild area. In contrast to VACV infections, 
human cowpox virus infections have mostly occurred in 
urban areas of Europe. Cowpox virus is transmitted to hu­
mans mainly by domestic cats that are in contact with ro­
dents, the natural cowpox virus reservoirs (13). However, 
some authors have hypothesized that domestic dogs could 
be implicated in the transmission cycle of VACV, acting as 
a link between the natural reservoirs and humans in urban 
environments (14,15). Indeed, our molecular findings sup­
port exposure and possible VACV infection of these ani­
mals, thereby indicating that they are a potential source of 
VACV exposure for humans in urban areas. 
The seroprevalence of orthopoxvirus neutralizing an­
tibodies in dogs in Brazil has been described. Peres et al. 
found that, along with other farm animals, 22.8% of 114 
dogs tested were seropositive for orthopoxviruses (7); this 
seroprevalence differs from that observed in our study, 
which was 3.8% lower. In addition, most animals tested by 
Peres et al. were from rural areas where no bovine vaccinia 
outbreaks had been officially reported, and 96% of farm­
ers declared that their domestic animals have contact with 
wild animals (9). These findings indicate that dogs could 
be exposed to VACV through contact with wild animals, 
corroborating our hypothesis.
We also detected orthopoxvirus neutralizing antibod­
ies in wild coatis, which is consistent with results of a

tion of VACV DNA in anal swab samples from coatis 
indicate that these animals could act as a source of virus 
for domestic dogs and humans and serve as a link between 
wild and urban environments. However, future studies to 
determine if viable virus is shed are needed to confirm 
this possibility.

Vaccinia Virus among Dogs and Coatis, Brazil
To impart information about the role of domestic ani­
mals and wildlife in the natural cycle of VACV, we de­
veloped a hypothetical model based on previous studies 
(2,3,5), which could illustrate the dynamics of VACV cir­
culation in urban areas (Figure 2). Because coatis can cir­
culate in wild environments and surrounding urban areas, 
they could act as a bridge promoting the transmission of 
VACV between wild animals (mainly rodents) and dogs 
or humans. Domestic dogs could transmit VACV directly 
to humans through close contact or indirectly thought con­
taminated feces (Figure 2). These data raise questions about 
VACV circulation in Brazil and open discussions about the 
role of dogs and coatis in the VACV epidemiologic cycle.

Figure 2. A hypothetical model developed to visualize the role of domestic animals and wildlife in the natural cycle of vaccinia 
virus (VACV). The model illustrates the dynamics of VACV circulation in urban and wild areas of Brazil. In urban areas, wild coatis 
could promote the transmission of VACV between domestic animals or humans because they are in direct contact with domestic 
dogs and circulate among urban residences. Domestic dogs could also promote the transmission of VACV to humans because 
of direct contact or possibly indirect contact thought contaminated feces. In the wild environment, coatis can interact with other 
mammals such as wild rodents, which are believed to be VACV reservoirs, and acquire the infection (this potential interaction is 
still under investigation).

In December 2016, highly pathogenic avian influenza 
(HPAI) infection with systemic pathologic lesions was found 
in cats in South Korea. Genetic analyses indicated that the 
feline isolates were similar to HPAI H5N6 viruses isolated 
in chicken farms nearby. This finding highlights the need for 
monitoring of domestic mammals during HPAI outbreaks.
H
ighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6 has 
spread across Asia, Europe, and Africa. Since a novel 
influenza A(H5N6) virus emerged in China in late 2013 (1), 
H5N6 viruses have been subsequently reported in South­
east Asia. In China, HPAI A(H5N6) virus caused the earli­
est reported human infection in 2014 and became one of 
the dominant subtypes in poultry farms and live poultry 
markets (2). These viruses caused a potential threat to other 
mammals, including pigs and cats (3,4). We report H5N6 
virus infection in cats during 2016–17 HPAI outbreaks in 
domestic poultry in South Korea (5).
The Study
The 2016–17 winter season saw epidemics of HPAI 
A(H5N6) in domestic poultry and wild birds in South 
Korea (5). At the end of December 2016, three carcasses 
of cats were submitted from areas near H5N6 virus–in­
fected chicken farms in Pocheon. The cats had shown 
sudden clinical signs of salivation, lethargy, convulsion, 
and bloody discharge around the mouth and jaws and 
died within 4 days after illness onset despite antimicrobial 
drug treatment. After necropsy, we processed representa­
tive tissues for histopathology and immunohistochemis­
try (online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/
EID/article/24/12/18-0290-Techapp1.pdf). The necropsy 
findings included bloody nasal discharge (Figure 1, panel 
A), severe pulmonary congestion and edema, and white-
colored foci in the liver (Figure 1, panel B). The lungs were 
red and yellow in color and incompletely collapsed and had 
accumulated a small amount of frothy fluid. The spleen was 
enlarged 2-fold. The pancreas showed spotty hemorrhage 
and white pinpoint foci.
Histopathologic examination revealed severe lesions 
in brain, lungs, and liver in the examined cats. We observed 
necrosis and loss of neurons, lymphocytic perivascular 
cuffing, and gliosis (Figure 1, panel C) in the cerebellum 
and cerebrum, and especially severe necrosis in the hip­
pocampus. The lungs showed marked congestion, edema, 
hemorrhage, and severe interstitial pneumonia (Figure 1, 
panel D), and thrombus in the alveolar capillaries. The liver 
showed severe necrotic foci and hepatitis. We observed in­
fluenza viral antigen in neurons (Figure 1, panel E), glial 
cells, and alveolar macrophages (Figure 1, panel F). Table 
1 describes histopathologic lesions and Table 2 immuno­
histochemical reactivity.
We recognized H5N6 virus infection in a domestic 
male cat (cat 1) and juvenile outdoor cats (cats 2 and 3). 
We observed necrotic lesions and influenza viral antigens 
in multiple visceral organs, suggesting that the virus caused 
systemic infection. It seems likely that the neurotropism of 
H5N6 virus was a key factor contributing to the sudden 
death of these cats. The results of this study are consistent 
with those of other studies of HPAI pathogenicity in ex­
perimentally infected dogs (6,7).
The histopathologic findings and the localization of 
H5N6 virus antigen to the lungs and liver, but not to the 
brain, in cats have been reported (8). In this case, we ob­
served meningoencephalitis. Moreover, the 3 cats showed 
neurologic symptoms such as salivation and convulsion, 
which may be related to necrosis and loss of neurons. The 
severity of the lesions was consistent with the number of 
cells that reacted with influenza viral antigen. A few studies 
reported that H9 and H10 influenza viruses were nephro­
tropic in chickens with low pathogenicity (9,10) and that 
HPAI H5 virus causes acute renal lesions in mammals and 
primates, including humans (11). The results of our study 
suggest that the HPAI H5N6 virus affects cats differently 
than do other HPAI viruses; therefore, further studies are 
needed to experimentally infect cats with other HPAI H5 
subtypes, including the isolate from this study, for com­
plete clarification.
Previous studies have shown that avian viruses pref­
erentially recognize α-2,3 linkage (SA α 2,3Gal) and bind 
to type II alveolar cells, which are abundant in the lower

A/feline/Korea/H646-1/2016(H5N6) from the domestic 
male cat and A/feline/Korea/H646-2/2016(H5N6) from 
1 juvenile outdoor cat. We performed virus isolation, se­
quencing, and phylogenetic analysis as described (online 
Technical Appendix). Phylogenetic analyses showed 
that the H5 genes of the cat isolates belonged to clade 
2.3.4.4.C and were very closely related to H5N6 viruses 
detected in poultry in areas within a radius of 1 km of the 
cats’ location (Figure 2, panel A). In a previous study, 
clade 2.3.4.4.C H5N6 viruses from the 2016–17 epi­
demic in South Korea were divided into 5 distinct geno­
groups (C-1 to C-5) (5). The feline isolates showed high 
similarity with H5N6 viruses in genogroup C-4, which 
was detected in domestic poultry nearby during 2016–17 
HPAI A(H5N6) outbreaks (Figure 2; online Technical 
Appendix Figure).
Epidemiologic studies show that the cats might be in­
fected by feeding on or by contact with infected wild birds, 
although the virus was not isolated from wild birds around 
this area. The affected domestic cat lived in a house near 
a small stream where migratory birds were observed and 
a wide main road. Across the main road, H5N6 virus–af­
fected chicken farms were located within 1 km. In previous 
reports, cats and tigers were naturally infected by feeding 
on infected bird carcasses (8,14). In China, H5N6 virus in­
fection in cats has been reported in regions such as Suchuan 
and Guangdong Provinces (3).
We compared each gene of the feline and chicken 
H5N6 isolates (online Technical Appendix Table). The 
hemagglutinin (HA) genes of the viruses contained mul­
tiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site 
(PLRERRRKR). The amino acid residues on the recep­
tor binding sites of the HA gene of H5N6 viruses were 
Q226 and G228 (H3 numbering), indicating an avian-
like (α2,3-SA) receptor-binding preference. T160A mu­
tation in the HA gene suggested a possible increased 
viral affinity for human-like (α2,6-SA) receptor binding, 
shown in feline isolates. The neuraminidase genes of fe­
line isolates also had 11 aa deletions at positions 59–69, 
which were often observed in avian influenza virus lin­
eages adapted to poultry and may increase the virulence 
to mammals (2). We did not observe amino acid substi­
tution at position E627K of the polybasic 2 gene in the 
feline isolates.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that cats can be directly infected 
by HPAI H5N6 virus. Cats are companion animals and 
may act as a vector for influenza transmission to hu­
mans. Despite the low probability of H5N6 virus infec­
tion in companion animals, avian influenza surveillance 
will be needed for mammals, including cats, during 
H5N6 outbreaks.

During 2004–2011, we collected green lizards and Ixodes 
ricinus ticks in Slovak Karst National Park in Slovakia; 
90% (36/40) of lizards and 37% of ticks removed from 
lizards were infected with family Anaplasmataceae bac­
teria. Only Candidatus Cryptoplasma sp. REP (reptile) 
was identified in these samples. Green lizards transmit 
this bacterium.
T
he family Anaplasmataceae (Rickettsiales; Alphapro­
teobacteria) comprises bacteria that are able to invade 
and infect their vertebrate host’s blood cells, bone mar­
row–derived phagocytic cells, and endothelial cells; these 
bacteria can also infect cells of insects, helminths, and 
arthropod reproductive tissues (1–3). Tickborne family 
members include bacteria of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Can­
didatus Neoehrlichia sp., and Candidatus Cryptoplasma 
californiense (4).
Although reptiles play a role as hosts for ixodid and 
argasid ticks, their role in maintaining tickborne Anaplas­
mataceae bacteria in the environment has not been de­
scribed. Nieto et al. (5) suggested that lizards and snakes 
in the far western part of the United States could become 
exposed to Anaplasma phagocytophilum when fed on by 
infected ticks. Moreover, Rejmanek et al. detected 2 highly 
dissimilar strains of A. phagocytophilum in the same lizard 
species (6). In Europe, an undescribed Anaplasma sp. was 
detected in Ixodes ricinus ticks feeding on sand lizards and 
sand lizard blood samples (7,8). In our study, we sought 
to confirm these previous findings by determining whether 
family Anaplasmataceae bacteria were present in lizards 
and their feeding ticks in Slovakia.
The Study
We conducted this study in the Slovak Karst National Park 
in Slovakia (48°36′N, 20°52′E) during 2004–2011. We 
carried out lizard capture and sample collections with offi­
cial permits (6103/2007-2.1 and 5498/2011-2.2) issued by 
the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic. We 
captured 103 green lizards (Lacerta viridis) and collected 
blood from 40 (30 males and 10 females). We collected 
235 I. ricinus ticks (118 larvae and 117 nymphs) from 63 
green lizards and 271 questing I. ricinus ticks (132 nymphs, 
76 males, and 63 females) from the same area and immedi­
ately stored them in 70% ethanol.
We isolated DNA from lizard blood using a DNeasy 
Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden Germany) and iso­
lated DNA from ticks by alkaline hydrolysis. We performed 
PCR amplification in 25-μL (total) reaction mixtures us­
ing the MasterTaq DNA Polymerase Kit (Eppendorf AG, 
Hamburg, Germany). We amplified sequences using the 
primer combinations EHR747 plus EHR521 or fD1 plus 
rP2 (9), which spanned almost the entire 16S rRNA se­
quence (Table 1). We examined the ≈250-bp gene fragment 
of 16S rRNA by single-strand conformation polymorphism 
(SSCP) analysis to determine Anaplasmataceae species 
type (10). We performed SSCP analysis following the pro­
tocol of Derdakova et al. (11). We ran positive control sam­
ples A. phagocytophilum, A. ovis, Wolbachia sp., and Can­
didatus N. mikurensis with each reaction. We purified the 
PCR products obtained using the GenElute PCR Clean-Up 
Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) and sequenced 
both strands. We edited variants obtained in this study 
(1,410 bp) using MEGA 4.0.2 (https://megasoftware.net/) 
and checked by eye. We made comparisons to sequences 
in GenBank with BLASTn 2.2.26 (https://pods.iplantcol­
laborative.org/wiki/display/DEapps/Blastn-2.2.26). 
For 
phylogenetic analysis of our variant (GenBank accession 
no. MG924904), we aligned 17 related sequences obtained 
from the GenBank database and constructed a phylogenetic 
tree using the Bayesian inference method (12).
We examined all blood and ticks collected for the 
presence of family Anaplasmataceae bacteria. Anaplas­
mataceae family members were present in 36 lizards (28 
males and 8 females). Of the ticks removed from lizards, 
87 (37%) were infected, and of questing ticks, 18 (6.6%) 
were infected (Table 2).

Candidatus Cryptoplasma and Lizards and Ticks
Denatured and electrophoresed PCR products from 
samples demonstrated several SSCP profiles, of which 1 
was clearly distinguishable from the profiles of the Ana­
plasmataceae species used as controls (Figure 1). We de­
tected this unique profile in all lizard blood samples, all 
ticks feeding on lizards, and some questing ticks. We se­
quenced representatives of this unidentified SSCP profile 
(≈247 bp; GenBank accession nos. KY031322–3) and com­
pared them with DNA fragments in the GenBank database. 
The closest related (99% identity) 16S rRNA sequences 
were from uncultured Anaplasma sp. isolates from quest­
ing I. ricinus ticks from Morocco (GenBank accession no. 
AY672415), Tunisia (GenBank accession no. AY672420), 
and France (GenBank accession no. GU734325). Sequenc­
ing of a longer (1,410-bp) fragment of the 16S rRNA gene 
revealed 99.1% similarity with the Candidatus C. californi­
ense isolate from I. pacificus ticks in California (Figure 2). 
The 16S rRNA sequence obtained in this study was found 
to share a maximum of 94% identity with A. phagocytophi­
lum Norway variant 2 (GenBank accession no. CP015376). 
The phylogenetic tree we constructed using 16S rRNA 
gene sequences showed that the reptile-associated Candi­
datus Cryptoplasma sp. REP (reptile) clustered in a sepa­
rate branch with Candidatus C. californiense, indicating 
the isolate represents a lineage distinct from other known 
Anaplasmataceae species (e.g., A. phagocytophilum, A. 
marginale, A. platys, Ehrlichia muris, E. chaffeensis, and 
E. ewingii).
Conclusions
The role of ectotherm animals, especially lizards, in the 
maintenance of vectorborne pathogens is not clear. The 
interaction between reptiles and Anaplasmataceae fam­
ily members has only been investigated in a few studies. 
Our findings expand knowledge on this research topic. 
Only limited information about the reptile–Anaplasma 
relationship exists. Ekner et al. suggested that sand liz­
ards could potentially serve as a reservoir host for spe­
cies of the Anaplasmataceae family when she discovered 
that ticks collected from these lizards in Poland were in­
fected with Anaplasma-like pathogens (8). Although A. 
phagocytophilum might be transmitted by reptiles to a 
limited extent (5), the Anaplasma-like species detected 
in reptiles could also be a novel species, as suggested by 
Rejmanek et al. (6).
Despite the fact that lizards are exposed to a number 
of family Anaplasmataceae bacteria through infected ticks, 
our findings suggest that, except for Canditatus Crypto­
plasma sp. REP, green lizards do not acquire infections 
with these species. In short, we detected Canditatus Cryp­
toplasma sp. REP in 90% of examined lizards, 37% of ticks 
feeding on lizards, and 6.6% of questing ticks in localities 
with lizards.
On the basis of our results, we cautiously speculate 
that Canditatus Cryptoplasma sp. REP is selected for and 
other genospecies selected against in ticks feeding on liz­
ards. The Canditatus Cryptoplasma sp. REP variant had a 
high homology (100%) with a sequence obtained from an 
Apodemus agrarius mouse from Slovakia (13), which in­
dicates that rodents or other mammals might also become 
infected with this bacterium and contribute (to a lesser ex­
tent) to the circulation of these bacteria in nature.
In conclusion, we found a yet to be named species of 
Canditatus Cryptoplasma sp. (Canditatus Cryptoplasma sp.

REP) in questing I. ricinus ticks, I. ricinus ticks collected 
from and feeding on green lizards, and the blood of green 
lizards in Slovakia. These results indicate that green lizards 
serve as an intermediate host for this bacterium and that liz­
ards can influence the enzootic maintenance and circulation 
of bacteria in the environment. However, other hosts besides 
reptiles could be involved in the Canditatus Cryptoplasma 
sp. REP lifecycle as well, though probably to a lesser extent.

EID SPOTLIGHT TOPIC 
TICKS
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/
page/tick-spotlight
Ticks transmit a variety of different 
pathogens, including bacteria, protozoa, 
and viruses, which can produce serious 
and even fatal disease in humans and 
animals. Tens of thousands of cases of 
tickborne disease are reported each year, 
including Lyme disease. 
Lyme disease is the most well-known 
tickborne disease. However, other tick­
borne illnesses such as Rocky Mountain 
spotted fever, tularemia, babesiosis, and 
ehrlichiosis also contribute to severe 
morbidity and more mortality each year.

During 2014–2015, a total of 31 deaths were associated 
with the first chikungunya epidemic in Puerto Rico. We ana­
lyzed excess mortality from various causes for the same 
months during the previous 4 years and detected 1,310 
deaths possibly attributable to chikungunya. Our findings 
raise important questions about increased mortality rates 
associated with chikungunya.
I
n December 2013, the first locally acquired chikungunya 
virus infections in the Americas were reported in Saint 
Martin. Since that report, the virus has spread to 45 coun­
tries and territories in North, Central, and South America, 
causing ≈2.4 million suspected and confirmed cases and 
440 deaths through December 2016 (1).
Chikungunya has emerged worldwide since 2004. 
Several gaps in knowledge exist about the disease and its 
consequences. Until recently chikungunya was considered 
a nonlethal disease, but severe forms and deaths have been 
described since an epidemic on Réunion Island during 
2005–2006 (2).
In Puerto Rico, the chikungunya epidemic began in 
May 2014 as the first occurrence of the virus in the coun­
try (3). Official surveillance reported 28,327 suspected 
chikungunya cases, of which 4,339 were laboratory-
confirmed; 31 persons died (0.9 deaths/100,000 popula­
tion). The chikungunya mortality rate was significantly 
lower than that observed in epidemics on other islands, 
such as Réunion Island (25.9 deaths/100,000 population 
in 2006), Martinique (20.5/100,000 population in 2014), 
and Guadaloupe (14.4/100,000 population in 2014) (1,4). 
These differences could be a consequence of the diffi­
culty of recognizing the etiology of severe clinical forms 
and deaths.
The Study
We studied excess mortality associated with chikungunya 
in Puerto Rico by comparing monthly expected deaths and 
actual deaths during the epidemic (5–7). We calculated ex­
pected deaths by the average age-adjusted mortality rate 
for each month for 2010 to 2013 and projected them to the 
estimated population for 2014 and 2015 (6). We considered 
the difference between observed and expected deaths for 
the months in which observed deaths exceeded the upper 
limit of the 99% CI (6) as excess deaths associated with the 
chikungunya epidemic (Figure 1).
We estimated the mortality rate expected for the sec­
ond half of 2014, the worst period of the epidemic, and 
compared it with the observed mortality rate. This second 
group of calculations was based on the all-cause age-spe­
cific mortality rate for the 10 leading causes of death in 
Puerto Rico and main causes of deaths associated with se­
vere chikungunya in Réunion Island (2).
We obtained data on estimated population from the 
US Census Bureau (8) and on deaths from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for 
Health Statistics (9). In mid-September 2014, Puerto Rico 
issued an official administrative order stating that only 
persons hospitalized with suspected chikungunya should 
be reported to health authorities in Puerto Rico (3), Thus, 
we monitored the occurrence of chikungunya, dengue, and 
other viral diseases in Puerto Rico using secondary data 
from published studies evaluating the etiology of acute fe­
brile illness of any patient, such as sentinel surveillance at 
St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital in the cities of Ponce and 
Guayama (10,11).
We determined an excess of 1,310 deaths concurrent 
with the peak of the chikungunya epidemic of 2014 in 
Puerto Rico. We found no substantial occurrence of den­
gue, influenza, or leptospirosis during the chikungunya epi­
demic, according to data from St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospi­
tal (Figure 1) and official Puerto Rico surveillance (10,12), 
reinforcing the possibility that chikungunya might be etio­
logically associated with the deaths. Although the most af­
fected age group was persons >75 years of age, a statisti­
cally significant proportion of deaths occurred in persons 
24–55 years of age, suggesting chikungunya-associated 
deaths are not exclusive to elderly persons (Figure 2).
The estimated mortality rate was 30.1 deaths/100,000 
population, compatible with the excess deaths observed in

 Excess Mortality and Chikungunya, Puerto Rico
Réunion Island in 2006 (33.8/100,000 population) using 
similar methods (5) and slightly below the estimated rate of 
47.9 deaths/100,000 population in Pernambuco, the most 
affected state of Brazil, during the chikungunya epidemic 
of 2016 (7). We estimated excess deaths as 42 times greater 
than the 31 deaths identified by the official surveillance de­
veloped during the chikungunya epidemic in Puerto Rico 
(3). In a similar study conducted in northeastern Brazil, we 
found 7,231 excess deaths in the region during the chikun­
gunya epidemic of 2016, when the official surveillance sys­
tem confirmed only 120 deaths, 60 times lower (7).
We detected a 1-month lag between the peak of chi­
kungunya identified by St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital and 
the peak of excess deaths. Other lags also were observed 
in similar studies in Ahmedabad, India; Mauritius; and re­
cently in Brazil (6,7); these lags can be explained by pro­
longed hospitalization before death (2).
Deaths classified as “all other forms of chronic isch­
emic heart disease” (International Classification of Dis­
eases, 10th Revision, codes I20, I25.1–I25.9) and diabetes 
mellitus (E10–E14) increased significantly, but deaths as­
sociated with other important causes of death, such as acute 
myocardial infarction (I21, I22) and neoplasms (C00–D49), 
did not (Table 1). These findings suggest that chikungu­
nya contributes substantially to severity through its own 
pathophysiologic mechanisms and that some preexisting 
conditions participate only as additional risk factors for death. 
The most frequent clinically worsening conditions described 
in laboratory-confirmed chikungunya in other settings were 
heart failure, multiple organ failure, acute hepatitis, encephali­
tis, epidermolysis bullosa, myocarditis, respiratory failure, and 
renal failure (2). Many of these causes of death on Réunion 
Island (3) also increased over previous years in Puerto Rico 
during the epidemic (Table 2). In this study, volume deple­
tion, emphysema, arrhythmias, asthma, diabetes mellitus and 
chronic ischemic heart disease led to a higher mortality rate 
during the epidemic than during previous years; all of these

diseases were found as cause of death or preexisting condition 
in patients with severe chikungunya (2,13).
Conclusions
We found substantial excess mortality in Puerto Rico dur­
ing the 2014 chikungunya epidemic, which should no lon­
ger be treated as a nonlethal disease. In addition to elderly 
persons, excess deaths occurred in other age groups. The 
main causes of death in patients with laboratory-confirmed 
chikungunya in hospital-based studies were similar to those 
in our study (2,13). 
Our study reinforces the hypothesis of the association 
of chikungunya with severe manifestations and deaths. 
Chikungunya-related death is critical to defining public 
health priorities, such as investment in research, vaccine 
development, and vector control. The evaluation of excess 
deaths is a tool that should be included in the assessment of 
chikungunya epidemics.
The results of our study are subject to several limita­
tions. We conducted an ecologic analysis, which does not 
enable establishment of causality, and the investigation was 
based on secondary data, which may result in some inaccu­
racies. Therefore, some of the excess deaths we calculated 
might have resulted from other diseases, particularly vec­
torborne diseases, which have seasonal patterns of occur­
rence similar to those of chikungunya. However, we tried 
to reduce these limitations using several sources of informa­
tion and accounting for other diseases that could interfere in 
the deaths in the region, including other viral diseases. The 
method used in this study is already well known and widely 
used to estimate deaths and hospitalizations associated with 
respiratory viruses and extreme weather phenomena (14,15).

 Excess Mortality and Chikungunya, Puerto Rico
Although limited, our results raise important ques­
tions about the occurrence of severe disease and increased 
mortality rates associated with chikungunya. Therefore, 
fundamental research is needed about chikungunya patho­
physiologic mechanisms involving severe forms, exacer­
bation of preexisting conditions, and deaths. In addition to 
clinical studies, systematic diagnostic research of recent 
infection, including chikungunya, in all severe hospital­
ized patients during outbreaks could answer some impor­
tant questions.

Surveillance to investigate the wildlife–vector transmission 
cycle of the human pathogen Borrelia miyamotoi in Cali­
fornia, USA, revealed infections in dusky-footed woodrats, 
brush mice, and California mice. Phylogenetic analyses 
suggest a single, well-supported clade of B. miyamotoi is 
circulating in California.
B
orrelia miyamotoi is a spirochete that causes a relaps­
ing febrile illness and is transmitted by hard Ixodes 
species ticks (1,2). B. miyamotoi is prevalent in western 
black-legged tick (I. pacificus) populations in California, 
USA (3,4); in some locations, B. miyamotoi prevalence in 
ticks is comparable with or higher than the prevalence of 
the Lyme disease agent, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (3–5). 
There is mounting evidence that human infections occur in 
northern California (6).
Surveillance of B. miyamotoi in California has focused 
on ticks, and little is known about infection in wildlife hosts. 
B. miyamotoi has been identified from spleen samples of birds 
and rodents in Europe (7), from blood and bladder samples of 
rodents in Japan (8), and from white-footed mice (Peromyscus 
leucopus) in the eastern United States (9). In California, sur­
veillance in Alameda County (east of the San Francisco Bay) 
observed B. miyamotoi in tick populations but failed to detect 
the spirochete in mammals (10). We investigated B. miya­
motoi infection status in small mammals at 3 California sites 
where the bacterium is present in tick populations (3,5).
The Study
We captured animals on 2 consecutive nights at each of 3 
sites in the San Francisco Bay area of California during June 
2014: Windy Hill (37.37315°, –122.22466°) and Thorne­
wood (37.39086°, –122.25066°) Open Space Preserves 
(OSP) in San Mateo County, and Foothills Park (37.36243°, 
–122.17362°) in Santa Clara County. We chose these sites on 
the basis of local B. miyamotoi prevalence of 3.6%–10.7% in 
I. pacificus nymphs (5). Trapping occurred in June to coincide 
with the peak abundance of nymphal black-legged ticks and 
so perhaps increase the chance that B. miyamotoi would be 
circulating in animal populations (11). Animals were captured 
using Sherman live traps baited with peanut butter and oats. 
We anesthetized captured animals with isoflurane, 
identified them by morphology using taxonomic guides, 
and examined them for ticks. We obtained blood and ear-
tissue biopsy samples from each individual and tested both 
sample types for Borrelia spp. because different Borrelia 
species may vary in tissue tropism (9).
We extracted DNA from all samples (i.e., whole blood, 
ear punch biopsies, and ticks) using DNeasy Blood and Tis­
sue Kits (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) and assayed for 
the presence of Borrelia using quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
(9), which is able to detect as few as 10 spirochetes. We se­
quenced all qPCR-positive samples using a primer set tar­
geting the intergenic spacer rrs-rrlA locus, which allowed 
for differentiation of Borrelia genospecies (12). Alignments 
were made in ClustalX (http://www.clustal.org). We com­
pared our sequences from I. pacificus ticks and wild-caught 
rodents (GenBank accession nos. MH342008–31) to repre­
sentative GenBank sequences from isolates found in other 
sites in California (accession nos. KT343321, KT343334, 
KT343337, KU184505, KF957668), elsewhere in the United 
States (accession nos. HQ658901, HQ658902, AY374140, 
AY37139, AY374138, AY363706, GU993308, KY293400, 
KY293399, KY293398, KY293397, KY293396, GQ856588, 
GU993309, GQ856589), Japan (accession nos. AY363703, 
AY363704), and Sweden (accession no. AY363705). We 
conducted phylogenetic reconstruction using MrBayes 
(http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/) and visualizations using Fig­
Tree (http:// tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
We captured a total of 117 small mammals from 5 spe­
cies (Table 1). Our surveillance efforts demonstrate that B. 
miyamotoi infects woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes), brush mice 
(Peromyscus boylii), and California mice (P. californicus) 
(Table 2). At sites where B. miyamotoi was present in small 
mammals, B. miyamotoi prevalence was 6%–33% in dif­
ferent host species (Table 2). These data reflect B. miyamo­
toi prevalence in small-mammal hosts in other geographic

regions: 10.7% of voles and mice (n = 65) in the Netherlands, 
where nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) of B. miyamotoi 
in I. ricinus ticks is 2.5% (84/3360) (7), and 6.5% of white-
footed mice (P. leucopus) in the northeastern United States, 
where NIP in I. scapularis ticks is 5.5% (38/689) (9). We did 
not observe B. miyamotoi in pinyon mice or deer mice, either 
because of small sample sizes or because these species are 
not involved in B. miyamotoi transmission. In nearby Alam­
eda County, B. miyamotoi was not observed in small mam­
mals (10); possible reasons are that the spirochete is rarer in 
this locality (NIP = 0.4% in Alameda study sites), that mam­
mal capture periods were dispersed across multiple years and 
not as coincident with nymphal tick activity, or that brush 
mice and California mice were not captured at that location.
Other identified Borrelia species included B. bissettiae in 
1 pinyon mouse (P. truei) and 1 brush mouse, which mirrors 
earlier studies of B. bissettiae from farther north in California 
(13,14). Woodrats, California voles (Microtus californicus), 
deer mice (P. maniculatus), and black rats (Rattus rattus) have 
also been observed infected with B. bissettiae (10,13). During 
previous tick sampling efforts at our study sites, we did not de­
tect B. bissettiae in questing western black-legged ticks (3,5).
We did not find B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, although 
we observed uncharacterized B. burgdorferi sensu lato 
infection in 1 California mouse. None of the animals cap­
tured in the redwood habitat (Thornewood OSP) were in­
fected with Borrelia spp., although the sample size was 
small at this location (Table 1). We found a co-infection 
of B. burgdorferi sl and B. miyamotoi in a brush mouse. 
Co-infections of B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi have 
previously been reported from mice and ticks in the 
northeastern United States (9) and from ticks in Marin 
County, California (4).
Five mammals were infested with I. angustus ticks, of 
which we observed all 3 life stages. In redwood habitat at 
Thornewood OSP, 1 California mouse hosted 2 adult females 
and a nymph, 1 brush mouse was infested with 2 adult fe­
males and 2 nymphs, and 1 brush mouse carried 1 female 
and 1 nymphal tick. Of 2 brush mice captured at Windy Hill, 
1 harbored 3 larvae and the other 5 larvae. None of the 17 I. 
angustus ticks tested positive for Borrelia spp., nor did the 
host animals from which the ticks were removed. We found 
no I. pacificus ticks infesting the small mammals.
Phylogenetic analyses suggest that B. miyamotoi in 
California is a single strain, separate from B. miyamotoi 
in the eastern United States and from strains circulating in 
Asia and Europe (Figure), corroborating an earlier study 
(15). Sequences from I. pacificus ticks previously col­
lected in the San Francisco Bay area were identical to the 
sequences obtained from rodent infections.
Conclusions
The identification of B. miyamotoi in small mammals in 
California mirrors research from other locations that have 
documented the spirochete in small rodents. It is premature 
to claim these infected species as B. miyamotoi reservoirs 
(i.e., responsible for maintenance of the pathogen and act­
ing as a source for of zoonotic transmission), in part because

DISPATCHES
B. miyamotoi can also be transmitted transovarially in the 
tick population; local maintenance of the spirochete may not 
require a reservoir host. Nonetheless, in California, where B. 
miyamotoi clusters into a single, well-supported phylogenet­
ic clade, the spirochete appears to be circulating among ro­
dent species. Xenodiagnostic investigation of these putative 
reservoir species, as well as more comprehensive investiga­
tions of the reservoir potential of other local fauna, includ­
ing larger mammals (e.g., squirrels and deer) and birds, will 
further elucidate the ecology of B. miyamotoi in California.

Genome degradation has been central to the adaptation 
of Salmonella enterica serotypes to their hosts throughout 
evolution. We witnessed the patho-adaptation of a strain of 
Salmonella Dublin (a cattle-adapted serotype) to a human 
host during the course of a recurrent prosthetic hip joint in­
fection evolving over several years.
S
almonella enterica serotype Dublin is a host-adapted 
bacterium with cattle as a predominant reservoir and 
is responsible for invasive, potentially life-threatening in­
fections in humans (1,2). In France, the epidemiology of 
Salmonella Dublin infections among humans corroborates 
surveillance data from the United States (1). Salmonella 
Dublin causes substantially more bloodstream infections 
and hospitalizations than other Salmonella serotypes. It is 
also much more likely to be isolated in metastatic foci of 
infection secondary to bacteremia. The prevalence of pros­
thetic joints in Salmonella Dublin patients is significantly 
greater than for other Salmonella cases (Table).
Host adaptation is central to pathogen evolution and is 
associated with gene acquisition, genome degradation (gene 
inactivation or deletion), or both. Genome degradation has 
played a major role in the adaptation of S. enterica serotypes 
Typhi and Paratyphi A to the human host throughout evo­
lution (3). Degradation also has been recently reported in a 
severely immunocompromised patient in whom recurrent 
systemic Salmonella Enteritidis infections developed over 
15 years (4). We report the phenotypic and genomic changes 
undergone by Salmonella Dublin throughout a recurrent 
prosthetic hip infection in an immunocompetent patient.
The Study
In May 2011, a 74-year-old woman with bilateral hip pros­
theses (implanted in 1998 [right] and 2001 [left]) was ad­
mitted to intensive care for sepsis and left hip pain (online 
Technical Appendix Figure, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/24/12/18-0214-Techapp1.pdf). Blood cultures and 
a joint aspiration yielded pure cultures of Salmonella spp. 
She underwent debridement and implant retention surgery, 
followed by a 6-week intravenous course of cefotaxime and 
ciprofloxacin. Three years later, she sought care at the emer­
gency department with acute-onset fever and prosthesis joint 
infection of the right hip and underwent right hip debride­
ment and implant retention surgery. Blood cultures, joint 
aspirates, and all interoperative periprosthetic tissue samples 
yielded Salmonella spp. The patient received 2 weeks of in­
travenous amoxicillin and oral ofloxacin, was discharged, 
and received oral antimicrobial drugs for 10 more weeks. Six 
weeks after surgery, the surgical wound was healed, and the 
patient walked normally. One year later (2015), her primary 
care physician referred her to the hospital because of night 
fevers without local signs or implant dysfunction. Radioleu­
coscintigraphy showed right hip inflammation. Bilateral hip 
biopsies were performed, and the right hip biopsy sample 
tested positive for Salmonella spp. A right hip 1-stage ex­
change procedure was performed. All intraoperative peri­
prosthetic tissue samples yielded Salmonella spp. A 6-week 
course of intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone and cipro­
floxacin was administered. One year later (2016), the patient 
appeared to be free from infection and walked normally.
We characterized isolates by matrix-assisted laser de­
sorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker 
Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) and serotyping (French 
National Reference Center for Salmonella). We assessed 
carbohydrate metabolic activity using the API50CH system 
(bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France) and biofilm formation 
using crystal violet (5). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
was performed using 2015 EUCAST (European Committee 
on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) guidelines (http://
www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints/). 
We 
conducted 
high-throughput whole-genome sequencing using the Illu­
mina NextSeq 500 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

For each isolate, the paired-end reads were aligned against 
2 Salmonella Dublin CT_020221853 and 3246 reference 
genomes to increase the single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) detection (GenBank accession nos. CP001144.1 and 
CM001151.1, respectively) (6) (online Technical Appen­
dix). We annotated putative coding sequences using Gen­
eMark (7) and performed ortholog identification, based on 
the prototypal human reference genome CT_020221853, 
using BLAST+ (8) with a 1 × 10–10 E-value threshold and 
confirmed by a synteny conservation check. We first identi­
fied candidate pseudogenized sequences using a proteome/
proteome BLASTp approach (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi): protein sequences of strains Str.2011, Str2014, 
and Str2015 with Query Coverage <80% relative to the ref­
erence strain orthologs were selected as potentially pseudo­
genized sequences. We then analyzed nucleic acid level se­
quences corresponding to the previously selected candidates 
to confirm the change in coding sequences, and to precisely 
determine the genetic event kind of nucleic acid change in­
volved (frame-shift mutation or indel).
We studied 3 patient strains: Str.2011 (May 2011, left 
hip intraoperative periprosthetic tissue [HIPT]), Str.2014 
(April 2014, right HIPT), and Str.2015 (June 2015, right 
HIPT). Unlike Str.2011, Str.2014 and Str.2015 were non­
motile with no detectable H antigen and had lost the ability 
to use 9 of the 18 carbohydrates used by Str.2011, with 
slight profile variations (Figure). All strains could form 
biofilms and had identical wild-type antimicrobial drug 
susceptibility profiles and unchanged MICs for β-lactams 
and quinolones, without mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC, 
and parE genes. All 3 strains belonged to the sequence 
type 10 Salmonella Dublin population (http://mlst.war­
wick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Senterica). The mapping of Str.2011, 
Str.2014, and Str.2015 genomes against the Salmonella 
Dublin CT_020221853 and str.3246 reference genomes 
detected 451 and 268 SNPs, respectively, whereas the 3 
patient strains differed by only 6 SNPs, strongly suggest­
ing they derived from a single infecting strain. Four SNPs 
were nonsynonymous in coding genes; 2 SNPs were in an 
intergenic region (Figure).
Comparative proteome/proteome analysis detected 
putative pseudogenized sequences that were due to in­
dels within 3 coding sequences in Str.2014 and Str.2015. 
These pseudogenes were involved in carbohydrate trans­
port (ptsA) (14-bp deletion), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bio­
synthesis (waaY) (16-bp insertion), and protein synthesis 
(tufB) (790-bp deletion, total gene deletion); we identified 
no pseudogene among the genes of the flagellar regulon. 
The pseudogene involved in carbohydrate transport, ptsA, 
controls the import of carbohydrates, such as mannose, 
fructose, and N-acetyl-glucosamine (9), 3 carbohydrates 
used by Str.2011 but not Str.2014 or Str.2015. Mutation of 
the LPS biosynthesis gene waaY in Str.2014 and Str.2015 
had apparently no effect on the expression of the Salmo­
nella Dublin O antigen but might have affected flagellar 
assembly and function, as described for Salmonella Ty­
phimurium and Escherichia coli (10,11). The mutation of 
tufB in Str.2014 and Str.2015 leads to a one third decrease 
in the production of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu 
(the other two thirds is synthetized from tufA) (12).

The patient in this study had no detectable gallblad­
der or intestinal carriage, which has been associated with 
recurrent Salmonella infections (13). She had no appar­
ent immunodeficiency, a well-documented risk factor for 
invasive Salmonella Dublin infection. Salmonella Dublin 
most likely persisted as a biofilm at the surface of the im­
plants, leading to recurrence of chronic disease despite 
prolonged antimicrobial therapy until the ablation of the 
infected material (14). The genomic changes we observed 
involved carbohydrate metabolism and LPS biosynthesis,

Salmonella Dublin and Prosthetic Joint Infection
as similarly reported for Salmonella Enteritidis isolates 
recovered from the bloodstream of a severely immuno­
compromised patient, years after the initial infection (4). 
Changes in carbon source availability are known to affect 
virulence gene regulators. In the presence/absence of a spe­
cific carbon source, specific virulence genes can be turned 
on or switched off, enabling pathogens to adapt to their new 
niche (9). Because LPS and flagellin are potent triggers of 
the inflammatory response, LPS alterations and the loss of 
flagellin expression (15) might have limited the host’s in­
nate immune response to Salmonella Dublin and facilitated 
its persistence at the implant interface.
Conclusions
This clinical case and other recent reports of patients with 
chronic infections highlight the remarkable adaptability of 
pathogens to a new niche. More specifically, these results 
show that the process of patho-adaptation of Salmonella se­
rotypes may be extremely rapid and relies on mechanisms 
of genomic reshaping reminiscent of those found during 
the evolution of this pathogen in contact with humans. En­
hanced awareness is warranted for Salmonella Dublin, es­
pecially in the elderly bearing prostheses.

Scrub Typhus Risk Factor Study Group1
Scrub typhus is associated with outbreaks of acute enceph­
alitis syndrome in Uttar Pradesh, India. A case-control study 
indicated that children residing, playing, or visiting fields; liv­
ing with firewood stored indoors; handling cattle fodder; and 
practicing open defecation were at increased risk for scrub 
typhus. Communication messages should focus on chang­
ing these behaviors.
O
utbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with 
high case-fatality rates have been reported from Gora­
khpur district, Uttar Pradesh, India, for >2 decades. These 
outbreaks occur during monsoon and postmonsoon seasons 
and predominantly affect children. Scrub typhus (ST) ac­
counted for about two thirds of AES cases (1–4) and is 
also an important etiology of acute febrile illness (AFI) in 
the region (5). Untreated cases of ST-attributable AFI can 
progress to AES.
ST, caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, is 
transmitted by the bite of trombiculid mites, which live in 
moist soil covered with vegetation (6). Several risk factors, 
including certain household characteristics, work-related 
practices, and behaviors, have been identified among adult 
ST patients (7–11). Household characteristics include loca­
tion of the house near a grassland, vegetable field, or ditch; 
presence of mud floors; piled weeds inside the house; and 
scrub vegetation in the vicinity (7). Work-related practices 
include working in vegetable fields or hilly areas and work­
ing in short sleeves or with bare hands (8). Certain behaviors 
such as lying on grass and squatting to defecate or urinate also 
are associated with ST (8,10,11). Because these risk factors 
are region specific, we conducted an exploratory case-control 
study among children in Gorakhpur and Deoria districts of 
Uttar Pradesh to identify factors associated with ST infection.
The Study
We conducted AFI surveillance in public health facilities in 
Deoria (n = 5) and Gorakhpur (n = 3) districts during Octo­
ber 3–November 11, 2017, a period coinciding with AES out­
breaks in Gorakhpur district. We enrolled children 2–15 years 
of age with a >3-day history of fever, from whom we col­
lected 2 mL of blood after obtaining written informed consent 
from parents and assent from children 7–15 years of age. We 
screened serum samples for IgM and IgG against O. tsutuga­
mushi by using ELISA kits (Scrub Typhus Detect; InBios In­
ternational Inc., Seattle, WA, USA). For our study, an optical 
density value >0.5 indicated IgM positivity. This cutoff has 
93% sensitivity and 91% specificity for ST diagnosis (12). An 
optical density value <0.5 indicated IgM and IgG negativity.
Febrile children who were positive for O. tsutugamu­
shi  IgM were considered case-patients, whereas patients 
who were seronegative for IgM and IgG were considered 
controls. Case-patients and controls and their parents or 
guardians were interviewed in their houses by using a 
pretested structured questionnaire to collect informa­
tion on sociodemographics, household characteristics, 
behaviors, and environmental exposures during the 2 
weeks before fever onset. Interviewers were blinded to 
the case-patient or control status of children except dur­
ing the first week of study.

We calculated crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs 
associated with different exposures. We included variables 
with p value <0.2 in univariate analysis in a stepwise back­
ward elimination model to identify variables for inclusion in 
the final unconditional multiple logistic regression model by 
using Stata 13 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).
We recruited 819 AFI patients, of whom 155 (18.9%) 
had O. tsutugamushi IgM (case-patients) and 409 (49.9%) 
were seronegative (controls) (online Technical Appendix 
Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0695-
Techapp1.pdf). We excluded 255 (31.1%) patients who had 
only O. tsutugamushi IgG. We interviewed all case-patients 
and 406 controls. All case-patients and controls were from 
rural areas. The mean age of case-patients was higher than 
controls (7.0 vs. 6.3 years; p = 0.018); 39% of case-patients 
and 51% controls were <5 years of age. A higher propor­
tion of case-patients than controls were from households that 
owned agricultural land (83% vs. 73%; p = 0.017) (Table 1). 
Aside from fever, clinical signs and symptoms among 
patients varied (online Technical Appendix Table 2). Five 
ST patients, who did not receive doxycycline/azithromycin, 
had onset of neurologic manifestations and required hospital­
ization; they recovered after administration of azithromycin.
Univariate analysis showed that ST patients were 
more likely than controls to live in houses located within 
or adjoining fields, houses with unpaved surroundings 
with mud or unkempt grass, and mud-floored houses (Ta­
ble 2). In addition, a higher proportion of case-patients 
lived in households that used wood or cow dung for cook­
ing and stored this fuel indoors. Compared with controls, 
children with ST were more likely to have played in ag­
ricultural fields, defecated in agricultural fields, bathed in 
a river or stream, carried grass bundles on their heads, 
handled fodder for cattle, or visited or accompanied par­
ents to an agricultural field during the 2 weeks before fe­
ver onset (Table 2).
Multivariable analysis showed that children residing 
in houses within or adjoining fields (adjusted OR [aOR] 
1.56, 95% CI 1.02–2.38) and that stored firewood indoors 
(aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.06–2.45) had higher odds of acquir­
ing ST. Open defecation (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.18–3.39), 
playing in (aOR 5.2, 95% CI 1.92–14.2) or visiting (aOR 
1.65, 95% CI 1.07–2.52) agricultural fields, and handling 
cattle fodder (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.13–3.70) also were as­
sociated with ST (Table 2).
Conclusions
In Gorakhpur and Deoria districts, recent exposure to the 
outdoor environment, either while defecating or playing in 
agricultural fields, as well as visiting agricultural fields, stor­
ing firewood indoors, and handling fodder for cattle were as­
sociated with higher risk for acquiring ST among children. 
Of these risk factors, defecation in the agricultural field was 
the most common exposure at the population level. The 
observed association of ST and defecation in fields is con­
sistent with the findings from an ST outbreak in Manipur, 
India, where persons who defecated or urinated in the jungle 
or bushy areas were found to be at higher risk for ST (11). In 
Gorakhpur and Deoria districts, about one third of the study 
population had toilets, a finding consistent with the 2015 na­
tional level survey, which indicated that 29.5% of the house­
holds in rural Uttar Pradesh had sanitary toilets and 27.3% of 
households that had access to toilets were using them (http://
www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/Swachh%20Survek­
shan%20Report%20Eng.PDF). Efforts to prevent ST in the 
region therefore also need to focus on constructing house­
hold and community toilets, as well as behavior change com­
munication about avoiding open defecation in the fields. In 
addition, storing firewood and fodder indoors attracts rodents 
that can harbor mites. Mites present on the firewood and fod­
der collected from fields might expose children to mite bites 
during storage or handling of the cattle fodder.

Risk for Scrub Typhus among Children, India
DISPATCHES

Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 24, No. 12, December 2018
Our study had limitations. First, although OT IgM is 
detectable as early as 4 days after fever onset (13), some 
ST patients in our study might have been negative for IgM 
and hence misclassified as controls. However, such non­
differential misclassification is likely to underestimate the 
actual association. Further, the median duration of fever 
was 7 days (interquartile range 4.5–10.0 days) among case-
patients and 5 days (interquartile range 4–8 days) among 
controls (Table 1), indicating minimal possibility of such 
misclassification. Some controls might have been misclas­
sified as case-patients because of persistence of IgM from 
previous infection (14). However, this possibility is less 
likely considering that IgM peaks by 4 weeks of infection 
and declines rapidly thereafter (15). Second, our control-
patients were AFI patients from healthcare facilities and 
not healthy children from the general population. Never­
theless, the behaviors of children visiting healthcare facili­
ties before their febrile illness and children from the gen­
eral population are less likely to be different.
For prevention of ST among children in Gorakhpur 
and Deoria districts, communication messages should fo­
cus on changing behaviors such as defecating or playing

We report a case of myositis in a male patient in Austra­
lia who had progressive weakness and wasting in his left 
lower limb. Although clinical, pathological, and laboratory 
assessments were inconclusive, a new, nested PCR–cou­
pled sequencing method enabled the unequivocal diagno­
sis of myositis caused by the enigmatic nematode Hay­
cocknema perplexum.
I
n 2017, a 37-year-old male resident of the eastern coast 
of Tasmania, Australia, arrived at Royal Hobart Hospital 
reporting a 2-year history of progressive muscle weakness 
and wasting in his left lower limb. He had also developed 
weakness in his left upper limb 6 months before clinical 
examination. Initially, he underwent a neurologic assess­
ment for motor neurone disease before being referred to the 
hospital. The patient is a recreational hunter and consumes 
bushmeat; his only travel history was to Melbourne, Victo­
ria, Australia.
The Study 
Clinical examination revealed that this patient walked 
with a mild limp and a high stepping gait on the left. The 
Romberg test result was unremarkable, and tandem gait 
and coordination were normal. There was marked wasting 
of the left vastus lateralis and the gastrocnemius muscles 
and mild wasting of the left biceps and triceps muscles. 
There were no associated fasciculations. Muscle power 
was reduced on the left side, with weakness of hip flexion 
(3+/5), knee extension (4+/5), and flexion (3+/5). The pa­
tient was unable to squat fully. Reflexes were reduced on 
the left compared with the right side, and plantar reflexes 
were recorded as normal bilaterally. No objective sensory 
deficit was detected. Cranial nerve function, specifically 
extraocular muscles, speech, and tongue power and move­
ment, appeared normal. Axial muscles appeared to func­
tion normally.
Complementary serologic tests revealed no evidence 
of antibodies for Toxocara, Toxoplasma, Trichinella, or 
Strongyloides. Test results for serum calcium, magne­
sium, and phosphate were within reference ranges, but 
serum creatinine kinase was elevated at 3,636 IU/L (refer­
ence range 22–198). Electrophoretic analysis for multiple 
myeloma revealed a diffuse increase in gamma globulin 
but no paraprotein. Liver function tests revealed that lev­
els of alanine aminotransferase (139 IU/L) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (94 IU/L) were elevated, whereas urea 
electrolytes and creatinine were within reference ranges. 
Full blood examination revealed a transient mild eosino­
philia (0.54 × 109 cells/L).
Magnetic resonance imaging did not detect abnor­
malities in the brain or spinal cord, although a posterior 
disk protrusion relating to a slight central canal stenosis 
was observed. Nerve conduction results were within ref­
erence range, but electromyographic evaluations revealed 
active and chronic denervation changes confined to the 
left upper and lower limbs, consistent with a myopathic 
process. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy speci­
men (20 × 20 × 5 mm2) taken from the left vastus latera­
lis muscle revealed a chronic, destructive myopathy with 
inflammation, including eosinophils. This examination 
detected variation in muscle fiber size and patchy foci of 
inflammatory cell infiltrates, predominantly lymphocytic, 
but also with scattered eosinophils and some active myo­
cyte destruction. There was an increase in interstitial fi­
brosis; many of the fibers appeared degenerative, some 
showed extensive vacuolation, and others were in the 
process of regenerating. Fibers appeared split, and some 
of them had internal nuclei. Occasional fibers had inclu­
sions within the sarcoplasm, which appeared rounded, 
with central irregular eosinophilic and brown areas. No 
glycogen or lipid was found within vacuoles, and there 
was evidence of some cytochrome oxidase depletion. The 
muscle appeared to be type I dominant with atrophic type 
1 and 2 fibers. 
On the basis of these findings, we made a diagnosis of 
chronic destructive myopathy with inflammation (includ­
ing eosinophils), with differential diagnoses of inclusion 
body myositis and parasitic myositis. We conducted exam­
inations for autoimmune disorders, but results for dsDNA,

antinuclear antibody, and extractable nuclear antigen tests 
were within reference ranges.
When the patient’s condition showed no clinical im­
provement, we administered therapeutic doses of alben­
dazole (400 mg 2×/d) for 3 months. The patient’s clinical 
status improved, and creatinine kinase levels in serum de­
creased to 387 IU/L. He remained on surveillance as an 
outpatient for 7 months. On the basis of this clinical evi­
dence and the patient’s history, we suspected an infection 
with H. perplexum nematodes.
From a 2-mm3 portion of the same muscle biopsy 
sample used for the previous histopathologic examination 
and frozen, we extracted genomic DNA using the DNeasy 
PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, the Netherlands) and then 
subjected 2-µL aliquots of this DNA sample to 2 new nest­
ed PCR assays adapted from an established method  (1–3) 
that had not amplified products from the same sample. The 
2 optimized nested PCRs (Table 1) successfully amplified 
products of the expected sizes (≈400 bp for cox-1 and ≈830 
bp for SSU) from this sample, and these amplicons were 
directly sequenced (3).
We assessed the sequences obtained (GenBank acces­
sion nos. MH667568 [cox-1] and MH667568 [SSU]) for 
quality, compared them (using blastn, https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) with publicly available sequences in 
the GenBank database to confirm the diagnosis of H. per­
plexum nematode infection, and then aligned them with 
respective reference sequences from this database, as de­
scribed previously (3), to assess genetic variability. From 
the resultant cox-1 amplicon, we obtained 385 bp of clean 
sequence that varied by 1.3%–5.7% from previously de­
termined cox-1 sequences from Haycocknema nematodes 
(GenBank accession nos. KU531719 and KU531720, rep­
resenting Tasmania and Queensland, respectively [3]). As 
expected, the cox-1 sequences from samples from Tasma­
nia were more closely related to one another than to 1 from 
Queensland. A comparison of all three cox-1 sequences of 
H. perplexum nematodes (>348 nt) revealed 1 nonsynony­
mous and 24 synonymous mutations. From the resultant 
SSU amplicon, we obtained 831 bp of clean sequence, 
which varied by 0.5%–0.6% from SSU sequences reported 
previously for Haycocknema nematodes (GenBank acces­
sion nos. KU531721 and KU531722 representing Tasmania 
and Queensland, respectively [3]), whereas the sequences 
KU531721 and KU531722 differed by only 0.1% (1 nt).
Conclusions
This case was consistent clinically with some previous 
cases (3–9) associated with H. perplexum infection in Tas­
mania and Queensland (Table 2). PCR-coupled sequenc­
ing enabled an etiologic diagnosis, although this diagnosis 
was not possible based on clinical, clinicopathologic, and 
histopathologic findings. The analytical sensitivity of the 
nested PCRs allowed for the ready and specific detection 
of H. perplexum DNA within the muscle DNA sample. 
The genetic distinctiveness recorded here was also seen 
previously between samples from cases from Tasmania 
and Queensland. Although it is speculative, this informa­
tion lends additional support for some population genetic 
substructuring within Haycocknema (because of geo­
graphic or reproductive isolation). It is possible that the 
3 distinct genotypes recorded may differ in their biology, 
host affiliation, transmission pattern(s), or a combination 
of these factors if they turn out to be transmitted from 
animals to humans.
There has been considerable controversy surrounding 
the biology and transmission of H. perplexum nematodes 
(3,5). It appears that only 4 of 9 cases of human infection 
recorded to date (the case we report and 3 previous cases 
[7,8,10]) had histories of the patients consuming bushmeat, 
which suggests the possibility of other routes of trans­
mission. Other than locations in Tasmania and northern 
Queensland, the common thread among most clinical cases 
is an association with an exposure to native wildlife (e.g., 
through hunting, bush walking, caring for wildlife, keep­
ing wildlife as pets, doing botanical fieldwork, or consum­
ing native bushmeat [3,4,6–9]). However, Koehler et al. 
(3) suggested that H. perplexum nematodes might use an

ies surrounding H. perplexum nematodes, including taxo­
nomic classification, biology, reservoir host animals, and 
transmission to humans to cause disease, provide exciting 
paths for future research. The nested PCR–based sequenc­
ing approach we used will aid in such research.

We detected Chuzan virus (CHUV) in domestic yaks from 
the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, western China, indicating 
CHUV probably has been transmitted to yaks in recent 
years. Awareness for CHUV surveillance and transmission 
and livestock health management in these special regions 
should be raised to avoid outbreaks and animal loss.
C
huzan virus (CHUV) belongs to the Palyam serogroup 
of genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. A CHUV out­
break, first reported in Japan in 1985, was the causative 
agent of disease that resulted in many reproductive disor­
ders in cattle, including abortion, stillbirth, and congenital 
malformation (1) and in considerable economic loss in the 
cattle industry.
Like other orbiviruses, CHUV consists of 10 double-
stranded RNA segments (Seg-1 to Seg-10), which encode 
7 structural viral proteins (VP1–VP7) and 4 nonstructural 
proteins (NS1–NS4) (2–4). Seg-2 (VP2) and Seg-6 (VP5) 
of the Palyam serogroup show the highest levels of varia­
tion in genome sequence, which correlates with virus se­
rotype specificity (2). These viruses usually are transmit­
ted by arthropod vectors (5,6). Therefore, CHUV has been 
widespread in many countries of Asia, such as South Korea 
(7) and mainland China (8,9), which have reported CHUV 
infection in cattle. However, no information was available 
about CHUV in yaks (Bos grunniens) on China’s Qinghai-
Tibetan Plateau.
Yaks are an important livestock in the Qinghai-Ti­
betan Plateau. They have been farmed with other live­
stock, such as Tibetan sheep and Tibetan pigs. The high 
prevalence of bluetongue virus (BTV) infection, also 
belonging to genus Orbivirus, has been reported in yaks 
and Tibetan sheep (10). A study in 2016 found an abor­
tion rate in yaks of 21.39% in part of Qinghai Province, 
presumably because of the high prevalence of BTV and 
other related pathogens (10). All these data and CHUV 
infection in cattle in China motivated us to study whether 
CHUV infects yaks.
During August 2016–April 2017, we randomly col­
lected 208 blood samples from apparently healthy do­
mestic yaks, 71 yaks from Gansu Province (46 <1 year of 
age), 64 yaks from Qinghai Province (23 <1 year of age), 
and 73 yaks from Sichuan Province (29 <1 year of age). 
Soon after sampling, total RNAs were extracted and used 
as templates to amplify full-length cDNA by reverse tran­
scription PCR (RT-PCR; SuperScript III Synthesis Kit, In­
vitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). One pair of specific primers 
was designed based on VP2 genome sequence of CHUV 
(online Technical Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.
gov/EID/article/24/12/17-1414-Techapp1.pdf) and used to 
detect CHUV in yaks. We also performed serologic assay 
by using the CHUV 2nd detection kit (iNtRON, IPC11028, 
Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), and the results of the assay 
were then authenticated by RT-PCR.
For phylogenetic and identity analysis of genome se­
quence of 10 segments from CHUV, we designed 10 pairs 
of primer based on known sequences deposited in Gen­
Bank (online Technical Appendix Table 1) to obtain the 
open reading frame genome of these proteins. Phylogenetic 
and identity analyses were performed based on these ge­
nome sequences and the corresponding sequences avail­
able in GenBank.
Five (7%) of the 71 samples were positive for CHUV 
in Gansu Province, 4 of which were <1 year of age (Fig­
ure; online Technical Appendix Table 2). CHUV infection 
in yaks was not found in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. 
Relatively low prevalence of CHUV infection in yaks is 
consistent with the report of CHUV infection in cattle in 
South Korea (7), which was also significantly lower than 
BTV infection in yaks (17.34%) (10). We also obtained 
similar results in serologic investigation. We observed 
neither illness nor disease in these yaks; our results are 
consistent with CHUV infection in sentinel cattle (8) and 
thus suggest that subclinical infection of CHUV occurs 
in cattle. We used heparinized blood samples to inoculate 
baby hamster kidney 21 cells for 5 blind passages, as de­
scribed previously (6,8,9). Infected cells that exhibited a 
wrinkled morphology and were detached from the bottom 
of culture flasks within 5 days (online Technical Appendix 
Figure 1), and 19 segments of CHUV could also be de­
tected by RT-PCR.
Sequence analysis revealed 100% identity of ge­
nomes for Seg-1 to Seg-10 of 3 CHUV sequences in yaks 
(CHN-GS-70). Identity analysis showed that genome se­
quences for Seg-1 to Seg-10 of CHUV shared >98.38% 
nt identities and >98.09% aa identities with CHUV strain 
KT887181/GX871/China in previous studies (8,9) (online 
Technical Appendix Table 3). We constructed 2 phylo­
genetic trees based on VP2 and VP5 genome sequences

of CHUV and other members in genus Orbivirus (online 
Technical Appendix Figures 2, 3). All strains from our 
study were grouped in a new separate cluster and shared 
an ancestor with the strains KT002589/SZ187/China and 
KT887181/GX871/China. Furthermore, CHN-GS-26 and 
CHN-GS-70 were located in the same separate sub-cluster 
(online Technical Appendix Figures 2, 3), which demon­
strated a complicated and transregional transmission cycle 
for CHUV in China.
The yaks that were positive for CHUV were locat­
ed in 2 cities of Gansu Province ≈600 km apart, which 
indicates that transmission of CHUV has spread rapidly 
around the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Further studies are 
needed to determine the epidemiology and evolution 
of CHUV in livestock with concomitant virus isolation 
and phylogenetic analysis. The awareness of livestock 
health management in these special regions should also 
be raised.

During 2016–2017, when Kruger National Park, South 
Africa, was under quarantine to limit bovine tuberculosis 
spread, we examined 35 white and 5 black rhinoceroses 
for infection. We found 6 infected white rhinoceroses during 
times of nutritional stress. Further research on Mycobacte­
rium bovis pathogenesis in white rhinoceroses is needed.
T
uberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuber­
culosis or M. bovis has been reported in captive rhi­
noceroses since the early 1800s (1–3). Bovine TB is en­
demic in many wildlife populations worldwide, including 
among those in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Af­
rica (4). KNP contains the largest free-living population 
of white rhinoceroses in the world (estimated at 6,649–
7,830). However, prolonged drought in South Africa 
(2015–2017) raised concerns that starvation and disease 
could increase the mortality rate and affect conservation 
efforts for this species (5).
In June 2016, a black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis 
minor) with an M. bovis infection was discovered (6). 
Thereafter, a surveillance program was initiated to screen 
rhinoceros carcasses in KNP, leading to 35 white and 5 
black rhinoceros carcasses being examined during June 
2016–October 2017. To determine which animals were 
infected, we conducted macroscopic examinations and 
collected samples for histopathologic studies and myco­
bacterial culture, as previously described (7). Research 
protocols were approved by the South African National 
Park Animal Use and Care Committee and ethics commit­
tee of Stellenbosch University.
No additional cases of M. bovis infection were found in 
black rhinoceroses. However, we confirmed M. bovis infec­
tion in 6 white rhinoceroses (Table). Grossly visible lesions, 
mostly found in the retropharyngeal or tracheobronchial 
lymph nodes or lung, were typically small and localized 
and could easily be missed or mistaken for granulomas 
caused by other pathogens if careful dissections of tissues 
were not performed (online Technical Appendix, https://
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0293-Techapp1.
pdf). On histologic examination, we found granulomatous 
inflammation in lung or lymph node sections and rare acid-
fast organisms in some granulomas (Table). We typed these 
M. bovis isolates as strain SB0121, the most common strain 
found in KNP (8).
Four of the infected animals were found during Sep­
tember–November 2016, near the end of the drought, and 
the remaining 2 animals were found in September and Oc­
tober 2017, at the end of the next winter. The timing of 
infections suggests that animals under nutritional stress 
might be more susceptible to infection, similar to observa­
tions in other species (9). The low number of positive cases 
and localized paucibacillary lesions support the hypothesis 
that white rhinoceroses, although susceptible to infection,

are able to limit disease progression (10). However, wheth­
er infected animals would develop disease if compromised 
is unknown. Location of lesions yielding positive cultures 
suggests an aerosol route of exposure, although M. bovis 
was also isolated from mesenteric and peripheral lymph 
nodes (Table). Although no data were available to evalu­
ate transmission, a previous study has shown white rhinoc­
eroses with localized M. bovis infection did not regularly 
shed bacilli (10). Further research is required to understand 
the pathogenesis and epidemiology of M. bovis infection in 
these animals.
Fresh samples from animals that die naturally are diffi­
cult to locate in a large ecosystem, especially before preda­
tors arrive at the carcass or decomposition occurs due to 
elevated temperatures. In our study, collection of samples 
with minimal degradation was facilitated by our examining 
only rhinoceroses dead for <12 hours and animals eutha­
nized because of their severe state of debilitation, most of­
ten from poaching wounds. Bovine TB was not considered 
the cause of the poor condition or death in any of these 
animals. We found small, nonspecific culture-positive le­
sions histologically similar to those caused by helminths, 
foreign material, and fungi, and the paucibacillary nature 
of the infection could result in false-negative histopatho­
logic results. Therefore, we needed to confirm infection 
by mycobacterial culture and species determination with 
every tissue set collected. However, low numbers of vi­
able bacteria, sample handling, and the likelihood of over­
growth by contaminants could also lead to false-negative 
culture results. Positive culture results from >1 tissue sam­
ple in the same rhinoceros suggests infection rather than 
contamination. However, no cases of disseminated bovine 
TB have been observed in this species, supporting the au­
thors’ hypothesis that the disease in white rhinoceroses is 
self-limiting. Factors such as drought might play a role in 
altering susceptibility to infection, considering no positive 
culture results were obtained in >20 rhinoceros carcasses 
examined before June 2016.
Although disease and death associated with bovine 
TB have not been observed in white rhinoceroses, M. bo­
vis infection nonetheless presents a threat to conservation 
of this species. Genetic management and translocation of 
rhinoceroses are essential components of in situ conser­
vation; animals need to be moved from high-risk poach­
ing areas to more secure locations (5). In addition, calves 
orphaned by poaching require intensive specialized care, 
which is only available outside KNP (5). Because M. bo­
vis is a controlled disease, premises with infected popula­
tions are placed under quarantine to prevent translocation 
of potentially infected animals. With a paucity of data to 
assess risks, movement restrictions are a substantial im­
pediment to conservation and can threaten the survival 
of this population. Therefore, research into antemortem 
detection, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of M. bovis in­
fection is essential for programs to conserve rhinoceroses 
of Africa.

We report a case of chronic Schistosoma haematobium 
infection with pseudometastatic pulmonary nodules and 
high-grade squamous cell carcinoma in a 30-year-old man 
in Mali. Lung biopsies revealed chronic pulmonary involve­
ment of S. haematobium and ruled out lung metastases.
A 
30-year-old man from Mali, who had immigrated to 
France a year before, was hospitalized for acute uri­
nary retention. The patient reported isolated hematuria 
over the preceding month with recent dysuria. He was 
afebrile and had normal vital signs. Physical examination 
revealed pelvis tenderness and guarding. The only bio­
logic abnormality was a hypereosinophilia (1,640 cells/
mm3). Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed 
linear calcifications on the bladder wall, with a large in­
traluminal mass infiltrating the left ureter (Figure, panel 
A). Cystoscopy was typical of schistosomiasis. Anato­
mopathology revealed urinary schistosomiasis compli­
cated by a high-grade, well-differentiated, keratinized 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Figure, panel B). 
Within the wall, ovoid structures, sometimes calcified,

corresponded to bilharzia eggs. We found calcified eggs 
with a terminal spine resembling Schistosoma haemato­
bium in the urine (Figure, panel C). Stool examinations 
were negative. Schistosomiasis serologic tests were posi­
tive in hemagglutination and ELISA and were confirmed 
by immunoblotting. Chest CT revealed multiple, bilat­
eral, diffuse, infracentimetric, pulmonary, ill-defined 
nodules (Figure, panels D, E), suggesting metastases. 
Because secondary lesions contraindicate cystectomy 
and require aggressive chemotherapy, we performed fur­
ther investigations.
The patient was HIV-negative. We excluded tubercu­
losis on the basis of direct examination and culture of spu­
tum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The latter showed 
160,000 cells/mL with hypereosinophilia (11%) and alveo­
lar hemorrhage. Ziehl and Grocott stainings were negative. 
Bacteriologic tests were negative. We detected no tumor 
cell. We resected a nodule during video-assisted thoracos­
copy. Anatomopathology revealed Bilharzia eggs with no 
carcinomatous lesions (Figure, panels F, G). Another nod­
ule showed similar lesions. The eggshells appeared to be 
Ziehl-Neelson–negative, typical of S. haematobium. Echo­
cardiography ruled out pulmonary hypertension.
We confirmed S. haematobium by using molecular 
analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I 
gene. We excluded S. haematobium–bovis hybrid species, 
frequent in Mali, by using internal transcribed spacer re­
gion 1 and 2 sequences (1).

The patient received 2 courses of praziquantel (40 mg/
kg) at 8-week intervals. The tumor was considered free of 
node involvement and metastases. The patient underwent 
radical cystectomy with an orthotopic neobladder. Anatomo­
pathology confirmed complete resection of the tumor reach­
ing the muscle layer and the perivesical fat. At 3 months, 
blood eosinophils were normalized, and chest CT showed 
complete resolution of all pulmonary nodules. At 6-month 
follow-up, the patient was still in complete remission.
Schistosomiasis, the second most prevalent endemic 
parasitic disease, affects ≈230 million persons (2). This 
helminthic infection is caused by a trematode and is also 
known as snail fever or Bilharzia. The larvae burrow into 
human skin after contact with contaminated water and mi­
grate within the vascular system to the lung. Through the 
portal system, mature forms reach venous plexuses sur­
rounding the bladder, and released eggs enter perivesical 
venules. Adult lifespan averages 3–5 years and can persist 
up to 40 years.
Acute schistosomiasis occurs 3–6 weeks after infec­
tion. Eosinophilia serves as a diagnostic clue. Acute lung 
lesions are common (3). S. haematobium, found in Africa 
and the Middle East, induces urinary schistosomiasis with 
frequent hematuria. The infection causes fibrosis of the 
bladder, wall calcification, and hydronephrosis. A major 
complication is the development of SCC. Schistosomiasis-
induced SCC is overrepresented in endemic regions, ac­
counting for only 2.5% of bladder cancer in Western coun­
tries (4,5); it appears as a unique and voluminous mass with 
low incidence of lymph node involvement and distant me­
tastases at 8%–10% (4,5). However, the prognosis remains 
poor, with 90% locoregional recurrence within 3 years. The 
effective treatment requires radical cystectomy.
Manifestations of chronic disease also involve the 
lung, and schistosomiasis is the leading cause of pulmo­
nary hypertension, which occurs in 8%–25% of cases 
(6,7). A less reported aspect of chronic lung involvement 
is nodular lesions, which are described in 5% of schisto­
somiasis cases and are often asymptomatic when isolated 
(8). Belleli was the first to describe S. haematobium eggs 
in the lungs in 1885, stipulating that eggs laying into peri­
vesical plexuses migrate from portal and caval veins to 
the lungs. Embolized eggs can produce a granulomatous 
reaction leading to pulmonary fibrosis and obliterative 
arteriolitis, causing pulmonary hypertension. However, 
the exact pathophysiology remains unclear and involves 
different mechanisms. Pulmonary symptoms are more 
often described with S. mansoni and S. japonicum than 
S. haematobium, which preferentially transits through the 
genitourinary rather than the hepatic portal system (9). Ra­
diographic features resemble coins or cavitations, whereas 
CT shows a ground glass-opacity halo or reticulonodular 
pattern (8). Nodules, considered to be ectopic sites, remain 
unspecific and indistinguishable from secondary lesions 
(6). The diagnosis of chronic lung involvement is oriented 
by symptoms of associated end-organ. Treatment with pra­
ziquantel is efficient on ectopic lesions.
This case is interesting because of the double presen­
tation of schistosomiasis-induced SCC and chronic lung 
involvement. Although metastases are less frequent than 
chronic pulmonary nodules, lung metastases were highly 
expected in the context of invasive SCC. Each diagnosis 
involves a different therapeutic approach, and delayed di­
agnosis can affect the patient’s prognosis. Lung biopsies 
might be necessary when severe disorders are suspected 
and avoided when suspicion for other causes, such as tu­
berculosis and malignancy, is low (8). In the latter sce­
nario, PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid might be an 
alternative in the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary schisto­
somiasis (10).

Strongyloidiasis and 
Culture-Negative Suppurative 
Meningitis, Japan, 1993–2015

Community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae infection and cul­
ture-negative meningitis are rare and atypical subtypes of 
meningitis in adults. Of 37 patients who had atypical sup­
purative meningitis during 1993–2015 in Okinawa, Japan, 
54.5% had strongyloidiasis, of which 9.1% cases were 
hyperinfections and 3.0% dissemination. Strongyloidiasis 
should be considered an underlying cause of atypical sup­
purative meningitis.
A
mong adults, suppurative meningitis caused by en­
teric organisms and suppurative meningitis that is 
culture negative are uncommon (1,2). These types of men­
ingitis with atypical features (hereafter atypical suppura­
tive meningitis) remain a clinical challenge. The mortality 
rate among patients with community-acquired suppurative 
meningitis caused by gram-negative organisms is 52.5% 
(1). Treatment of culture-negative suppurative meningitis 
requires broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs; however, the 
absence of detected pathogens increases the risk for devel­
opment of antimicrobial drug resistance.
Strongyloidiasis, a nematode infection that occurs in 
the subtropics and tropics, is associated with Enterobac­
teriaceae meningitis (3). Previous reports of strongyloidi­
asis-associated meningitis also suggested potential links 
between strongyloidiasis and atypical suppurative menin­
gitis on the basis of 9 cases of Enterobacteriaceae menin­
gitis (not consecutive) (4) and 17 cases of culture-negative 
suppurative meningitis (5). Our aim was to investigate the 
association between strongyloidiasis and atypical suppura­
tive meningitis.
We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients 
who consecutively received a diagnosis of atypical suppu­
rative meningitis during January 1993–December 2015 at 
Okinawa Chubu Hospital, Okinawa, Japan. This hospital 
is one of the largest tertiary medical centers in Okinawa. 
Strongyloidiasis is endemic in Okinawa; reported preva­
lence is 5.2% (6).
We defined atypical suppurative meningitis as suppu­
rative meningitis with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
culture results for enteric organisms or with CSF leukocy­
tosis >500 cells/mm3 and negative CSF culture results. We 
included in the study patients >18 years of age with CSF 
that was culture positive for enteric organisms or negative 
with leukocytosis of >500 cells/mm3. Enteric organisms 
included in this study were Bacteroides spp., Enterococ­
cus spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella 
spp., Bifidobacterium bifidum, Clostridium perfringens, 
Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis), and 
Campylobacter spp. (7). CSF of patients with bacterial 
meningitis typically shows leukocytosis of >1,000 cells/
mm3; CSF of those with nonbacterial meningitis typically 
shows <250 cells/mm3 (8). Considering the early phase 
of bacterial meningitis (9), the cutoff value (500 cells/
mm3) was defined to include suppurative meningitis and 
exclude most cases of nonbacterial meningitis. We ex­
cluded patients with nosocomial meningitis, prior use of 
antimicrobial drugs (within 7 days of lumbar puncture), 
negative CSF culture, and positive blood culture for non­
enteric organisms.
We collected information about patient demographic 
and clinical characteristics, immunocompromised status, 
type of strongyloidiasis infection, outcomes, CSF analysis 
results, and culture results. Strongyloidiasis was classified 
into 3 categories: nonsystemic strongyloidiasis, hyperin­
fection, and dissemination. We defined these categories ac­
cording to where larvae were detected: nonsystemic stron­
gyloidiasis in fecal samples only, hyperinfection in sputum, 
and dissemination in samples other than feces or sputum 
(4). Samples were collected with regard to patients’ clini­
cal category. Identifying information was removed before

analysis. This study was approved by the Okinawa Chubu 
Hospital Institutional Review Board (H29–76).
We identified 37 patients; CSF culture results were 
positive for Enterobacteriaceae for 14 and negative for 23. 
Strongyloidiasis was diagnosed by parasitologic examina­
tions (Table; online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.
cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0375-Techapp1.pdf).
Patients were 19–91 years of age (median 60 years of 
age); 59.5% (22/37) were male. Common chief complaints in­
cluded headache (64.9% [24/37]) and fever (59.5% [22/37]). 
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 serologic test results 
were available for 31 patients, of which 22 (71.0%) were 
positive. Of the 37 total patients, 3 (8.1%) patients had dia­
betes mellitus, 3 (8.1%) had cirrhosis, and 4 (10.8%) used 
steroids on a regular basis. Parasitologic examinations were 
performed for 33 patients, and strongyloides were found 
in 18 (54.5%): 14 (42.4%) nonsystemic strongyloidiasis, 3 
(9.1%) hyperinfection, and 1 (3.0%) dissemination. 
Among 14 culture-positive patients, 5 (35.7%) had 
nonsystemic strongyloidiasis and 3 (21.4%) had hyperin­
fection. Among 19 culture-negative patients, 9 (47.4%) had 
nonsystemic strongyloidiasis and 1 (5.3%) had dissemina­
tion. When culture-positive patients with strongyloidiasis 
were compared with culture-negative patients with stron­
gyloidiasis, the odds ratio was 1.71 (95% CI 0.37–8.22). 
Of note, all strongyloidiasis-positive patients were born 
before 1960, suggesting changes in lifestyle and the envi­
ronment since then (e.g., reduced exposure to contaminated 
soil during farming by not walking barefoot and improved 
farming environments).

RESEARCH LETTERS
In patients with culture-positive meningitis, blood and 
CSF culture results were positive for Klebsiella pneumoni­
ae, S. gallolyticus, E. coli, Streptococcus infantarius, and 
Campylobacter fetus. Among patients with culture-nega­
tive meningitis, blood culture results were positive for K. 
pneumoniae and E. coli.
Our investigation has several limitations because of the 
single-center, retrospective nature of this study. Also, the 
sensitivity of parasitologic examination is low (10). We po­
tentially underestimated the prevalence of strongyloidiasis.
On the basis of previous reports of associations be­
tween strongyloidiasis and Enterobacteriaceae meningitis 
(3,5), our analysis proposes an association between stron­
gyloidiasis and culture-negative suppurative meningitis in 
Okinawa. Our findings suggest that atypical suppurative 
meningitis can occur as occult dissemination (3,4), that an­
thelminthic treatment may be indicated, and that steroids 
should be administered with caution (5). The presence of 
atypical suppurative meningitis in adults should prompt 
consideration of occult disseminated strongyloidiasis; the 
index of suspicion for patients with atypical suppurative 
meningitis is high.

An elderly patient in Belgium who became critically ill af­
ter returning from Hungary was tested for pathogens using 
routine diagnostic tests. All results were negative. How­
ever, using next-generation sequencing on a cultured re­
spiratory sample, laboratorians detected a complete West 
Nile virus genome, similar to strains isolated in southeast­
ern Europe.

W
est Nile virus (WNV) is a widespread reemerging 
global pathogen. Mosquito bites are the source for 
nearly all human infections. These infections usually re­
main asymptomatic; only 20%–40% of infected persons 
experience a mild influenza-like illness called West Nile 
fever. West Nile neuroinvasive disease, which can mani­
fest as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, 
develops in 1% of infected persons; immunosuppressed 
and elderly patients are at higher risk (1). WNV can be 
divided into 5 phylogenetic lineages, of which lineages 
1 and 2 have been associated with many outbreaks in hu­
mans. Since 2010, occasional localized epidemics have 
been ongoing in European and Mediterranean countries 
(2). To date, no autochthonous WNV infections have 
been reported in Belgium, and imported cases are un­
common (3,4). 
An 83-year-old man residing in Antwerp, Belgium, 
who had a medical history of moderate chronic kidney 
disease traveled to Hungary from January through Au­
gust 2017. One day after returning from Hungary, he went 
to the hospital emergency department. He had fever and 
sought treatment for pain in his mouth and throat, which 
had begun the day before. He reported having felt un­
usually fatigued over several days. Clinical examination 
showed the patient to be lethargic but having no abnormal 
neurologic signs. 
Laboratory testing at admission revealed a normal leu­
kocyte count of 6.8 × 109 cells/L and a moderately elevated 
C-reactive protein level of 63.2 mg/L. A urine sediment test, 
a chest radiograph, and an abdominal ultrasound revealed 
no signs of disease. Treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate 
was started, and blood and urine samples for cultures were 
collected. After 5 days, the patient was transferred to the 
intensive care unit because of increasing lethargy, followed 
by loss of consciousness, and clinical and biochemical 
signs of multiple organ failure. He was intubated and his 
treatment changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and clarithro­
mycin; new cultures were also performed. Fever persisted, 
and the patient developed pancytopenia (leukocytes 1.68 
× 109 cells/L; hemoglobin 8.6 g/dL; platelets 61 × 109/L). 
Because kidney function deteriorated further, continu­
ous venovenous ultrafiltration hemodialysis was begun. 
An electroencephalogram exam showed delayed response 
without signs of epilepsy. A cranial computed tomography 
scan showed no signs of acute disease, and autoimmune 
screening did not reveal any abnormalities. 
The results from a multiplex PCR (RespiFinder22; 
PathoFinder, Maastricht, the Netherlands), performed on 
a broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample, were negative 
for 22 different respiratory pathogens. The result from a 
singleplex PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was neg­
ative. Test results from immunofluorescence and PCR for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii were also negative. Cerebrospinal 
fluid testing revealed an elevated pH of 7.95, elevated 
total protein of 79 mg/dL, normal glucose of 65 mg/dL, 
slightly increased leukocytosis of 7/mm3, and elevated 
erythrocytes of 370/mm3. Results were negative for mo­
lecular diagnostics of cerebrospinal fluid for 13 pathogens 
Figure. Alignments of complete 
WNV genome identified from 
patient in Belgium compared 
with 32 known reference strains 
from the 5 established WNV 
lineages. A phylogenetic tree 
was constructed using the 
maximum-likelihood method 
based on the Tamura-Nei 
model. Evolutionary analyses 
were conducted in MEGA7 
(http://www.megasoftware.
net). Bootstrapping was 
conducted with 1,000 bootstrap 
replicates; only bootstrap values 
over 70% are shown. The 
phylogenetic tree clusters the 
strain from this patient together 
with other WNV strains from 
southeastern Europe in lineage 
II. The patient isolate, named 
WNV-2|Belgium|2017|Antwerp 
(GenBank accession no. 
MH021189), is most similar to a 
strain from Hungary. GenBank 
accession numbers are provided

and serology testing for 12 pathogens. Results from viral 
cultures on a BAL sample, taken 8 days after hospital ad­
mission, showed a cytopathogenic effect on 3 available 
cell lines (Vero, HEp-2, and MRC5) 7 days after incu­
bation. Results from a PCR, administered in an effort to 
identify the positive viral culture, for herpes simplex virus 
and enterovirus were both negative.
Because the general condition of the patient had im­
proved and stabilized, he was weaned from intubation 14 
days after admission to the intensive care unit. He was 
discharged to the geriatric department and slowly recov­
ered consciousness; his neurologic status also normalized. 
Three months after onset of the infection, the patient de­
scribed having some memory loss and no memory at all of 
the days when the infection first started.
Because routine testing did not lead to a diagnosis, a 
BAL sample and a viral culture were sent to the Univer­
sity Hospital Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). The cell culture 
was subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) with 
the Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes protocol (5). 
This protocol includes purification of viral particles, nu­
cleic acid extraction, and random PCR amplification, fol­
lowed by library preparation and sequencing using Next­
Seq 500 system NGS technology (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA, USA) (6). The sequence reads obtained were filtered 
and trimmed, de novo assembled, and taxonomically clas­
sified (7,8). Analysis of the NGS results identified a com­
plete West Nile virus genome (11,060 nt). To confirm this 
result, a novel RNA extraction and a reverse transcrip­
tion PCR (QIAGEN, Venlo, the Netherlands) with newly 
developed primers were performed on the BAL sample 
and cell culture, followed by Sanger sequencing (9). The 
sequence obtained from the positive sample was identi­
cal to the sequence from the complete genome obtained 
by NGS. 
The WNV lineage 2 strain in this study, WNV-
2|Belgium|2017|Antwerp (GenBank accession number: 
MH021189), is closely related (99.4%–99.6% nucleotide 
similarity) to a strain from Hungary and other Balkan coun­
tries identified between 2010 and 2015 (Figure), reinforc­
ing the conclusion that this WNV infection was acquired 
in Hungary. This case illustrates that the combined use of 
cell cultures and NGS can be a powerful tool for identify­
ing unknown pathogens in clinical specimens when results 
from routine tests are negative and the patient’s condition 
is undiagnosed.

We report a disseminated infection caused by Spiroplasma 
apis, a honeybee pathogen, in a patient in France who had 
X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Identification was challeng­
ing because initial bacterial cultures and direct examination 
by Gram staining were negative. Unexplained sepsis in pa­
tients with agammaglobulinemia warrants specific investiga­
tion to identify fastidious bacteria such as Spiroplasma spp.
I
n February 2017, a 40-year-old man in France who was 
under immunoglobulin replacement therapy for X-linked 
agammaglobulinemia experienced a migrating nonitchy pap­
ular eruption. Skin biopsy revealed nonspecific lymphocytic 
dermatitis. One month later, he experienced distal interpha­
langeal arthritis. Histology of a synovial biopsy sample found 
a nonspecific lymphocytic infiltrate. Bacterial cultures were 
negative. In April 2017, febrile arthritis of the left ankle and 
right knee appeared, along with bilateral wrist and finger te­
nosynovitis (online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.
gov/EID/article/24/12/18-0567-Techapp1.pdf). We initiated 
ceftriaxone (1 g/d) and performed a left ankle joint aspiration 
24 hours later. The patient remained febrile with a pulmonary 
valve murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and purpuric lesions, 
tenosynovitis in the left ankle and both wrists, and right knee 
and interphalangeal polyarthritis. Serum C-reactive protein 
was 136 mg/dL and IgG serum level 9.4 g/L. Transesopha­
geal echography showed slight tricuspid regurgitation. Arthri­
tis worsened, and we performed a right knee joint aspiration. 
Four of 6 blood cultures were positive after 55 h of incuba­
tion at 37°C (Bactec FX; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ, USA). Results of direct examination by Gram staining of 
positive blood cultures and real-time multiplex PCR for blood 
culture identification (FilmArray BCID Panel; bioMérieux, 
Marcy l’Etoile, France) were negative. Small α-hemolytic ar­
eas appeared on subcultures in horse blood agar after 5 days 
of aerobic culture; results of mass spectrometry performed on 
these areas were negative. Blood culture–specific PCR tar­
geting Tropheryma whipplei, Bartonella spp., Brucella spp., 
Coxiella burnetii, and Rickettsia spp. showed negative results. 
At this stage, we modified antimicrobial therapy to be 
optimal for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, deficient streptococci, 
Campylobacter, and Helicobacter regarding the context of 
agammaglobulinemia. We introduced amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid (12 g/1,200 mg/d) associated with levofloxacin (500 mg 
2×/d), leading to apyrexia and negative blood culture after 1 
day. Results of testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (by PCR 
and culture) and Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis 
(by culture) in urine were negative. We seeded synovial flu­
id on blood culture, and small colonies developed on horse 
blood agar. We extracted DNA from the zone of hemolysis us­
ing EZ1 DNA tissue kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). We 
amplified and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene with the primer 
set 27F/16S1RRB as previously described (1) and performed 
bacterial identification using phylogenic analysis on the Bioin­
formatics Bacterial Identification tool (2). The 491-bp ampli­
con sequence was 100% identical to that of Spiroplasma apis 
strain ATCC 33834 (GenBank accession no. GU993267). We 
confirmed identification of S. apis by specific S. apis PCR (3) 
and culture (on modified SP4 agar) in synovial fluid from left 
ankle and right knee and in blood culture. Direct examination 
of synovial fluid and blood culture with dark field microscopy 
allowed identification of bacteria with a helical morphology 
and motility evocative of spiroplasmas (Figure). We obtained 
highly enriched Spiroplasma cultures starting from fluid and 
blood cultures. We retrospectively found specific PCR for S. 
apis positive in synovial biopsy from the distal interphalan­
geal sample. Antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing showed 
susceptibility to macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquino­
lones and resistance to rifampin, cotrimoxazole, and penicillin 
G. Tetracycline and fluoroquinolone MIC values were similar 
to those reported for Ureaplasma spp.
Patient’s condition gradually improved with 6-week ad­
ministration of levofloxacin and iterative joint aspirations of 
the right knee. Because of severe tendinopathy, levofloxa­
cin was stopped after 6 weeks and replaced by azithromycin 
(500 mg/d) and doxycycline (200 mg 2×/d) for 6 weeks.
Patients with agammaglobulinemia are susceptible to 
infections, including mycoplasma infections (4). Invasive 
infections such as endocarditis and septic arthritis have 
been reported with M. hominis and Ureaplasma urealyti­
cum in hypogammaglobulinemic patients. Of note, our pa­
tient contracted mycoplasma infection despite an appropri­
ate gammaglobulin serum level (IgG 9.4 g/L). 
Spiroplasmas, arthropod-infecting bacteria of the class 
Mollicutes, are similar to mycoplasmas. Pathogenic species 
include S. apis, detected in hives in southwestern France (5). 
S. apis is associated with the lethal May disease of the Euro­
pean honeybee Apis mellifera. Its prevalence in bee colonies 
in France was not reported but was recently shown to reach 
high percentages in other countries (6). Only 3 cases of hu­
man infection due to Spiroplasma spp. have been reported: 
hepatitis in a lung transplant recipient (7), uveitis in a pre­
mature neonate (8), and bacteremia in a patient under cer­
tolizumab treatment (9). None of these infections correlated 
with any noticeable insect bite history. In contrast, the patient 
we report had multiple stings by a flying insect resembling 
a hornet in August 2016, in the Loiret department of France, 
leading to cutaneous blebs and transitory rash. This finding 
raises the possibility that S. apis might infect insects other

than honeybees. The insect stings in this patient are a likely 
gateway of the reported infection.
In summary, clinicians and microbiologists should be 
aware of fastidious organisms in atypical infections in im­
munocompromised patients. Our findings indicate a need 
for prolonged culture on specific agar on all joint fluids in 
patients with agammaglobulinemia and targeted molecular 
methods to identify S. apis organisms.

RESEARCH LETTERS
Elucidating the emergence of Mycoplasma ovipneumoni­
ae–associated respiratory disease in ruminants requires 
identification of the pathogen host range. This bacterium 
was thought to be host restricted to subfamily Caprinae, but 
we describe its identification in healthy moose, caribou, and 
mule deer and diseased mule and white-tailed deer, all spe­
cies in subfamily Capreolinae.
M
ycoplasma 
ovipneumoniae 
was 
identified 
in 
Queensland, Australia, in 1972 as an infectious agent 
associated with pneumonia in domestic sheep (Ovis aries) 
(1). Since then, it has most frequently been identified in 
healthy and diseased domestic sheep, domestic goats (Cap­
ra aegagrus hircus), and bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). 
Although M. ovipneumoniae was identified in respiratory 
disease outbreaks in bighorn sheep as early as 1980 (2), 
the past decade has brought it under scrutiny because of 
evidence supporting its association with bighorn sheep 
pneumonia in western North America (3). Because most 
reports have described this bacterium in sheep and goats, 
and fewer in muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) (4), some have 
concluded that M. ovipneumoniae is specific to the subfam­
ily Caprinae (5) or has a host range limited to Caprinae 
(6), despite publications describing M. ovipneumoniae in 
non-Caprinae species, including Beira antelope (Dorcatra­
gus megalotis) with respiratory disease in Qatar (7) and in 
9 cattle (Bos taurus) in Colorado, USA (8). Unfortunately, 
description of the method(s) used to identify M. ovipneu­
moniae in those reports was limited to stating the use of 
PCR with no supporting sequence data.
In general, definitive claims of host range restrictions 
are absent from mycoplasma literature, because “assump­
tions about restricted host range of mycoplasmas, based on 
the host from which they were first or frequently isolated, 
are usually made in the context of nearly complete absence 
of representative sampling of the vast majority of potential 
vertebrate hosts” (9). In addition to insufficient sampling 
of potential hosts, the fastidious and variably culturable 
nature of M. ovipneumoniae often requires molecular tech­
niques for identification. We used molecular techniques to 
analyze multiple species from the subfamily Capreolinae 
for the presence of M. ovipneumoniae.
During July 2017–January 2018, the US Department 
of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service in Pullman, 
WA, USA, received nasal swab samples from 230 moose 
(Alces alces) and 243 caribou (Rangifer tarandus) from 
Alaska and 5 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) from Ari­
zona (online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/
EID/article/24/12/18-0632-Techapp1.pdf). Also received in 
February 2018 was an isolate of M. ovipneumoniae that had 
been cultured by Newport Laboratories (Worthington, MN, 
USA) from lung tissue from a white-tailed deer (Odocoi­
leus virginianus) that died during a pneumonia outbreak at 
a captive facility in the upper Midwest region of the United 
States in 2016. We extracted DNA from swab samples and 
from the white-tailed deer isolate, performed PCR using 
a modified published PCR method (10) to amplify part of 
the 16S rRNA gene, and sequenced amplicons of the cor­
rect size (online Technical Appendix). Forward and reverse 
sequences were merged, manually inspected for errors, and 
trimmed to 290 bp using Sequencher 5.2.2 (Gene Codes, 
Ann Arbor, MI, USA) corresponding to a 103–392-bp re­
gion of the 16S rRNA gene of type strain Y98 obtained 
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, 
VA, USA). Sequences were blastn queried (https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and identified as M. ovipneu­
moniae at 100% coverage and ≥97% identity to Y98 (Gen­
Bank accession no. NR_025989.1). The analyzed region 
represents the most divergent region of the 16S rRNA gene 
among strains of M. ovipneumoniae and between Myco­
plasma spp. of the highest percentage identity to M. ovi­
pneumoniae (online Technical Appendix).
We detected M. ovipneumoniae in 6 moose (2.6%), 
including 3 from 2 captive facilities and 3 free-ranging; 
5 free-ranging caribou (2.1%); and 2 of 5 mule deer, 1 of 
which was coughing and had nasal discharge at the time of 
sample collection. The identity of the lung isolate, cultured 
from the white-tailed deer that had died from pneumonia, 
was confirmed as M. ovipneumoniae. For sequence com­
parison, we generated a percent identity matrix with the M. 
ovipneumoniae sequences from the Capreolinae species, 
nasal swabs collected from 2 healthy M. ovipneumoniae–
positive wild sheep (online Technical Appendix), Y98, 
and bacteria of the closest identity to Y98 and sequences 
generated in this study based on blastn queries (M. dispar, 
M. hyopneumoniae, and M. flocculare) (online Technical 
Appendix). The percent identity matrix revealed 2 group­
ings of M. ovipneumoniae and illustrates the divergence 
from the other Mycoplasma spp. of closest identity to M. 
ovipneumoniae. Sample sequences have been submitted to 
GenBank (online Technical Appendix).
This report describes M. ovipneumoniae carriage in 
multiple members of the subfamily Capreolinae (moose, 
caribou, and mule deer), and emergence of M. ovipneu­
moniae–associated respiratory disease in deer. These find­
ings are of importance to epidemiologic investigations 
because current dogma regarding host specificity may dis­
suade laboratories from pursuing identification of this fas­
tidious bacterium in hosts beyond the subfamily Caprinae. 
Improved diagnostic methods to increase detection sensi­
tivity are warranted based on information provided in this 
report (online Technical Appendix). Full-length genome 
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of M. ovipneumoni­
ae isolates are necessary next steps in inferring evolution­
ary relationships and origin of this bacterium in identified 
host species.

Leptospirosis is found worldwide, except in northern re­
gions. We report a case associated with a backcountry 
adventure race in Manitoba, Canada. Initially, nonspecific 
symptomatology and diagnostic pitfalls contributed to a de­
lay in identification. Careful attention needs to be paid to 
exposure to and risk for leptospirosis in northern and tem­
perate climates.
L
eptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospi­
ra interrogans (motile bacterial spirochetes). Human 
transmission occurs by direct contact with contaminated 
urine or animals (1). The organism has a worldwide dis­
tribution outside of polar regions and is common during 
the rainy season in tropical and temperate climates (2).

Occupational exposure is a reported risk factor in dis­
ease-endemic areas (3). Other risk factors are recreation­
al exposure to water in temperate and tropical settings, 
walking barefoot through surface water, contact with 
wild rodents, and accidental laboratory exposure (3). 
Cases of leptospirosis have been identified at adventure 
races (4,5).
Leptospirosis is not reported nationally in Canada or 
the United States. In the United States, 150–200 hospital 
admissions for leptospirosis were reported annually during 
1998–2000 (6). In Canada, only 25 cases with supportive 
diagnostic results and 36 confirmed cases overall have been 
observed by the National Microbiology Laboratory (Win­
nipeg, Manitoba, Canada), which performs testing nation­
ally (Table). In most instances, it is unclear whether these 
cases were acquired locally or abroad. We report a case of 
leptospirosis associated with a backcountry adventure race 
in Manitoba.
In October 2016, a 20-year-old man came to an emer­
gency department in Winnipeg with a 7-day history of fe­
ver, dyspnea, cough, pleuritic chest pain, myalgias, sweats, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These signs and symptoms 
had improved 1–2 days before admission. Rapid deteriora­
tion of the condition of the patient and progressive dyspnea 
and hypoxia were the reasons for his coming to the emer­
gency department.
A complete blood count showed a leukocyte count 
of 12.1 × 109 cells/L (reference range 4.5× 109–11 × 109 
cells/L), 84% neutrophils, and a platelet count of 34 × 109/L 
(reference range 140 × 109–440 × 109 /L). Hemoglobin lev­
el was within the reference range. Aspartate aminotrans­
ferase level was 70 U/L (reference range 10 U/L–32 U/L), 
alanine aminotransferase level 80 U/L (reference value <30 
U/L), alkaline phosphatase level 144 U/L (reference range 
30 U/L–120 U/L), total bilirubin level 23 µmol/L (refer­
ence range 5 µmol/L–21 µmol/L), and direct bilirubin level 
13 µmol/L (reference value <7.0 µmol/L).
Blood smear and culture results were negative for bac­
teria and fungal elements. The patient had a urea level of 
13.6 mmol/L (reference range 2.5 mmol/L–7.1 mmol/L) 
and a creatinine level of 118 µmol/L (reference range 44 
µmol/L–106 µmol/L). Results of urinalysis were within ref­
erence limits. Computed tomography of the abdomen and 
chest showed hepatosplenomegaly, nephromegaly, multifo­
cal and subpleural nodular airspace opacities bilaterally with 
early cavitation, and a small left pleural effusion. There was 
no evidence of alveolar hemorrhage by imaging.
Within 12 hours, progressive hypoxemia developed; the 
patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. He was 
given 2 doses of ceftriaxone initially, which was changed 
to meropenem. The patient also received vancomycin, cip­
rofloxacin, and liposomal amphotericin B for treatment of 
possible infection with Blastomyces gilchristii. A chest drain 
was inserted, and 1.5 L of serosanguinous exudative fluid 
was drained. Culture of pleural and bronchoalveolar fluid did 
not show pathogenic bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungi; PCR 
results for common respiratory viruses were negative.
Over the next 10 days, the patient’s condition im­
proved and he was extubated. Antimicrobial drugs were 
discontinued, amphotericin was replaced by oral itracon­
azole, and he was discharged. An IgM ELISA for lepto­
spirosis performed 5 days after admission showed a posi­
tive result. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) antibody 
titers for L. interrogans were 1:400 for serovar Australis 
and 1:100 for serovar Canicola. No appropriate clinical 
samples were available for retrospective confirmatory 
PCR testing. Itraconazole was discontinued at follow-up, 
20 days after discharge.
Ten weeks after admission, the patient remained clini­
cally asymptomatic, and results of a chest radiograph were 
uneventful. Serologic analysis showed persistently posi­
tive Leptospira IgM titers but negative MAT titers for all 
serovars. Repeat ultrasound of the abdomen showed near 
resolution of the organomegaly.

RESEARCH LETTERS
We retrospectively identified a possible exposure 
10 days before admission: the patient had participated in 
a 9-hour adventure race in the Whiteshell area of south­
eastern Manitoba. The patient trekked, biked, and paddled 
through swamps, bogs, and rivers and reported ingesting 
murky groundwater at various points during the race.
The Whiteshell area is predominantly a nature conser­
vancy and home of many mammals. Most veterinary stud­
ies have focused on prevalence of leptospirosis in wildlife 
species in specific and limited geographic areas. Leptospi­
rosis has been detected in beavers, coyotes, deer, foxes, 
opossums, and otters in Canada and is especially prevalent 
in raccoons and skunks in urban and rural environments 
(8,9). There are limited published data on endemic lepto­
spirosis in Canada, but sylvatic exposures have been re­
ported among hunters, trappers, and indigenous peoples; 
the most northern exposure was identified in the Nunavik 
region of Quebec (10).
We report a case of endemically acquired leptospiro­
sis, detected by using supportive laboratory evidence, from 
an adventure racer in western Canada. As the popularity 
of these events increases, clinicians should be vigilant for 
this life-threatening infection in regions not normally con­
sidered endemic for this disease. Early diagnosis of lepto­
spirosis based on clinical features and exposure history in 
temperate and tropical climates should be considered. For 
suspected cases, an acute-phase serum sample should be 
collected for serologic testing by IgM ELISA and MAT. 
Urine or blood should be collected before treatment for 
PCR testing, followed by convalescent-phase serologic 
analysis where applicable to assist diagnosis. In addition, 
appropriate therapy with intravenous penicillin or ceftriax­
one should be initiated empirically for severe disease.

“N
o other nation in the world looks forward to an 
icy season the way the Dutch do,” wrote Wim 
Pijbes and Earl A. Powell III in the preface to Hendrick 
Avercamp: Master of the Ice Scene. Wintery weather pre­
dominated across most of Europe during the Little Ice Age, 
which started around 1300 and lasted for about 350 years. 
The atypically cold, harsh weather affected agriculture, 
health, commerce, emigration, and social stability, precipi­
tating unrest, revolt, warfare, and migration. Throughout 
this time, epidemics of plague flared across Europe, and 
malaria persisted despite frigid conditions. 
The coldest period of the Little Ice Age roughly over­
lapped the 90 years of the Dutch Golden Age. Unlike most 
of Europe, the Dutch Republic, which preceded the Neth­
erlands of today, thrived during the icy 17th century. De­
spite its small size and limited natural resources, the coun­
try achieved stability and prosperity, chiefly because of its 
unmatched commercial fishing and trading fleets and its 
agricultural practices. That confluence of “political, eco­
nomic, religious, and social circumstances created a unique 
and fruitful climate for the arts,” according to the National 
Gallery of Art, which also notes, “A remarkable number of

ABOUT THE COVER
pictures of extraordinary quality were produced during the 
Dutch Golden Age.” 
Perhaps less known than some of his contemporaries, 
Hendrick Avercamp is nonetheless considered to be among 
the great masters of that time. Avercamp painted vibrant, 
detailed winter landscapes during the first third of the 17th 
century. The United Sates National Gallery of Art states 
that he “did not invent the winter landscape, but he was the 
first artist to specialize in this quintessential Dutch subject.” 
Details of Avercamp’s life are sparse. He was born in 
Amsterdam in 1585, though the next year his family re­
located to the smaller city of Kampen. His father, Barent, 
served as the town apothecary and later as its doctor until 
he died of the plague in 1602. His first art teacher and one 
of his brothers also died of the plague during that frigid 
17th century. 
Apparently, Avercamp could not speak and was known 
as “the Mute of Kampen.” He came from a learned fam­
ily: his father and brothers were physicians and apothecar­
ies, and his grandfather and uncle were headmasters of a 
prestigious Latin school. Avercamp probably lived in the 
house that his mother Beatrix owned. Art historian Arthur 
K. Wheelock Jr. observed that “There, in relative isolation 
from the mainstreams of Dutch art, he devoted himself al­
most entirely to the painting of winter scenes and specifi­
cally to depictions of crowds of people engaging in a wide 
range of activities on frozen rivers.” In total, Avercamp 
produced about a hundred paintings of winter scenes.
Avercamp completed Winter Landscape with Ice Skat­
ers, this month’s cover art, following the exceptionally frig­
id winter of 1607–1608. The painting, which is his largest 
known work, reveals an icy fog cloaking the winter sun and 
the edges of the village. A stark filigree of bare tree limbs 
claws toward the winter sky. The artist achieved an impres­
sion of depth by fading colors and blurring shapes in the 
distance. His placement of buildings and trees that flank the 
frozen canal also guides viewers toward the misty horizon. 
Pieter Roelofs, a curator at Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, ob­
serves that Avercamp’s use of vantage points and perspective 
served to “create a more natural space so that the viewer is 
involved more directly in the events on and around the ice.” 
The Rijksmuseum offers additional details: “The high 
vantage point of this painting turns it into a sampler of 
human―and animal―activity during a harsh winter. 
Hundreds of people are out on the ice, most of them for 
pleasure, others working out of dire necessity.” A crowd 
of busy figures is scattered across the canvas. Among the 
working class, a beggar seeks bread, an angler balances a 
long trident and grips the day’s catch, and a brewery worker 
fetches water from a hole cut into the ice. Knots of people 
conversing, couples skating, and sportsmen playing kolf on 
the ice (a hybrid golf and hockey) reveal that for many oth­
ers this is a day for recreation and socializing. 
Animals scattered throughout the painting include sev­
eral horses pulling sledges; birds hovering in the silvery air 
or clinging to bare branches or sloping rooftops; domesti­
cated fowl pecking for food; and a dog scampering over the 
ice. Roelofs notes, “Avercamp did not concentrate solely 
on winter fun and games and the sunny side of the cold sea­
son.” For example, he placed crows and a dog feasting on a 
horse carcass in the foreground of this painting. 
Environmental history professor Dagomar Degroot 
comments on the Little Ice Age: “Changing weather pat­
terns altered the range of insects that carried pathogens, 
bringing new and deadly ailments to the previously unex­
posed. Because malnourished bodies have weak immune 
systems, farmers and their livestock soon fell sick. Refu­
gees from the famine-stricken countryside spread disease 
to cities, where epidemic outbreaks often inflicted a fear­
some toll.” Winter Landscape with Ice Skaters provides a 
glimpse of village life during Europe’s Little Ice Age and 
may stimulate viewers to consider the interrelationship of 
climate and human, animal, and environmental health.

Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 24, No. 12, December 2018
1. You are advising a public health department in 
California regarding potential needs for St. Louis 
encephalitis virus (SLEV) detection and management. 
On the basis of the epidemiological review by Diaz 
and colleagues, which one of the following statements 
about the history of SLEV epidemiology in the United 
States is correct? 
A. 	 SLEV was first identified as the causative agent of a 
mosquito-borne viral epidemic in St. Louis, Missouri, 
during the summer of 1953
B. 	 SLEV activity increased considerably in the United 
States after West Nile virus introduction in 1999
C. 	 SLEV genotypes IV and V are most prevalent in the 
United States
D. 	 SLEV is transmitted by numerous Culex mosquito 
species, and is amplified by passerine and 
columbiform avian species
2. According to the epidemiological review by Diaz 
and colleagues, which one of the following statements 
about the emergence and reemergence of SLEV in 
South America is correct?
A. 	 Introduction of a more pathogenic strain and 
increasing populations of the eared dove as amplifying 
host led to the emergence of SLEV in Argentina
B. 	 Human SLE epidemics have occurred every 2 to 3 
years in Latin America since the 1980s
C. 	 The 2005 outbreak of SLE in Córdoba City had worse 
outcomes in younger patients
D. 	 SLEV strains isolated during the 2005 outbreak were 
closely related to a genotype V SLEV strain
3. On the basis of the epidemiological review by Diaz 
and colleagues, which one of the following statements 
about reemergence of SLEV in the western United 
States is correct? 
A. 	 In 2014 to 2015, SLEV caused a human outbreak in 
New Mexico 
B. 	 Emerging SLEV in the western United States is 
related to the strains isolated during sporadic 
transmission in Florida in 1993 and 1997
C. 	 Reemerging SLEV in the western United States may 
have been mediated via migrating infected birds from 
southern South America, where it reemerged most 
recently in 2002
D. 	 Longitudinal SLEV isolates from California were 
genetically similar from 1952 through 2015

Summary of Authors’ Instructions
Authors’ Instructions. For a complete list of EID’s manuscript guidelines, see the 
author resource page: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/page/author-resource-center. 
Manuscript Submission. To submit a manuscript, access Manuscript Central from 
the Emerging Infectious Diseases web page (www.cdc.gov/eid). Include a cover letter 
indicating the proposed category of the article (e.g., Research, Dispatch), verifying the 
word and reference counts, and confirming that the final manuscript has been seen and 
approved by all authors. Complete provided Authors Checklist. 
Manuscript Preparation. For word processing, use MS Word. Set the document 
to show continuous line numbers. List the following information in this order: title page, 
article summary line, keywords, abstract, text, acknowledgments, biographical sketch, 
references, tables, and figure legends. Appendix materials and figures should be in 
separate files. 
Title Page. Give complete information about each author (i.e., full name, graduate 
degree(s), affiliation, and the name of the institution in which the work was done). Clearly 
identify the corresponding author and provide that author’s mailing address (include phone 
number, fax number, and email address). Include separate word counts for abstract and text. 
Keywords. Use terms as listed in the National Library of Medicine Medical 
Subject Headings index (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh).
Text. Double-space everything, including the title page, abstract, references, tables, 
and figure legends. Indent paragraphs; leave no extra space between paragraphs. After 
a period, leave only one space before beginning the next sentence. Use 12-point Times 
New Roman font and format with ragged right margins (left align). Italicize (rather than 
underline) scientific names when needed. 
Biographical Sketch. Include a short biographical sketch of the first author—both 
authors if only two. Include affiliations and the author’s primary research interests. 
References. Follow Uniform Requirements (www.icmje.org/index.html). Do not 
use endnotes for references. Place reference numbers in parentheses, not super­
scripts. Number citations in order of appearance (including in text, figures, and tables). 
Cite personal communications, unpublished data, and manuscripts in preparation or 
submitted for publication in parentheses in text. Consult List of Journals Indexed in 
Index Medicus for accepted journal abbreviations; if a journal is not listed, spell out 
the journal title. List the first six authors followed by “et al.” Do not cite references in 
the abstract.
Tables. Provide tables within the manuscript file, not as separate files. Use the MS 
Word table tool, no columns, tabs, spaces, or other programs. Footnote any use of bold­
face. Tables should be no wider than 17 cm. Condense or divide larger tables. Extensive 
tables may be made available online only.  
Figures.  Submit editable figures as separate files (e.g., Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint).  
Photographs should be submitted as high-resolution (600 dpi) .tif or .jpg files. Do not embed 
figures in the manuscript file. Use Arial 10 pt. or 12 pt. font for lettering so that figures, sym­
bols, lettering, and numbering can remain legible when reduced to print size. Place figure 
keys within the figure. Figure legends should be placed at the end of the manuscript file.
Videos. Submit as AVI, MOV, MPG, MPEG, or WMV. Videos should not exceed 5 
minutes and should include an audio description and complete captioning. If audio is 
not available, provide a description of the action in the video as a separate Word file. 
Published or copyrighted material (e.g., music) is discouraged and must be accompanied 
by written release. If video is part of a manuscript, files must be uploaded with manu­
script submission. When uploading, choose “Video” file. Include a brief video legend in 
the manuscript file.
Types of Articles
Perspectives. Articles should not exceed 3,500 words and 50 references. Use of 
subheadings in the main body of the text is recommended. Photographs and illustra­
tions are encouraged. Provide a short abstract (150 words), 1-sentence summary, and 
biographical sketch. Articles should provide insightful analysis and commentary about 
new and reemerging infectious diseases and related issues. Perspectives may address 
factors known to influence the emergence of diseases, including microbial adaptation and 
change, human demographics and behavior, technology and industry, economic devel­
opment and land use, international travel and commerce, and the breakdown of public 
health measures.  
Synopses. Articles should not exceed 3,500 words in the main body of the text 
or include more than 50 references. Use of subheadings in the main body of the 
text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are encouraged. Provide a short 
abstract (not to exceed 150 words), a 1-line summary of the conclusions, and a brief 
biographical sketch of first author or of both authors if only 2 authors. This section 
comprises case series papers and concise reviews of infectious diseases or closely 
related topics. Preference is given to reviews of new and emerging diseases; how­
ever, timely updates of other diseases or topics are also welcome.  If detailed methods 
are included, a separate section on experimental procedures should immediately fol­
low the body of the text.
Research. Articles should not exceed 3,500 words and 50 references. Use of sub­
headings in the main body of the text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are 
encouraged. Provide a short abstract (150 words), 1-sentence summary, and biographical 
sketch. Report laboratory and epidemiologic results within a public health perspective. 
Explain the value of the research in public health terms and place the findings in a larger 
perspective (i.e., “Here is what we found, and here is what the findings mean”).
Policy and Historical Reviews. Articles should not exceed 3,500 words and 50 refer­
ences. Use of subheadings in the main body of the text is recommended. Photographs 
and illustrations are encouraged. Provide a short abstract (150 words), 1-sentence sum­
mary, and biographical sketch. Articles in this section include public health policy or his­
torical reports that are based on research and analysis of emerging disease issues.
Dispatches. Articles should be no more than 1,200 words and need not be divided 
into sections. If subheadings are used, they should be general, e.g., “The Study” and 
“Conclusions.” Provide a brief abstract (50 words); references (not to exceed 15); figures 
or illustrations (not to exceed 2); tables (not to exceed 2); and biographical sketch. Dis­
patches are updates on infectious disease trends and research that include descriptions 
of new methods for detecting, characterizing, or subtyping new or reemerging pathogens. 
Developments in antimicrobial drugs, vaccines, or infectious disease prevention or elimi­
nation programs are appropriate. Case reports are also welcome.
Research Letters Reporting Cases, Outbreaks, or Original Research. EID 
publishes letters that report cases, outbreaks, or original research as Research Letters. 
Authors should provide a short abstract (50-word maximum), references (not to exceed 
10), and a short biographical sketch. These letters should not exceed 800 words in the 
main body of the text and may include either 1 figure or 1 table. Do not divide Research 
Letters into sections.
Letters Commenting on Articles. Letters commenting on articles should contain a 
maximum of 300 words and 5 references; they are more likely to be published if submitted 
within 4 weeks of the original article’s publication.
Commentaries. Thoughtful discussions (500–1,000 words) of current topics. 
Commentaries may contain references (not to exceed 15) but no abstract, figures, or 
tables. Include biographical sketch.
Another Dimension. Thoughtful essays, short stories, or poems on philosophical 
issues related to science, medical practice, and human health. Topics may include sci­
ence and the human condition, the unanticipated side of epidemic investigations, or how 
people perceive and cope with infection and illness. This section is intended to evoke 
compassion for human suffering and to expand the science reader’s literary scope. 
Manuscripts are selected for publication as much for their content (the experiences they 
describe) as for their literary merit. Include biographical sketch.
Books, Other Media. Reviews (250–500 words) of new books or other media on 
emerging disease issues are welcome. Title, author(s), publisher, number of pages, and 
other pertinent details should be included.
Conference Summaries. Summaries of emerging infectious disease conference ac­
tivities (500–1,000 words) are published online only. They should be submitted no later 
than 6 months after the conference and focus on content rather than process. Provide 
illustrations, references, and links to full reports of conference activities.
Online Reports. Reports on consensus group meetings, workshops, and other ac­
tivities in which suggestions for diagnostic, treatment, or reporting methods related to 
infectious disease topics are formulated may be published online only. These should not 
exceed 3,500 words and should be authored by the group. We do not publish official 
guidelines or policy recommendations.
Photo Quiz. The photo quiz (1,200 words) highlights a person who made notable 
contributions to public health and medicine. Provide a photo of the subject, a brief clue 
to the person’s identity, and five possible answers, followed by an essay describing the 
person’s life and his or her significance to public health, science, and infectious disease. 
Etymologia. Etymologia (100 words, 5 references). We welcome thoroughly researched 
derivations of emerging disease terms. Historical and other context could be included. 
Announcements. We welcome brief announcements of timely events of interest to 
our readers. Announcements may be posted online only, depending on the event date. 
Email to eideditor@cdc.gov.
