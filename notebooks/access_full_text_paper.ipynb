       "['Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are proteases that\\ncleave specific cellular proteins essential for neurotransmit-\\nter release. Seven BoNT serotypes (A–G) exist; 4 usually\\ncause human botulism (A, B, E, and F). We developed a\\nrapid, mass spectrometry–based method (Endopep-MS) to\\ndetect and differentiate active BoNTs A, B, E, and F. This\\nmethod uses the highly specific protease activity of the tox-\\nins with target peptides specific for each toxin serotype.\\nThe product peptides derived from the endopeptidase\\nactivities of BoNTs are detected by matrix-assisted laser-\\ndesorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In\\nbuffer, this method can detect toxin equivalents of as little\\nas 0.01 mouse lethal dose (MLD)50 and concentrations as\\nlow as 0.62 MLD50/mL. A high-performance liquid chro-\\nmatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for quan-\\ntifying active toxin, where the amount of toxin can be\\ncorrelated to the amount of product peptides, is also\\ndescribed.\\nB\\notulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most toxic sub-\\nstances known (1). They are produced under anaero-\\nbic conditions by strains of Clostridium botulinum, C.\\nbutyricum, and C. baratii (1). Intoxication with 1 of the 7\\ndistinct serotypes of BoNT (A–G) causes botulism. One of\\n4 serotypes of BoNT (A, B, E, and F) is usually the cause\\nof botulism in humans. BoNTs are zinc metalloproteases\\nthat cleave and inactivate specific cellular proteins essen-\\ntial for the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine\\n(Figure 1). BoNT-A, -C, and -E cleave SNAP (synaptoso-\\nmal-associated protein)-25; BoNT-B, -D, -F, and -G cleave\\nsynaptobrevin 2 (also called VAMP 2). Of the serotypes,\\nonly 1, BoNT-C, cleaves >1 site on a specific protein. In\\naddition to cleaving SNAP-25, BoNT-C also cleaves syn-\\ntaxin (1).\\nCurrent methods for detecting BoNT include a mouse\\nbioassay (2–4) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\\n(ELISA) (5,6). The mouse bioassay is the accepted stan-\\ndard and is the only widely accepted method for detecting\\nBoNT (2–5). In this assay, mice receiving an intraperitoneal\\ninjection containing a sample with more than a minimum\\nlethal dose show symptoms of botulinum intoxication and\\ndie (2,4). Many institutional animal care and use commit-\\ntees, including that of the Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention, require mice to be euthanized after the onset of\\nsevere symptoms. In the mouse bioassay, when the injected\\ndose is high, mice typically develop signs of botulism with-\\nin 8 hours. At lower doses, mice are affected more slowly;\\nhence, mice are observed for 4 days before a negative result\\nBotulinum Neurotoxin Detection\\nand Differentiation by Mass\\nSpectrometry \\nJohn R.

Mixtures of neutralizing anti-\\nbodies are given to mice in conjunction with the sample.\\nMice receiving the appropriate anti-BoNT serotype anti-\\nbody are asymptomatic and survive, while mice treated\\nwith the other serotype antibodies show symptoms of botu-\\nlism (4). The mouse bioassay measures active toxin and is\\nsensitive. The absolute amount of toxin detected in the\\nmouse bioassay is not well defined but is thought to be\\n10–20 pg/mL for BoNT A (7,8). The main disadvantage of\\nthe mouse bioassay is that it requires euthanizing many ani-\\nmals. It also requires several days to determine the toxin\\nlevel and type (4–6). Special animal facilities are also\\nrequired, personal hazards are associated with injecting ani-\\nmals (5,6), and some clostridia produce nonbotulinal toxins\\nthat also kill mice (5). \\nThe ELISA is more rapid than the mouse bioassay, but\\nit is not a functional assay. It recognizes protein antigenic\\nsites and in general is somewhat less sensitive than the\\nmouse bioassay (5,6). The ELISA was validated for detect-\\ning BoNT produced in cooked meat medium and tryptone\\npeptone glucose yeast extract (TPGY). The test was\\ndesigned to detect and differentiate BoNT serotypes A, B,\\nE, and F in a 1-day test and has the sensitivity of ≈10\\nmouse lethal dose (MLD)50/mL (5,6). In a recent study, the\\nELISA performed well in most laboratories at the 100\\nMLD50/mL and 10,000 MLD50/mL levels (5). In this study,\\nsome cross-reactivity occurred among BoNT cultures and\\nwith nonbotulinum cultures (5). At 100 MLD50/mL, a >7%\\nfalse-negative rate in TPGY was observed; at 10,000\\nMLD50/mL, a 1.5% false-positive rate for BoNT-A and a\\n28.6% false-positive rate for BoNT-F occurred (5). The\\nELISA is currently used primarily as a fast screening tech-\\nnique, and results are verified by the mouse bioassay (5). \\nSeveral in vitro assays have been developed to detect\\nthe activities of the different BoNT serotypes (7–14). This\\napproach has led to methods that are based on the natural\\nsubstrates that are cleaved by the BoNTs and use fluores-\\ncence to detect toxin activity. These types of assays are >2\\norders of magnitude less sensitive than the mouse bioassay\\nand have not been proven for use with environmental,\\nfood, or clinical samples. They are also prone to giving\\nfalse-positive results in samples that contain proteases\\nbecause the specific site of cleavage cannot easily be deter-\\nmined in a fluorescence-based assay (15). Another method\\nthat combines immunoaffinity chromatography with spe-\\ncific antibodies for cleavage products has been successful\\nin detecting BoNT B in some foods at lower detection lim-\\nits than the mouse bioassay (10). \\nWe introduce here the concept and preliminary data on\\na new, rapid, mass spectrometry–based, functional method\\nfor detecting, differentiating, and quantifying 4 BoNT\\nserotypes. This method is based on both the unusual\\nendopeptidase activities of these enzymes and specific\\ndetection of the unique peptide products by mass spec-\\ntrometry (Endopep-MS). Because each BoNT serotype has\\na unique cleavage site on a unique peptide, the mass-spe-\\ncific product peptides detected by mass spectrometry dif-\\nferentiate active BoNT serotypes. Substrate peptides that\\nare specific for each serotype are incubated with BoNT;\\nthen serotype-specific product peptides are detected by\\neither matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-\\nflight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) or by high-\\nperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray\\nionization-tandem \\nmass \\nspectrometry \\n(HPLC-\\nESI/MS/MS). Thus, this method combines the biologic\\nspecificity of the BoNT enzymatic activity with the unpar-\\nalleled detection specificity of mass spectrometry. \\nMethods\\nMaterials\\nBoNT\\ncomplex toxins were purchased from\\nMetabiologics (Madison, WI, USA) and were provided at\\n1 mg/mL total protein in 50 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer,\\npH 5.5. The toxin activities in MLD50/mg protein were 3.6\\n× 107 BoNT-A, 1.6 × 107 BoNT-B, 2.8 × 107 BoNT-E, and\\n5.5 × 107 BoNT-F. All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich\\n(St. Louis, MO, USA), except where indicated. HPLC-\\npurified peptide substrates were synthesized by Los\\nAlamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, NM, USA).\\nFigure 2 shows the peptide sequences used to detect and\\ndifferentiate each BoNT serotype along with the specific\\ncleavage products and their masses. \\nPeptide Cleavage Reactions \\nFor the Endopep-MS method, BoNT serotypes A, B, E,\\nand F endopeptidase activities were determined in 20-µL\\nvolumes of buffer containing 0.05 mol/L Hepes (pH 7.3),\\n25 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 mmol/L ZnCl2, 1\\nmg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the target pep-\\ntides, at 1 nmol each. Specific BoNT serotype complexes\\nwere added at various concentrations and incubated at\\n37ºC from 2 h to 16 h. Control tubes without BoNT were\\nrun at the same time as BoNT cleavage reactions and\\nserved as an analytic blank. The analytic sensitivity of the\\nreaction was tested by diluting the toxin in Hepes reaction\\nbuffer to 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 MLD50/µL. An aliquot\\n(1 µL) of each dilution was added to 19 µL reaction buffer\\ncontaining specific peptides 1–4. \\nMultiplexing Reactions\\nEndopeptidase reactions were multiplexed by adding\\nall 4 peptides (1–4) at 1 nmol each to the reaction buffer\\ndescribed above and incubating for 2 h at 37ºC. Each\\nBoNT serotype was added to separate reaction mixtures.\\nBotulinum Neurotoxin Detection and Differentiation\\nEmerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 11, No. 10, October 2005\\n1579\\nControl tubes with no BoNT were always run at the same\\ntime to serve as an analytic blank. High levels of BoNT\\n(200 ng/20 µL reaction) were used for each serotype to\\nlook for cross-reactivity between any of the BoNT\\nserotypes. No cross-reactivity between the various BoNT\\nserotypes was observed.\\nDetection Limits in MLD50/mL\\nLarger volume reactions were run to test the sensitivity\\nin mouse LD50/mL. BoNT serotype A, B, E, or F complex-\\nes ranging from 100 to 0.31 MLD50 were spiked in 1 mL\\nof deionized water. A 168-µL aliquot was spiked with a\\n10× reaction buffer and peptide solution to yield final con-\\ncentrations identical to those above. The target peptides\\nused for this experiment were the same as above, except\\nminor modification to the BoNT A and B substrate pep-\\ntides were used since they showed slightly more activity\\nthan the previous peptides. These peptides were Biotin-(ε)-\\nKGSNRTRIDEGNQRATR(Nle)LGGK-(ε)-Biotin \\nfor\\nBoNT A and LSELDDRADALQAGASQFESSAAK-\\nLKRKYWWKNLK for BoNT B. The final reaction vol-\\numes were 200 µL. One set of reactions was allowed to\\nproceed for 4 h, and a second set proceeded for 16 h. The\\nlonger reaction times were used to enhance the amount of\\nproduct peptide produced and, therefore, lower the detec-\\ntion limits. For MALDI-TOF analysis, 2 µL of the 200-µL\\nreaction mixture was mixed with the matrix and analyzed\\nas discussed in the MALDI-TOF-MS section. For HPLC-\\nESI/MS/MS analysis, 50 µL of the 200-µL reaction mix-\\nture was injected on the instrument.\\nMALDI-TOF-MS Analysis \\nSpecific cleavage products were detected by mass spec-\\ntrometry. For all experiments, the reaction mixture, at the\\nincubation times indicated, was added to alpha-cyano-4-\\nhydroxy cinnamic acid (CHCA) at 5 mg/mL in 50% ace-\\ntonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1 mmol/L\\nammonium citrate (CHCA matrix), at a ratio of 1:5 or 1:10.\\nThis mixture was applied at 0.5 µL per spot to a 192-spot\\nstainless steel MALDI plate (Applied Biosystems,\\nFramingham, MA, USA). Mass spectra of each spot were\\nobtained by scanning 650–4,500 m/z in MS-positive ion\\nreflectron mode on a Model 4700 MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS\\nProteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The instru-\\nment used a nitrogen laser at 337 nm, and each spectrum\\nwas an average of 2,400 laser shots.\\nHPLC-ESI/MS/MS Analysis\\nThe HPLC-ESI/MS/MS system consisted of an\\nAPI4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a\\nTurboIonSpray interface (Applied Biosystems, Toronto,\\nCanada) and a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) liquid chromato-\\ngraph. We used Luna C18 (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA,\\nUSA) columns (150 mm × 1 mm internal diameter, 5-µm\\nparticles). Solvents were A: H2O with 1% (vol/vol) formic\\nacid and B: 80:20 acetonitrile:H2O plus 1% (vol/vol)\\nformic acid. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of\\n0% to 80% solvent B in 25 min, at 50 µL/min. A parallel\\ncolumn format was used, giving a cycle time of 34 min.\\nTandem MS was performed by monitoring precursor to\\nproduct transitions under individually optimized condi-\\ntions, typically from the most abundant [M+nH]n+ precur-\\nsor ion to an ammonium ion. For BoNT-A, the N-terminal\\nproduct 1699.9 m/z, triply charged ion (567.5 m/z) frag-\\nmenting to 84 m/z, was monitored. For BoNT-B, the dou-\\nbly charged ion (880.7 m/z) fragmenting to 84 m/z was\\nmonitored. For BoNT-E, the C-terminal product (705.8\\nm/z), doubly charged ion 353.7 →84.0 amu, was moni-\\ntored. For BoNT-F, the triply charged ion (587.6 m/z) frag-\\nmenting to 84.1 m/z was monitored. All reaction runs and\\ntransitions were monitored for the entire 32-min run time.\\nIsotopically labeled product peptides for BoNT-A (432 m/z\\n→70 m/z and 368.8 m/z →70 m/z) were used as an inter-\\nnal standard for accurate quantification. \\nResults and Discussion\\nWe developed a rapid, sensitive method for detecting\\nand differentiating BoNT serotypes A, B, E, and F. Each\\nBoNT serotype recognizes and cleaves a unique site on\\neither SNAP-25 or VAMP-2 (Figure 1). We synthesized\\nRESEARCH\\n1580\\nEmerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 11, No. 10, October 2005\\nFigure 2. Substrate peptide sequences, the botulinum neurotoxin\\n(BoNT) serotype predicted cleavage product sequences, and\\nmasses of the substrate and product peptides. Peptides for\\nBoNT-A and -E were derived from the human SNAP (synaptoso-\\nmal-associated protein)-25 protein. The substrate peptide for\\nBoNT A, 187-SNKTRIDEANQRATKML-203, was modified to\\nbiotin(ε)-KG(K189->R and K201->R)GGK-(ε)Biotin. The BoNT-E\\nsubstrate sequence was also from human SNAP-25 (156–186).\\nSubstrate peptides for BoNT-B and -F are from human synapto-\\nbrevin 2; the BoNT-B substrate (3) is from 59–93 in the sequence\\nand the BoNT-F substrate is from 35–74.\\nthe specific portions of SNAP-25 and VAMP that are sub-\\nstrates for the 4 BoNT serotypes that commonly cause\\nhuman botulism (serotypes A, B, E, and F). We used the\\nendopeptidase activity to detect and differentiate the spe-\\ncific BoNT serotype by allowing the BoNT to cleave its\\nspecific peptide substrate and detecting the cleavage prod-\\nucts by mass spectrometry. \\nThe substrate peptides were designed to be the same as\\nthe sequences of those portions of the natural SNAP-25\\n(for BoNT-A and -E) or VAMP (for BoNT-B and -F) that\\nare recognized and cleaved, except some modifications\\nwere made for BoNT-A and -B. For BoNT-A, the peptide\\nfrom SNAP-25 that includes serine-187 to glycine-206 is\\nrequired for cleavage at glutamine-196. Schmidt et al.\\nfound that replacing lysines 189 and 201 with arginines\\nshowed enhanced cleavage by BoNT-A (14). We also\\nfound an increase in the amount of BoNT-dependent cleav-\\nage products detected in the modified peptides. The por-\\ntion of VAMP-2 required for cleavage by BoNT-B at\\nglutamine-75 is leucine-59 to lysine-93, and the portion\\nrequired for cleavage by BoNT-F at glutamine-57 is from\\nalanine-36 to serine-74. The portion of SNAP-25 from\\nisoleucine-156 to aspartic acid-186 is required for cleav-\\nage between arginine-180 and isoleucine-181 by BoNT-E.\\nWe biotinylated the N and C termini of the substrate pep-\\ntide for BoNT-A so that the product peptides of interest can\\nbe easily purified from complex matrices. After final pep-\\ntide sequences are determined, we plan to biotinylate all\\nsubstrate peptides.\\nThe method was multiplexed by combining all 4 sub-\\nstrate peptides for the BoNT serotypes A, B, E, and F into a\\nsample that contained various levels of a single BoNT\\nserotype or no toxin. The expected product peptide masses\\nand the masses of the substrate peptides are shown in Figure\\n2. The product peptides for each specific BoNT serotype\\ncan be easily distinguished by their mass. The online\\nAppendix Figure (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11\\nno10/04-1279_app.htm) shows typical results for each of\\nthe reaction mixtures containing the 4 substrate peptides\\nincubated with only the reaction buffer (a blank) or with 1\\nof the BoNT serotypes. Each of the BoNT serotypes yield-\\ned only the expected cleavage products from its respective\\nsubstrate peptides, indicating that this method can easily\\ndetect and differentiate active BoNT serotypes. No cleavage\\nwas observed in the reactions that did not contain BoNT.\\nAdditionally, even at this relatively high toxin level, no\\ncross-reactivity was seen between the toxin types; only the\\nexpected peptide cleavage reactions were observed.  \\nWe also tested sensitivity of the method for each single\\ntoxin serotype with a single substrate peptide. Since enzy-\\nmatic reactions tend to be concentration dependent, this\\ntesting was accomplished in 2 ways. First, we determined\\nthe sensitivity on the basis of the lowest absolute amount\\nof toxin that could be detected by the Endopep-MS method\\nin a 20-µL reaction; second, we determined the lowest con-\\ncentration per milliliter that could be detected by this\\nmethod. The first approach indicates the minimum amount\\nof toxin that needs to be present, and the second indicates\\nthe minimum concentration of toxin in a sample. For\\nBoNT serotypes A, B, and F as little as 0.01 MLD50 yield-\\ned sufficient quantities of product peptides to be clearly\\ndetected by MALDI-TOF-MS. This figure is 100× lower\\nin the absolute amount of toxin than that required by the\\nmouse bioassay. For BoNT-E, product peptides could be\\ndetected by MALDI-TOF-MS with as little as 0.08\\nMLD50. The analytic sensitivity of the method was then\\ntested to determine the lowest measurable concentration of\\nthe toxin. An aliquot of a 1-mL sample that contained 100\\nMLD50 to 0.31 mouse LD50 in water was tested by both the\\nMALDI-TOF-MS and HPLC-ESI/MS/MS methods.\\nReactions were also allowed to proceed for 4 h and for 16\\nh. The 4-h reactions for BoNT-A, -B, and -E showed the\\nsensitivity by MALDI-TOF-MS detection of the product\\npeptides of 1.2 mouse LD50/mL for BoNT-A and -B and\\n6.2 mouse LD50/mL for BoNT-E. After 16-h reactions, the\\nsensitivity was 0.62 mouse LD50/mL for BoNT-A and -B,\\n0.31 mouse LD50/mL for BoNT-E, and 6.2 mouse LD50/mL\\nfor BoNT-F. Using HPLC-ESI/MS/MS to analyze these\\nsame low toxin samples, we found that after 16-h incuba-\\ntion, the detection limits were 0.62 mouse LD50/mL for\\nBoNT-A and -B, <0.31 MLD50/mL for BoNT-E, and 0.62\\nMLD50/mL for BoNT-F. These data indicate that the\\nEndopep-MS method is very sensitive with respect to the\\namount and concentration of toxin and that methods that\\ncan concentrate active toxins into smaller reaction vol-\\numes (thus yielding higher concentration) will result in\\nlower limits of detection. \\nThe HPLC-ESI/MS/MS technique to quantitatively\\ndetect and differentiate BoNT activities is highly selective.\\nCorrect identification of the BoNT product peptides\\ndepends on both a retention time match, with respect to\\nstandards, and on a chemical-specific fragmentation (a\\nprecursor to product ion multiple reaction monitoring\\n[MRM] transition) monitored by tandem MS. To further\\nenhance selectivity, 2 separate MRM transitions can be\\nmonitored for each peptide. In addition, our HPLC-\\nESI/MS/MS technique is very sensitive. Quantification of\\nthe BoNT product peptides is achieved by using stable iso-\\ntope-labeled internal standards that have the same\\nsequence as the native product peptides but are labeled\\nwith 13C. Figure 3 shows typical HPLC-ESI/MS/MS chro-\\nmatograms obtained during the quantification of the activ-\\nity of BoNT-A, and a standard curve for both of the\\nproduct peptides. The amount of product peptide was then\\ncorrelated with the amount of toxin that yielded the\\nproduct peptides. Standard curves between 10 and 1,000\\nBotulinum Neurotoxin Detection and Differentiation\\nEmerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 11, No. 10, October 2005\\n1581\\nMLD50 were prepared, and individual spiked samples were\\nrun as unknown samples to determine the accuracy and\\nprecision of the method. The spiked samples were pre-\\npared at 16, 32, 65, and 125 MLD50; 2 samples were run in\\nduplicate at each spike level giving a total of 4 measure-\\nments. The accuracy and precision of these measurements,\\nshown in the Table, were good; relative standard devia-\\ntions were <2%–5%. This method is the first that can accu-\\nrately quantify BoNT enzymatic activity. Identical\\nHPLC-ESI/MS/MS strategies can be used to quantify each\\nof the BoNT serotypes. \\nThe Endopep-MS method has many possible applica-\\ntions. Beyond using the Endopep-MS method for identify-\\ning the BoNT serotype in a clinical, food, or environmental\\nsample, standardizing BoNT activity in samples used for\\nclinical treatment or research activities may be possible.\\nThe standardization of BoNT, both the amount of 150-kDa\\ntoxin and the activity of a standard solution, is of great\\nimportance in the medical use of BoNT (16). A possible\\nstrategy for standardizing BoNT includes correlating the\\nactivity obtained by the mouse bioassay to the Endopep-MS\\nmethod. Additionally, it may be possible to correlate this\\nactivity to an absolute amount of toxin that is determined in\\na similar fashion as was done for apolipoprotein A-1 (17).\\nEndopep-MS currently has limitations. Mass spectrom-\\netry equipment is expensive and requires a high level of\\ntechnical expertise for optimal operation. The method still\\nneeds to be tested in a wide variety of clinical and food\\nsamples and may require the use of protease inhibitors and\\naffinity chromatography to partially purify and concentrate\\nthe toxin. Also, the Endopep-MS method needs to be vali-\\ndated against the mouse bioassay. The method also has\\nseveral strengths. It is rapid, and in simple matrices, such\\nas water and buffer, it can obtain similar sensitivities to the\\nmouse in <5 h. Samples can be prepared for the reactions\\nin minutes; incubation times of only 4 h yield sensitivity\\nclose to the mouse bioassay, and MALDI-TOF mass spec-\\ntra can be collected in <1 min. Samples can also be\\nbatched so that 50 samples can be analyzed in <6 h. The\\nHPLC-ESI/MS/MS analysis is somewhat slower than the\\nMALDI-TOF-MS, and each sample requires 30 min.\\nHowever, this process has been automated, and batches of\\nsamples can run unattended so that 40 samples a day can\\nbe processed and run by HPLC-ESI/MS/MS. The method\\nis well suited for multiplexing and can not only detect but\\nalso differentiate toxin type in a single analytic run. \\nConclusions\\nWe developed a method based on the unusually specif-\\nic endopeptidase activity of BoNT that uses highly selec-\\ntive mass spectrometry analysis to detect and differentiate\\nBoNT serotypes A, B, E and F. This method is rapid and\\nsensitive. When the endopeptidase reactions are allowed to\\nproceed for 16 h, it is highly sensitive; 100× more sensitive\\nin absolute amounts of active toxin for BoNT-A, -B,\\nand -F and >10× more sensitive than the mouse bioassay\\nfor BoNT-E. Since each BoNT serotype has a unique\\ncleavage site on a substrate peptide, this analysis lends\\nitself well to multiplexing. We multiplexed the analysis\\nand showed that no cross-reactivity occurs within the 4\\nBoNT serotypes. The Endopep-MS method should be very\\nuseful to rapidly detect and differentiate active BoNT in a\\nvariety of clinical, food, or environmental samples to\\nquickly establish the serotype(s) and aid in identifying a\\nsource during an outbreak. It may also prove useful for\\nstandardizing BoNT enzymatic activity for preparations\\nused as clinical treatments or for research activities. This\\ntype of approach may also prove useful for detecting other\\nproteolytic toxins.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank Susan Maslanka for many helpful discussions and\\na thoughtful review of this manuscript and James Pirkle for his\\nsupport and guidance throughout the method development. \\nRESEARCH\\n1582\\nEmerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 11, No. 10, October 2005\\nFigure 3.

Taylor*, Jennifer E. Taylor, Igal Raizman, Allan E. Gross\\nABSTRACT: Total hip replacement is considered to be a highly successful and routine surgery;\\nhowever, the internal components produce particles through friction and wear in the device. These\\nparticles are identified as one of the main reasons for total hip revisions. The generated, biologically\\nactive, particles provoke the formation of osteolytic areas through the inhibition of bone formation and\\nincreased fluid production. The resulting bone loss can be managed through the use of allograft bone in\\ncombination with bone chips and cement. In addition, implants constructed with highly porous\\ntrabecular metal can be used to further facilitate rapid and extensive tissue infiltration resulting in\\nstrong implant attachment. In this case study we show the use of a tibial allograft coupled with bone\\nchips and cement to cover and support a lytic cyst in the proximal femur, distal to the greater\\ntrochanter. Additionally, we detail the use of a trabecular metal cup to halt the migration of the\\ncomponent into the acetabulum and promote greater fixation and bone ingrowth.\\nKEYWORDS: Revision Hip Arthroplasty, Allograft, Osteolysis, Particle Disease, Trabecular Metal\\nless wear on the prosthesis (4). However, despite the\\nvariances in particle generation of different materials,\\nosteolysis is indicated in all types of hip replacements.\\nStrictly defined, osteolysis refers to an aggressive local\\nbone resorbtion. Particle debris generated from the\\nmechanical wear of prosthetic devices is known to alter\\nthe function of multiple cell types in the periprosthetic\\narea, including macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts,\\nand osteoclasts (5-7). The generated biologically active\\nparticles appear to provoke the formation of lytic areas\\nthrough the inhibition of bone formation and increased\\nfluid production (8-10). These cysts ultimately lead to\\nimplant loosening.\\nBones are highly dynamic tissues undergoing a\\nconstant remodeling process that is regulated by a\\ntightly-controlled balance of osteoblast and osteoclast\\nactivity. The major challenge of revision hip\\narthroplasty is related to osteolysis and bone loss\\ndecreasing stability of the implant. Revision of the\\nacetabular component can be especially challenging\\nbecause of deficient bone stock. The loss of bone can\\nsurmount due to surgical bone loss from the primary\\noperation, migration of the cup, and as mentioned\\npreviously, \\nparticle \\ninduced \\nosteolysis \\n(11).\\nConsequently, the goal of revision hip surgery should be\\nanatomical placement of the acetabular component, but\\nINTRODUCTION\\nTotal hip replacement is considered to be a highly\\nsuccessful and routine surgery. It is estimated that over\\na million such medical procedures occur annually\\nworld-wide. However, despite the minimal rate of early\\ncomplications, up to 30% of all surgeries are revised\\nwithin 10-14 years of initial surgery (1). Every\\nprosthetic hip replacement available produces particles.\\nThese particles are identified as one of the main causal\\nreasons for total hip arthroplasty. The wear between\\nprimary binding surfaces of the femoral head and\\nacetabular components in total hip replacements is\\nconsidered to be the most significant source of\\nprosthetic particles (2).\\nOne estimation, from a study utilizing a metal on\\npolyethylene joint, suggested the generation of\\nhundreds of thousands of polyethylene particles during\\neach gait cycle (3). Another study found that metal-on-\\nmetal or ceramic-on-ceramic pairings had significantly\\n22\\nMcGill Journal of Medicine\\n2009\\nX-rays showed significant osteolysis of the proximal\\nfemur, distal to the greater trochanter of his left hip\\n(Figure 1). Despite the bone loss, the stem appeared to\\nstill be solid. In addition, significant wear of the left cup\\nwas observed. It was anticipated that the progressive\\nwear of the polyethylene cup would induce small\\nparticle disease involving the greater and lesser\\ntrochanter areas. X-rays had been taken 5 years prior to\\nevaluate the aging arthroplasty. Comparison to the\\ncurrent x-rays (Figure 1) revealed that the particle\\ndisease had expanded and significantly increased the\\nendosteal lytic zone, it was also evident that the ceramic\\nhead had penetrated deeper into the acetabulum. The\\nright hip was not radiologically or symptomatically\\nthreatened at the presented time. To avoid impending\\nfemoral fracture or avulsion of the greater trochanter\\nfrom lytic bone loss, revision of the left hip was\\nscheduled.\\nOPERATIVE TECHNIQUE\\nSince the stem had good fixation, the choice was\\nmade to leave it in place and use a bone graft to support\\nthe lucent area distal to the greater trochanter. A tibial\\nallograft was used to secure the femoral component and\\nstabilize the lytic area. The allograft was irradiated with\\n2.5 Mrad (25,000 Gy) in the hospital bone bank,\\naccrediated by the American Association of Tissue\\nBanks, and consequently stored at -70 degrees Celsius.\\nThe approximate allograft size was templated\\npreoperatively and a longer graft ordered to account for\\nany intraoperative adjustments. The allograft was only\\nbrought into the operating room after possible infection\\nof the to-be-revised hip was ruled out. In order to reduce\\noperative time, the allograft was prepared on a separate\\ntable by members of the surgical team while the\\nthis can be difficult to achieve in cases where contact\\nbetween host bone and the implant is diminished. This\\nbone loss can be managed by either filling the absent\\narea with cement, the use of allograft bone, or by using\\nspecial implants such as those constructed with\\ntrabecular metal (12-16). Allograft incorporation can be\\nimplemented to reinforce the lytic area, thereby\\nstabilizing the implant. Allografts do not suffer from\\nosteoclastic invasion and it has been shown that\\nosteoblasts deposit osteoid across the host bone and the\\ndead graft (17). This union results in an increased\\nmechanical resistance that is indicated by increased\\nradiological density throughout the graft (18).\\nThe structure of trabecular metal resembles bone and\\napproximates its physical and mechanical properties\\nmore closely than other prosthetic materials. The highly\\nporous trabecular configuration is conducive to bone\\ningrowth, facilitating rapid and extensive tissue\\ninfiltration resulting in strong implant attachment (19).\\nTrabecular metal consists of interconnecting pores\\nresulting in a crystalline micro-textured biomaterial that\\nis 80% porous. This allows for greater tissue ingrowth\\n(2-3 fold higher compared to conventional porous\\ncoatings) with approximately double the interface shear\\nstrength (19). In hip arthroplasties, porous trabecular\\nmetal facilitates bone ingrowth and fixation of the\\ndevice; multiple studies have shown that most\\nreplacements can be reconstructed with an uncemented\\ntrabecular hemispherical cup with screws with or\\nwithout morselized bone graft (20-22). Because of their\\nporous surface and mechanical properties trabecular\\nmetal cups provide a promising approach for offering a\\nbetter environment for bone graft remodeling (23). In\\nthis case study we detail the use of a trabecular metal\\ncup to halt the migration of the component into the\\nacetabulum and promote greater fixation and bone\\ningrowth. Additionally, we show the use of a tibial\\nallograft coupled with bone chips and cement to cover\\nand support a lytic cyst in the proximal femur, distal to\\nthe greater trochanter. \\nCASE STUDY\\nA 73 year old man presented with instability in the left\\nhip, 17 years after bilateral hip arthroplasty was\\ncompleted. The original replacement was a ceramic\\nhead on a polyethylene lined acetabular component.\\nStill working full time and an active individual,\\ninstability and loss of control began to impede on his\\ndaily activities. Sharp pain presented down the lateral\\naspect of his left leg during jarring actions. During\\nphysical examination, good range of motion and gait\\nwas displayed in both hips, although pain was produced\\nduring forced external rotation of the left hip. Leg\\nlength was equal.\\nFigure 1: Pre-operative X-rays in the coronal plane. Lucency in the\\nlesser and greater trochanter is evident with the endosteal lytic area\\nmarked by a white arrow. It is also apparent that the left acetabular\\ncomponent has pushed deeper into the acetabulum.\\nHip Arthroplasty\\n23\\nVol. 12  No. 1\\nrevision was initiated. The femoral component had\\ngood fixation so additional bone ingrowth was not a\\nmajor concern. Thus, cement was used to fill in the lytic\\narea and provide additional structural support.\\nPolymethylmethacrylate bone cement has been known\\nto strengthen allograft bone, impair resorbtion, and\\nallow for the delivery of antibiotics (24). Cement was\\nnot used between the allograft and the host bone, only\\nin the lytic area between the allograft and the implant,\\nso as not to impair healing at the host-donor interface.\\nAdditionally, morselized bone from the allograft was\\nused between contact sites of host and donor bone in an\\neffort to increase bone ingrowth. Finally wire was used\\nto secure the allograft to the femur.\\nOperative visualization confirmed the cup had\\nprotruded into the acetabulum and wear on the\\npolyethylene lining was evident, necessitating its\\nreplacement. A Zimmer Trilogy™ Acetabular System\\nwas selected to replace the acetabular component,\\nconsisting of a metal shell, polyethylene liner, and\\nscrews. The shell, made from Tivanium™ Ti-6Al-4V\\nalloy, is pourous to allow for fixation with Tivanium™\\nalloy cortical screws. In this case, three 6.5mm screws\\nof lengths 25, 30, and 35mm were used to secure the\\ncup into the acetabulum. The original cup was\\nuncemented, 56mm in size and was replaced with a\\nsimilar 56mm trabecular metal cup. The porous\\ntrabecular metal serves to facilitate bone ingrowth and\\nincreased fixation of the arthrography. Bone chips from\\nthe excess allograft were also used to fill in the\\nprotruded acetabulum from the original implant. This\\nwill further stimulate bone growth in and around the\\nnew trabecular component.\\nDISCUSSION\\nImmediately following the surgery the patient was\\ntaken to radiology for post-operative x-rays (Figure 2).\\nRevision of the acetabular component with a trabecular\\nmetal cup was then visualized and correct placement\\nwithin the acetabulum was confirmed. The original\\nfemoral component was also visualized, shown\\nreinforced with a well placed tibial allograft. \\nPost-operative management of the revision hip\\nreplacement includes a diligent rehabilitation program.\\nRevision cases are usually rehabilitated more\\nconservatively than primary replacements, as was the\\ncase here. This patient was treated with additional care\\ndue to the use of allograft bone to stabilize the femoral\\ncomponent. During the first week post-op, progressive\\nambulation remains the primary goal. Our patient was\\nencouraged to begin range-of-motion ankle exercises\\nand moving with a walker/assistance 5 to 10 feet the\\nfirst day after surgery which was done with success.\\nThroughout the first week, aided walking was extended\\nto 25-45 feet and stair-climbing with crutches was\\nintroduced after day 5. Stair climbing and other motions\\nthat bend the knee must be watched carefully as for the\\nfirst 3 months the patient is advised not to bend their\\nknee past 90 degrees. This helps to avoid dislocation\\nand damage to the hip and device. The patient\\nprogressed very well through the rehabilitation program\\nas proposed.\\nAdditional x-rays were taken after 3 months to\\nconfirm fixation of the aetabular component and\\nevaluate the success of the tibial allograft over the\\nosteolytic area in the proximal femur (Figure 3). The\\nacetabular component appeared to be well placed and\\nthe observed migration into the acetabulum was halted.\\nThe tibial allograft, marked with a white arrow, remains\\nin place supporting the area of osteolysis. The level of\\nFigure 3: Coronal X-rays taken 3 months post-operatively. The\\nacetabular component appears to be well placed and the progressive\\npush into the acetabulum appears to be corrected. The tibial allograft,\\nmarked with a white arrow, remains in place supporting the area of\\nosteolysis. The level of transparency has reduced significantly after\\ncleaning out the cyst and filling the lytic zone with biocompatible\\ncement.\\nFigure 2: X-ray of the left\\nhip after surgery. Revision\\nof \\nthe \\nacetabular\\ncomponent \\nwith \\na\\ntrabecular metal cup is\\nmarked with a black\\narrow. \\nThe \\noriginal\\nfemoral component is\\nshown reinforced with a\\ntibial allograft, marked by\\na white arrow.\\n23\\nMcGill Journal of Medicine\\n2009\\ntransparency had reduced significantly after successful\\ncleaning of the cyst and filling the lytic zone with\\nbiocompatible polymethylmethacrylate bone cement.\\nPhysical examination was completed at the same time\\nas x-rays to ensure the patient had continued with the\\nrehabilitation program and was continuing to make\\nsignificant progress. Ambulation, range of motion, and\\nfunctionality were all observed and were progressing\\nwell. The patient is now fully recovered, ambulating\\nand functioning without pain or discomfort.\\nFor reasons including particle disease, revision of\\ntotal hip replacements generally occur upon indication\\nof a painful loose prosthesis. Davis et al. (25) used the\\nWestern \\nOntario \\nand \\nMcMaster \\nUniversities\\nOsteoarthritis (WOMAC) questionnaire to grade pain\\nand function pre- and 2-year-postoperatively. The study\\nreported that a higher pain level and number of\\ncomorbidities before the surgery predicted poorer\\noutcomes at 24 month post-surgical follow-up. Patients\\nwith better preoperative WOMAC pain and function\\nscores had better scores postoperatively, suggesting the\\nbenefit of performing total hip revision not only to\\nrelieve current symptoms, but to reduce the chance that\\npain and function will worsen while waiting for surgery.\\nIn this case, loosening was first noticed by the patient\\nthrough instability and loss of gait control and later\\nconfirmed through radiography. If surgery had waited\\nuntil higher levels of pain were expressed to maximize\\nthe life of the original device, more serious\\ncomplications may have occurred. By performing the\\nrevision more complicated surgeries with worse\\noutcomes, potentially for failure due to fracture, are\\navoided. The use of allograft is shown as an effective\\nway to support components threatened with osteolysis.\\nDonor bone in combination with biocompatible cement\\ncan greatly reduce the potential for injury and pain due\\nto lytic bone loss. \\nREFERENCES\\n1. \\nDuffy, G.

This study aimed to assess performance of interferon-gamma\\nrelease assay (IGRA) in diagnosis of active tuberculosis (ATB) with pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvements, and to\\ndetermine the diagnostic role of IGRA (T-SPOT.TB) and tuberculin skin test (TST) in BCG-vaccinated population.\\nMethods and Findings: Two hundred twenty-six ATB suspects were recruited and examined with T-SPOT.TB. Among them,\\nfifty-two and seventy-six subjects were simultaneously tested by TST with 5TU or 1TU of purified protein derivative (PPD).\\nThe sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB was 94.7% (71/75), comparable in pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease groups (95.6% vs.\\n93.3%, P.0.05), while the specificity was 84.10% (90/107) but differed in two groups (69.2% vs. 88.9%, P = 0.02). Compared\\nto T-SPOT.TB, TST with 5TU-PPD showed less sensitivity (92.3% vs. 56.4%) and specificity (84.6% vs. 61.5%) (both P,0.01);\\nthe sensitivity of TST with 1TU-PPD was 27.8%, and despite its specificity identical to T-SPOT.TB (both 82.8%) positive\\npredictive value (PPV) was only 33.3%.

Although the TB\\nvaccine Bacille Calmette-Gue´rin (BCG) is broadly vaccinated and\\nDOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) programme\\nis well implemented, the incidence rate of active tuberculosis\\n(ATB) in China has been doubled over ten years (39.03/100,000\\nin 1999 vs. 81.09/100,000 in 2009), with the death rate soaring 7-\\nfold in this decade [1]. Despite incorporation of clinical,\\nradiological,\\npathological\\nand\\nmicrobiological\\nexaminations,\\ndiagnosis of ATB can still be difficult. Conclusive diagnostic tests\\nmicrobial culture and smear for acid-fast bacilli are not sensitive\\nenough to identify all the active cases. Moreover, for extrapulmo-\\nnary tuberculosis (EPTB), less specific clinical clues can be used\\nand invasive procedures or low bacterial load leads to less chance\\nto establish the pathological or microbiologic diagnosis [2,3].\\nImmunoassays capable of detecting the host’s immune response\\nspecific to TB causative agent Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (M.TB) has\\nbecome an alternative diagnostic aid for ATB [2]. Long-time-used\\ntuberculin skin test (TST) has encountered considerable difficul-\\nties, mainly due to the disability of its mixed antigens tuberculin\\npurified protein derivative (PPD) to distinguish the true ATB\\npatients from those vaccinated with BCG or sensitized with\\nNontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) [4]. Recently, interferon-gamma\\nrelease assays (IGRAs) have shown their superior diagnostic\\nperformance over TST [4,5,6,7,8,9] by using at least two specific\\nantigens (ESAT-6 & CFP 10) present exclusively in M.TB but\\nabsent in BCG strains and most NTM [9,10]. Herein, we put\\nELISpot-based-IGRA (T-SPOT.TB) into test to examine how it\\nworks especially for identifying EPTB in comparison with\\npulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Meanwhile, we compared the\\nperformance between IGRA and TST with two currently used\\ndoses (5TU; 1TU) to elaborate whether TST is still strong enough\\nto carry on the diagnostic role in ATB for the TB-epidemic and\\nBCG vaccinated populations.\\nMethods\\nThis study got ethical approval from Huashan Institutional\\nReview Board (HIRB), the ethics reviewing committee of Huashan\\nHospital, Fudan University. Informed consent was obtained from\\nall the participants in the written form.\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n1\\nMarch 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32652\\nStudy population\\nA prospective study was conducted in HIV-negative subjects\\nwith suspicion of active TB collected between September 2008 and\\nSeptember 2009. A total of 226 patients from China were tested\\nwith T-SPOT.TBH at enrollment, together with routine clinical,\\nmicrobiologic, pathological and radiographic examinations. Indi-\\nviduals were excluded if they have received .30 days of anti-\\ntuberculosis therapy or if they have received the treatment within\\none year prior to enrollment; those treated for one year or longer\\nbefore enrollment were otherwise involved. All patients were\\nvaccinated with BCG at early childhood or during adolescence.\\nMajor clinical characteristics of recruited subjects were summa-\\nrized in Table 1.\\nAfter a follow-up of at least 3 months, by January 2010, 44\\npatients were excluded from the study, among which 10 died\\nbefore final diagnosis, 17 lost follow-up, and 17 had no final\\ndiagnosis. The remaining 182 patients were ultimately included for\\nT-SPOT.TB analyses (Figure 1), of which 128 consented to\\nperform TST concurrently, 76 with 1TU-PPD, and 52 with 5TU-\\nPPD.\\nDefinitions and Diagnosis\\nTB suspects were defined as patients whose clinical or\\nradiographic manifestations were consistent with active TB [11],\\nbut lack of culture or pathological evidence for confirmative\\ndiagnosis. Finally, they had one of three diagnoses: (1) ‘culture/\\nbiopsy-confirmed ATB’ if final diagnoses were made on the\\npositive culture of M. TB from sputum or the presence of caseating\\ngranuloma in biopsy specimen; (2) ‘clinical ATB’ if patients, whose\\nclinical presentations were consistent with ATB but lack of\\nbacterial/pathological corroborative evidence, presented manifest\\nclinical or radiographic responses to anti-TB treatment; (3) ‘no\\nATB’ if the patients did not meet the above two criteria and their\\nclinical presentations diminished spontaneously or following non-\\nTB-related treatment.\\nT-SPOT.TB assay\\nThe T-SPOT.TB test was performed following the instructions\\nof the assay kit (Oxford Immunote Ltd., Oxford, UK). Briefly,\\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and\\nincubated with two antigens (ESAT-6 in panel A; CFP-10 in panel\\nB). The procedure was performed in the plates pre-coated with\\nanti-interferon-c antibodies at 37uC for 16 to 20 hours. After\\nTable 1.

The size of the induration was read at 72 h. Based on the\\ntransverse diameter of induration, the cut-off value was deter-\\nmined as follows: induration ,10 mm denoted as negative (2);\\ninduration $10 mm as positive (+).The TST and T-SPOT.TB\\nwere all conducted simultaneously.\\nStatistical analyses\\nSensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative\\npredictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio positive (LR+), and\\nlikelihood ratio negative (LR2) were calculated to evaluate\\ndiagnostic performance for the T-SPOT.TB and TST. Ninety-\\nfive percent confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated accord-\\ning to the binomial distribution. Significance was inferred for\\nP,0.05. Concordance between the results of TST and T-\\nSPOT.TB was assessed using k coefficients (k.0.75, excellent\\nagreement; k,0.4, poor agreement; 0.75$k$0.4, fair to good\\nagreement). Analyses were performed using statistical software\\npackages (Stata version 9; StataCorp; College Station, TX).\\nResults\\nClinical characteristics\\nOf 182 ATB suspects with valid T-SPOT.TB results, 71 were\\ncategorized into pulmonary disease group and 111 in extrapul-\\nmonary disease group (Figure 1). Patients with EPTB concur-\\nrently with documented PTB were included into PTB group.\\nEventually, 107 patients excluded ATB and 75 were diagnosed as\\nATB. Of the latter, 45 were confirmed with culture/biopsy\\nevidences, and 30 as probable ATB cases with clinical evidences.\\nClinical characteristics of 182 patients are shown in Table 1. The\\ndistribution\\nof\\naffected\\nextrapulmonary\\norgans\\nwas\\nhighly\\nheterogeneous which involved central nervous system, peripheral\\nlymph nodes, pleura, bones, genitourinary system, gastrointesti-\\nnal tract, and skin (Table 2).\\nDiagnostic performance of T-SPOT.TB: overall and\\nstratified by disease site\\nThe diagnostic values of T-SPOT.TB for the 182 subjects are\\npresented in Table 3. The overall sensitivity and specificity were\\n94.70%\\n(95%CI,\\n86.9%–98.5%),\\n84.10%\\n(95%CI,\\n75.8%–\\n90.5%), respectively. There was no significant difference in the\\nsensitivity between the ‘confirmed ATB’ cases (93.3%, 42/45) and\\nthe ‘clinical ATB’ cases (96.7%, 29/30; P.0.05). PPV, NPV, LR+\\nand LR2 of the T-SPOT.TB were 80.70%, 95.70%, 5.96 and\\n0.06, respectively, and the prevalence was 41.2% in the cohort\\n(Table 3).\\nThe stratified performance by the site of disease is shown in\\ntable 2. Among the 71 patients with pulmonary involvement, T-\\nSPOT.TB was positive in 43 of 45 ATB cases, with a sensitivity of\\n95.6% (95%CI: 84.9%–99.5%) which did not differ significantly\\nfrom the sensitivity of 93.3% (95%CI: 77.9%–99.2%) in extra-\\npulmonary disease group (28/30). However, the specificity was\\n69.2% (95%CI: 48.2%–85.7%) in pulmonary disease group, while\\na higher specificity was observed in extrapulmonary disease group\\n(88.9%;\\n95%CI:\\n80.0%–94.8%;\\nP = 0.017).\\nThe\\nresults\\nof\\nextrapulmonary disease group were further stratified by affected\\nsites. Notably, apart from pleura (50%; 1/2) and abdomen\\ntuberculosis (83.3%; 5/6), the sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB was as\\nhigh as 100% for the most affected sites, while the specificity\\nranged from 60% to 97% (Table 2).\\nRisk factors for false-positive outcomes in T-SPOT.TB:\\noverall and stratified by disease site\\nA number of risk characteristics of patients associated with false-\\npositive and false-negative results were evaluated by multivariate\\nlogistic regression. Age$median age (46-year)’ and ‘history of\\nprior TB’ were turned out to be two independent risk factors\\nrelated to false-positive outcomes. Odds ratio (OR) between false-\\npositives and true-positives for overall, and in pulmonary and\\nextrapulmonary groups are present individually in Table 4. For\\nthe risk factor of ‘age$median age’, the overall OR was 5.09\\n(95%CI 1.28–20.25; P = 0.021) whereas 10.71 (95%CI 1.21–\\nTable 2.

Additionally, No risk factors to false-negatives were\\nelicited.\\nComparisons between T-SPOT.TB and TST with two\\ndoses of PPD\\nIn search of the best strategy for active tuberculosis immunodi-\\nagnosis, we examined subjects with TST using two PPD strengths:\\n76 subjects with 1 TU PPD (abbreviated to ‘TST1TU-PPD’), and 52\\nwith 5 TU (TST5TU-PPD). T-SPOT.TB was simultaneously applied\\nto the two cohorts. The diagnostic values of ‘TST1TU-PPD vs. T-\\nSPOT.TB’ and ‘TST5TU-PPD vs. T-SPOT.TB’ were listed in\\nTable 5. A statistically significant difference in sensitivity was found\\nbetween\\nTST1TU-PPD\\nand\\nT-SPOT.TB\\n(27.8%\\nvs.\\n94.4%;\\nP,0.001), but no difference in specificity was observed as they\\nshared the same value (both 82.8%, P = 1.000). The PPV and NPV\\nwas 33.3% and 78.7% for TST1TU-PPD, and was 63.0% and 98.0%\\nfor the T-SPOT.TB, respectively. TST5TU-PPD significantly differed\\nfrom T-SPOT.TB both in sensitivity (56.4% vs. 92.3%, P = 0.001)\\nand specificity (61.5% vs. 84.6%, P = 0.0078). The PPV and NPV\\nwas 81.5% and 32.0% for TST5TU-PPD, and was 94.7% and\\n78.6% for the T-SPOT.TB, respectively. When the concordance\\nwas assessed by kappa coefficient (k), poor agreement was\\nshown between either comparison, 67.11% for ‘T-SPOT.TB vs.\\nTST1TU-PPD’\\n(k = 0.19)\\nand\\n63.46%\\nfor\\n‘T-SPOT.TB\\nvs.\\nTST5TU-PPD’ (k = 0.28).\\nSingle and combination diagnostic test efficiency of T-\\nSPOT.TB and TST\\nIn order to enlarge the features of immunoassays deviating\\nfrom ‘gold standard’ test, we plotted four basic diagnostic\\nparameters for two comparisons in figure 2, in which a true\\npositive/negative rate line and a false positive/negative rate line\\nwere perpendicular to each other, and the shape of a test was\\nformed by connecting its four rates. A ‘gold standard’ test creates\\na vertical line with 100% true-rates and zero false-rates, and the\\n‘fatter’ shape a test displays, the more deviation it gets. The most\\nprominent deviation in figure 2A was the false-negative rate\\n(72%) exceeded the true-positive rate (28%) for TST1TU-PPD, and\\nthe considerable loss of both true-positive and true-negative rates\\ncontributed to a nearly symmetric diamond shape for TST5TU-\\nPPD in figure 2B. By contrast, T-SPOT.TB remained a ‘slim’\\nfigure with a slight deviation toward the pole of false-positive in\\nfigure 2A and 2B.\\nWe further estimated if diagnosis efficiency could be improved\\nwhen two tests were combined by parallel and serial testing\\nalgorithms. The graphic illustration (Figure 2C and 2D) showed\\nthat parallel testing did not bring the sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB up\\nwhen combining with TST1TU-PPD or it increased from 92% to\\n95% when combining with TST5TU-PPD,but both at the expense of\\na considerable increase in false-positive rate, resulting in a similar\\nshape as T-SPOT.TB but ‘fatter’ (Figure 2C and 2D). On the\\nother hand, serial testing increased the specificity of T-SPOT.TB\\nfrom 83% to 95% when combining TST1TU-PPD, but did not\\nmake\\nany\\nimprovement\\nwhen\\ncombing\\nwith\\nTST5TU-PPD.\\nMeanwhile, the serial PPV was unchanged and decreased by\\n3.4% in the two combinations respectively (Table 6).\\nDiscussion\\nPerformance characteristics of T-SPOT.TB\\nOur study revealed a 94.7% overall sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB\\nfor detecting ATB which was parallel with our previously\\npublished data [12] and within the ranges recently reported\\nelsewhere [8,13]. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) reported\\nby different countries varies from 15% to 25% in the ATB cases\\n[14]. However, the corroborative epidemiological data for EPTB\\nis rarely available in most TB-endemic country due to diagnostic\\ndifficulties. We explored, for the first time, the role of the IGRA in\\ndetecting EPTB in Chinese patients. T-SPOT.TB turned out to be\\nsensitive equally in determining PTB and EPTB (95.6% vs. 93.3%;\\nP.0.05). In the 111 patients with extrapulmonary involvement, of\\nnote was a 100% sensitivity seen in the most investigated sites\\n(Table 2).\\nTable 3.

Aging and having TB history are known\\nto be the important factors in the individualized clinical risk\\nassessment for LTBI. Similarly, a discrepancy in specificity\\nbetween pulmonary and extrapulmonary groups (69.2% vs.\\n88.9%; P = 0.017) can also be explained by the presence of\\nsignificant difference in OR between groups. OR (10.71) for ‘over-\\nmedian age’ factor in pulmonary group inferred a nearly 11-fold\\nrisk increase caused by the factor to yield a false-positive, whereas\\nthe risk factor of age was not related to false-positives in\\nextrapulmonary group.\\nIGRAs were designed for identification of LTBI and high\\nprevalence of TB may increase the ‘false-positives’ of IGRAs such\\nthat a considerable portion of cases with LTBI could be\\nmisrecognized as ATB if relying on IGRAs. Moreover, comparing\\nwith the specificity, PPV (80.70%) and LR+ (5.96), the sensitivity,\\nNPV (95.7%) and LR2 (0.06) strongly indicated IGRAs are better\\nat ruling out ATB than ruling it in. Thus, the real role of IGRAs in\\nhigh TB-prevalence countries would be appropriate for ruling out\\na diagnosis of TB.\\nComparing immunodiagnostic strategy for patients with\\nthe history of BCG vaccination\\nThe TST suffers from the low specificity and sensitivity when\\ntested on population with high BCG-vaccination coverage and\\nhigh TB prevalence. TST using a standard dose of 5 tuberculin\\nunits (TU) PPD has been widely used, but there is always a\\ndisagreement about its role in vaccinated people. The US\\nrecommends the interpretation of TST irrespective of prior\\nBCG vaccination, resulting in considerable overdiagnosis of LTBI,\\nwhile the UK strategy probably misdiagnoses LTBI cases due to\\nthe recommendation that the serial TST be contraindicated for\\nBCG-vaccinated persons and IFN-c testing be used to help\\ninterpret positive TST results [15,16,17]. For a country having\\nserious TB burden and urgent task to treat active TB, we have to\\nknow how much we can rely on this test and how to arrange our\\nbest immunodiagnostic strategy.\\nThe study revealed that the sensitivity (56.4%) and specificity\\n(61.5%) for TST with 5TU-PPD (TST5TU-PPD) were both beneath\\nthe performance of T-SPOT.TB (Table 5) and lower than a\\nroughly 70% sensitivity and 66% specificity reported by two recent\\ncomprehensive reviews [8,18]. Meanwhile, a dose of 1 TU PPD\\n(TST1TU-PPD) has long been used to rule in TB cases in some\\nBCG-vaccinated counties like China. Its reliability faces the\\narguments for its strong specificity and against the weak sensitivity.\\nThey were both confirmed by our study (Table 5). Interestingly, a\\nnearly symmetric ‘short’ and ‘fat’ figure for TST5TU-PPD and ‘shot’\\nin sensitivity but getting ‘fat’ toward false-negative for TST1TU-PPD\\nwere graphically presented in figure 2. By contrast, T-SPOT.TB\\nremained ‘thin’ with only a slight growth in false-positive rate\\npresumably reflecting the LTBI prevalence.\\nTST1TU-PPD showing a specificity numerically identical to the\\nT-SPOT.TB was supposed to identify the presumed LTBI cases\\nlike T-SPOT.TB did, and those cases should be simultaneously\\npositive for both tests. However, our observation indicated only\\n30% of false-positives in one test were also positive for the other. It\\nwas very likely that the reasons leading to false-positive for T-\\nSPOT.TB and TST1TU-PPD may not be same: based on our study\\nand other literatures [19,20,21], T-SPOT.TB exhibited the ability\\nto detect LTBI, and TST on the other hand was very likely to\\nfalsely recognize those vaccinated with BCG or sensitized with\\nNTM even at the small dose of PPD instead of recognizing LTBI.\\nThus, the dose of 1TU-PPD appeared insensitive to elicit the\\ndetectable immune response in people with either TB infection or\\ndisease.\\nWe further investigated whether the performance of T-SPOT.\\nTB can be improved by combining with either TST1TU-PPD or\\nTST5TU-PPD. A parallel combination test is usually expected to\\nincrease sensitivity, , but we found that even at the expense of a big\\nreduction in specificity, the sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB did not\\nincrease by parallel combining with TST1TU-PPD (figure 2A and\\n2C), because the false-negative number upon combination failed\\nto decline (Table 6). Obviously, TST1TU-PPD could not help\\nincrease true-negatives by parallel testing due to its low sensitivity.\\nOn figure 2B and 2D, parallel and serial testing both displayed a\\n‘fatter’ feature than T-SPOT.TB with only growth in sensitivity\\nfrom 92% to 95%, in that TST5TU-PPD helped rule in 1 ATB case\\n(Table 6). The only big improvement in two combination ways\\nwas the specificity from 83% to 95% after serial combining the T-\\nSPOT.TB with TST1TU-PPD, but along with a paradoxically\\nunchanged PPV. A serial combination is expected to increase\\nspecificity and PPV by reducing false positives when both tests\\nmust be positive. However, a greater decrement in true-positives\\nthan in false-positives after combination suggested that the\\nlimitation of TST to identify the true-positives compromised the\\nTable 6.

Despite\\nno difference in the sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB between the\\nculture/biopsy-confirmed (n = 45) and clinical probable ATB\\n(n = 30) groups, inclusion of those probable cases in the true\\nATB group may bias the performance for both T-SPOT.TB and\\nTST and their comparisons. Besides, unbalanced factors of age\\nand TB history between comparative groups may also cause study\\nbias, The more subjectives were expected to involve into such\\ninvestigations.\\nIn conclusion, the TST played a prominent part in the detection\\nof tuberculosis, but its contribution has been on the wane as other\\nimmunoassays came into use with superior diagnostic performance\\nover it. This study demonstrated that T-SPOT.TB is a promising\\ntool for diagnosing tuberculosis with pulmonary and extrapulmo-\\nnary involvement. Moreover, not only cannot TST take major\\npart in immunodiagnosis of ATB, but it was not supported by our\\nstudy that combining TST with small or regular dose of PPD\\nwould become a routine optimized immunodiagnostic strategy in\\nthe population with high TB-prevalence and massive BCG-\\nvaccination. We highly recommend that IGRAs should be tested\\nas first priority to diagnose LTBI and ATB for those populations, if\\napplicable.\\nAuthor Contributions\\nConceived and designed the experiments: WZ LS XW.
